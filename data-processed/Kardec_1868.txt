   The Spiritist Doctrine is the result of the collective and concordant
   teaching of the Spirits. Science is called upon to present Genesis in
  accordance with the laws of nature. God proves God’s greatness and
power by immutability and not by the suspension of the divine laws. For
               God, the past and the future are the present.

                   INTRODUCTION

     To the first edition, published in January 1868
       This new work is one more step forward regarding the
consequences and applications of Spiritism. As its title indicates,
its objective is the study of three areas that have until today been
diversely interpreted and commented upon: Genesis, miracles and
predictions, and how they relate to the new laws that have resulted
from the observation of spirit phenomena.
       Two elements, or, if you will, two forces govern the
universe: the spiritual element and the material element. From the
simultaneous action of these two principles special phenomena are
born that would be inexplicable if one of these two elements were
excluded, just as the formation of water would be inexplicable if we
excluded one of its two constituent elements: oxygen and hydrogen.
       By demonstrating the existence of the spirit world and its
relations with the material world, Spiritism provides the key to
a multitude of misunderstood phenomena, which, for that very
reason, have been regarded as unbelievable by a certain class of
thinkers. Such phenomena abound in the Scriptures, and it is
because of the lack of knowledge concerning the laws that govern
them that commentators from two opposing camps, ceaselessly
spinning around in the same circle of ideas, have not been able to
reach a rational solution, some disregarding the objective data of
science, others the spiritual principle.
       The solution lies in the reciprocal action of spirit and
matter. It is true that this solution takes away the supernatural
character of most of such phenomena; however, which is better: to


                                11

                                        Introduction


accept them as resulting from the laws of nature, or to reject them
outright? Rejecting them outright pulls out the very foundation
from under the building, whereas accepting them, eliminating
only the accessories, leaves the foundation intact. That is why
Spiritism is leading so many people to believe in truths that they
had previously considered as utopias.
       As we have already stated, this work is a supplement to the
applications of Spiritism from a special point of view. Its contents
have been ready, or at least prepared, for quite some time, but
the time to publish them had not yet arrived. First, the ideas that
were meant to form its basis had to reach maturity, while, on the
other hand, the appropriateness of the circumstances had to be
taken into account. Spiritism harbors neither mysteries nor secret
theories; everything about it must be clearly stated so that each
person may judge it with a full knowledge of the facts. However,
each thing must come in its own time in order to arrive securely.
A solution given lightly before a complete elucidation of the issue
would be a cause of delay rather than advancement. Regarding
what is addressed herein, the importance of the subject obligates
us to avoid all hastiness.
       Before embarking upon the subject matter per se, it seemed
to us that we should define the respective role of the Spirits1
and the individuals involved in the work of the new doctrine.
Discarding any idea of mysticism, such preliminary considerations
are the subject of the first chapter, entitled: Character of the Spiritist
revelation. We would ask for serious attention regarding this point
because, in a certain way, it is the crux of the issue.
       In spite of the part that has fallen to human endeavor in
the development of this Doctrine, the initiative belongs to the

    Spiritist Doctrine along with the author. – Tr.

Spirits; however, it has not been formed by the personal opinion
of any one of them in particular. It is not, nor can it be, other
than the result of their collective and concordant teachings. Because
of this unique condition, it may be said to be the Spirits’ Doctrine;
otherwise, it would be only the doctrine of one spirit in particular,
and thus would have only the worth of a personal opinion.
       Universality and concordance in the teachings: such is
the essential character of the Doctrine, the very condition of its
existence. Consequently, any principle that has not received the
consecration of the test of universality cannot be considered an
integral part of such Doctrine, but simply an isolated opinion for
which Spiritism cannot assume responsibility.
       Furthermore, it is this concordant collectivity of the Spirits’
opinions, passed through the criterion of logic, that accounts for the
power of the Spiritist Doctrine and ensures its continuation. For it
to change, it would be necessary for the universality of the Spirits
to change their opinions and for them one day to contradict what
they have said. Since the source of the Doctrine resides in the Spirits’
teachings, in order for it to succumb the Spirits would have to cease
to exist. For the same reason, it will continue to prevail over personal
theories, which, unlike Spiritism, do not have roots everywhere.
       The Spirits’ Book has seen its credibility solidified only
because it is the expression of a generalized collective thought. In
April of 1867 it completed its first decade. During that time the
fundamental principles on which its foundations were set were
successively completed and developed as a result of the progressive
teachings of the Spirits, but none were contradicted by experience;
all, without exception, remained standing, more alive than ever,
whereas, of all the opposing ideas that some tried to use against
it, none prevailed, precisely because on all sides the opposite was
taught. This is a characteristic result that we can proclaim without
being vain, because we have never attributed such merit to ourselves.

                                         Introduction


       The same scruples having presided over the redaction
of our other works, we can truly state that they are according to
Spiritism because we were certain of their conformity to the overall
teachings of the Spirits. The same applies to this work, which we
can for similar reasons offer as a supplement to those preceding
it, except for a few yet-hypothetical theories, for which we have
taken the care to indicate as such, and which must be considered
as personal opinions until they are confirmed or disproved so that
the responsibility for them should not weigh upon the Doctrine.
       Furthermore, assiduous readers of “Revue Spirite”2 might
notice an outline of most of the ideas that are developed in this
latest work, as was the case with the preceding ones. For us,
the Revue is frequently a testing ground meant for probing the
opinions of both humans and spirits concerning certain principles
before accepting them as constituent parts of the Doctrine.

            Character of the
           Spiritist Revelation
       1. Can Spiritism be considered a revelation? If so, what
is its character? On what is its authenticity founded? To whom
and in what way has it been given? Is the Spiritist Doctrine a
revelation in the theological sense of the word; that is, is it at
all points the product of a secret teaching that has come from
On High? Is it absolute or is it susceptible to modification? By
bringing completely formulated truth to humans, would not
such revelation have the effect of keeping them from making
use of their own faculties, since it would spare them the work
of investigation? What authority could the teaching of the
Spirits have if they are neither infallible nor superior to human
beings? What is the usefulness of the morality they proclaim if
such morality is none other than that of Christ, a morality that
is already known? What are the new truths that the Spirits have
brought to us? Do humans have need of a revelation, and can
they not find within themselves and within their own conscience
everything that is necessary for their self-guidance? Such are the
questions on which we must focus our attention.
       2. Let us first define the meaning of the word revelation. To
reveal, from the Latin revelare, whose root is velum, veil, literally


                                 17

                           Genesis - Chapter I


means to go out from under the veil, and figuratively it means
to discover, to make something known that has been secret or
unknown heretofore. In its popular and most general definition it
means anything unknown that has been brought to light, any new
idea that places one on the trail of what one does not know.
       From this point of view, all the sciences that enable us to
know the mysteries of nature are revelations, and one could say
that there is for us an on-going revelation. Astronomy has revealed
the sidereal world that was formerly unknown to us; geology, the
formation of the earth; chemistry, the law of affinity; physiology,
the functions of the organism, etc.; Copernicus, Galileo, Newton,
Laplace, and Lavoisier were revelators.
        3. The essential characteristic of any revelation must be the
truth. To reveal a secret is to make known a fact; if the thing is
false, it is not a fact at all, and, consequently, there is no revelation.
Every revelation that is belied by the facts is no revelation at all;
even though it may be attributed to God, who can neither lie nor
be mistaken, it cannot have emanated from God. Hence, it must
be considered as a product of human conception.
       4. What is the role of a teacher with regards to his or her
students, if not that of revelator? The teacher teaches them what
they do not know, what they would have neither the time nor the
ability to discover by themselves, because knowledge is the collective
work of centuries and of a great many individuals, each having
contributed his or her share of observations from which those who
come afterward may benefit. Teaching is thus, in reality, the revelation
of certain scientific, moral, physical or metaphysical truths given by
individuals who know about them to others who do not, and who
would have continued to be ignorant of them otherwise.
      5. However, teachers teach only what they themselves have
learned; they are revelators of a second order. Geniuses, on the


                                   18

                  Character of the Spiritist Revelation


other hand, teach what they have discovered firsthand: they are
original revelators. They contribute the light that is gradually
popularized. Where would humankind be without revelation by
the geniuses who appear from time to time!
       But what are these geniuses? Why are they geniuses? Where
do they come from? What becomes of them? Let us note that, for
the most part, they bring at birth transcendent faculties and innate
knowledge, which a little effort is sufficient to develop. They very
much belong to humankind since they are born, live and die like
the rest of us. So, from where have they derived such knowledge,
which they could not have acquired from their present existence?
Might one say, along with the materialists, that chance has given
them a greater quantity and better quality of cerebral matter? If
that were the case, they would have no more merit than a vegetable
that is larger and tastier than another.
       Might one say, along with certain spiritualists, that God
has blessed them with a soul more highly endowed than that
of ordinary individuals? That would be a completely illogical
supposition since it would accuse God of being partial. The only
rational solution to the problem lies in the preexistence of the
soul and the plurality of existences. Geniuses are spirits who
have existed longer, and who, consequently, have acquired more
and progressed further than those who are less advanced. Upon
incarnating, they bring what they know, and since they know
much more than others without having to learn it, they are called
geniuses. But what they know is none other than the fruit of
previous accomplishments and not the result of privilege. Before
birth, they were already advanced spirits; they reincarnate either
to enable others to benefit from what they know, or to acquire
further knowledge for themselves.
       Of course, human beings progress by themselves and
through the efforts of their intelligence, but left to their own


                                   19

                          Genesis - Chapter I


devices such progress is very slow if they are not helped by more-
advanced individuals, just as students are helped by their teachers.
All cultures have had their geniuses who have come at various
times to give them an impulse and draw them out of their inertia.
       6. Since we believe in God’s solicitude for God’s creatures,
why not believe that capable spirits, through their energy and the
superiority of their knowledge, enable humankind to advance,
incarnating at God’s will in order to aid progress in a particular
area; that they receive a mission much as ambassadors receive one
from their sovereign? Such is the role of great geniuses. What do
they come to do if not to teach people truths of which they are
ignorant – and of which they would perhaps remain ignorant for
a long time – in order to give them an impulse by which they
may advance more rapidly? These geniuses – appearing down
through the centuries like shining stars, leaving behind them a
long, luminous trail for humankind – are missionaries, or if you
will, messiahs. The new things they teach to humankind, whether
of a physical or of a philosophical order, are revelations.
       If God calls forth revelators to make known scientific
truths, God can, with all the more reason, call them forth to make
known moral truths, which are one of the essential elements of
progress. Such are the philosophers whose ideas have traversed
the centuries.
       7. In the special sense of religious faith, revelation applies
more particularly to spiritual matters, which humans cannot know
by themselves, and which they cannot discover by means of their
senses, the understanding of which is given to them by God or
God’s messengers, whether by direct word or inspiration. In this
case, revelation is always given to qualified individuals designated
as prophets or messiahs; that is, messengers or missionaries on a
mission to transmit revelation to humankind. Considered from this


                                  20

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


point of view, revelation implies complete passivity; it is accepted
without question, without examination, without argument.
        8. All religions have had their revelators, and although they
were far from having known the truth in its entirety, they had their
providential reason for being, because they were appropriate for the
time and environment in which they lived, and for the particular
character of the peoples to whom they spoke, and compared with
whom they were relatively more highly evolved. In spite of errors
contained in their doctrines, they nevertheless stirred up people’s
minds, thereby sowing the seeds of progress that would sprout and
grow later on, or will blossom someday under the sun of Christianity.
It is therefore erroneous to hurl anathemas at them in the name of
orthodoxy, for a day will come in which all such beliefs, so diverse in
form, but which actually rest upon the same fundamental principle –
God and the immortality of the soul – will merge into a great and
vast unity once reason will have triumphed over prejudice.
        Unfortunately, religions in all ages have been instruments
of domination; the role of prophet has stirred up secondary
ambitions, and we have seen multitudes of false revelators
or messiahs emerge, who, thanks to the prestige of the label,
have exploited people’s credulity to satisfy their pride, greed or
indolence, finding it more convenient to live at the expense of
their victims. The Christian religion itself has not been sheltered
from such parasites. In this regard, we ask that serious attention
be paid to chapter XXI of The Gospel according to Spiritism: “There
will be false christs and false prophets.”
      9. Are there direct revelations from God to humans?
That is a question we would not dare answer either affirmatively
or negatively in an absolute manner. There is nothing radically
impossible about it, but there is nothing to prove it with certainty.
What cannot be doubted, however, is that the spirits closest to


                                    21

                                     Genesis - Chapter I


God in perfection grasp God’s thought and can transmit it. As
for incarnate revelators, according to the hierarchical order3 to
which they belong and the degree of their own personal erudition,
they can draw their teaching from their own knowledge, or they
can receive it from more highly evolved spirits, and even from
messengers straight from God. The latter, speaking in God’s name,
might at times have been taken for God per se.
       These kinds of communications contain nothing strange to
whomever is familiar with spirit phenomena and the way in which
relations occur between incarnates and discarnates. Teachings may
be transmitted in several different ways: through pure and simple
inspiration, through the auditory word, or through the seeing of
instructor spirits in visions and apparitions, whether in dreams or
in the waking state, many examples of which may be seen in the
Bible, the Gospels and the sacred books of all cultures. Thus, it is
strictly precise to say that most all revelators are inspired hearing or
seeing mediums, from which, however, it does not follow that all
mediums are revelators, much less direct intermediaries from the
Divinity or its messengers.
       10. Only pure spirits receive the word of God with the
mission of transmitting it, but nowadays we know that all spirits
are far from being perfect, and that there are those who present
themselves under false appearances; this is what led St. John to
state: “Do not believe in every spirit, but first, see if the spirits are
from God.” (I Jn. 4:4)
       Hence, it is just as possible for there to be authentic and
true revelations as it is for there to be apocryphal and deceitful
ones. The fundamental character of divine revelation is that of
eternal truthfulness. Every revelation tainted with error or subject to
change cannot have emanated from God. Thus it is that the law of

    subject of the spirit hierarchy. – Tr.



                                                22

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


the Decalogue displays all the characteristics of its origin, whereas
the other Mosaic laws, essentially transitory and frequently
contradicting the law of Sinai, are the personal and political work
of the Hebrew Lawgiver. As the customs of the people tamed down,
these laws fell into disuse by themselves, whereas the Decalogue
continued to remain standing as a beacon for humankind. Christ
himself made it the foundation of his building, whereas he
abolished the other laws. If they had been the work of God, he
would not have touched them. Christ and Moses are the two great
revelators who changed the face of the world, and therein lies the
proof of their divine mission. A purely human work would not
have had such power.
       11. An important revelation is being fulfilled at the present
time: that which shows us the possibility of communicating with
the beings of the spirit world. Such knowledge is not new, of course;
however, until now it had remained more or less disregarded, that
is, without any benefit to humankind. Ignorance of the laws that
govern such relations had smothered them under superstition;
humans were incapable of deriving any sound conclusion from
them. It was reserved for our own era to disentangle them from
their nonsensical accessories, to comprehend their scope and to set
free the light that must illuminate the course of the future.
       12. By enabling us to know the invisible world, which
surrounds us and in the midst of which we live without suspecting
it, the laws that govern it, its relations with the visible world, the
nature and state of the beings who inhabit it, and, consequently,
the destiny of the human being after death, Spiritism is a true
revelation in the scientific meaning of the word.
       13. By its very nature, Spiritist revelation has a dual
character: it derives simultaneously from a divine and a scientific
revelation. It derives from the former the fact that its advent was


                                    23

                           Genesis - Chapter I


providential and not the result of the initiative and premeditated
desire of any one human being in particular; that the fundamental
points of the Doctrine come from the teachings given by the
Spirits, appointed by God to enlighten humans about matters of
which they were ignorant and could not learn by themselves, but
which they must now know, now that they are mature enough to
understand them. It derives from the latter in that such teachings
are not the privilege of any one individual, but were given to the
whole world through the same means; that those who transmit
them and those who receive them are not passive subjects excused
from the work of observation and research; that they are not called
to renounce their own reason and free will; that scrutinizing them
is not prohibited but, on the contrary, recommended; and finally,
that the Doctrine has not been dictated in its entirety nor imposed
upon a blind faith, but rather, that it is deduced through human
endeavor, from the observation of the phenomena that the Spirits
place right before our eyes, and from the teachings they give,
teachings that people can study, comment on and compare, and
from which they themselves draw conclusions and applications.
In other words, what characterizes Spiritist revelation is that its
source is divine, that its initiative belongs to the Spirits, and that its
development is the result of the work of men and women.
       14. As a means of development, Spiritism proceeds
exactly in the same way as the positive sciences; i.e., it applies the
experimental method. When phenomena of a new order occur
that cannot be explained by known laws, Spiritism observes,
compares and analyzes them, and tracing the effects back to the
causes, it arrives at the law governing them. Afterward, it deduces
their consequences and searches for their useful applications.
It establishes no preconceived theory; thus, it sets forth as a
hypothesis neither the existence or intervention of spirits, the
perispirit, reincarnation, nor any of the Doctrine’s principles.

                                   24

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


It concluded that spirits exist when such existence was deduced
from the evidence derived from observing the phenomena, and
it proceeded likewise regarding the other principles. It was not
the phenomena that came as an afterthought to confirm the
theory, but the theory that came subsequently to explain and
summarize the phenomena. Thus, it is entirely correct to state
that Spiritism is a science of observation and not a product of
the imagination. The sciences have made no serious progress
except when their studies have been based on the experimental
method. However, to this day it is believed that this method is
applicable only to matter; nonetheless, it is equally applicable to
things metaphysical.
       15. Let us cite an example. In the world of spirits a very
odd occurrence may be observed, which certainly no one would
have suspected: there are some spirits who do not believe they are
actually dead. Well then! Highly evolved spirits, who know this fact
perfectly well, did not come to say beforehand, “There are spirits
who believe they are still living the earthly life, who have retained
their tastes, habits and instincts”; rather, they caused spirits of this
category to manifest themselves so that we could observe them.
Consequently, having observed spirits who were uncertain of their
state, or who stated that they were still in this world and believed
they were attending to their normal occupations, from the example
was derived the rule. The great number of such phenomena showed
us that this was no exception, but one of the phases of spirit life. It
enabled us to study all the varieties and causes of this odd illusion,
to realize that this situation is principally characteristic of spirits
who are only slightly advanced morally, that it is peculiar to certain
kinds of death, and that it is only temporary, although it can last
for days, months or years. It was thus that the theory was born
from the observation. The same has occurred with all the other
principles of the Doctrine.

                                    25

                           Genesis - Chapter I


       16. In the same way that science per se has as its object the
study of the laws of the material principle, the special object of
Spiritism is the knowledge of the laws of the spiritual principle.
Now, since the latter is one of the forces of nature, which reacts
incessantly and reciprocally upon the material principle, it follows
that knowledge of one cannot be complete without knowledge of
the other. Spiritism and science complete each other: science without
Spiritism is completely unable to explain certain phenomena solely
by means of the laws of matter; Spiritism without science would
lack support and control. The study of the laws of matter had to
precede the study of spirituality because it is matter that first strikes
the senses. If Spiritism had come before scientific discoveries, it
would have been an aborted endeavor, like everything else that
arrives before its time.
       17. All the sciences are linked together and have succeeded
one another in a rational order; they were born one from the other
as they found a point of support in previous ideas and knowledge.
Astronomy, one of the first sciences to be cultivated, remained in
the errors of childhood until the moment when physics arrived
on the scene to reveal the law of the forces of natural agents.
Chemistry, unable to do anything without physics, had to follow
it closely so that afterward the two could proceed in agreement,
one supported by the other. Anatomy, physiology, zoology, botany
and mineralogy did not become genuine sciences except with the
help of the insights brought by physics and chemistry. Geology,
born just yesterday, without astronomy, physics, chemistry and all
the others, would have lacked its true elements of vitality; hence,
it could only have come along later.
      18. Modern science demonstrated the truth regarding
the four primitive elements of the ancients, and, observation by
observation, arrived at the concept of only one generating element


                                   26

                           Character of the Spiritist Revelation


for all the transformations of matter; however, matter per se is
inert; it has neither life, thought nor feeling; it must be joined
with the spiritual principle. Spiritism neither discovered nor
invented this principle, but it was the first to demonstrate it
through irrefutable proofs; it studied it, analyzed it and rendered
its action obvious. To the material element it added the spiritual
element. The material element and the spiritual element: these are
the two principles, the two living forces of nature. Through the
indissoluble union of these two elements one can easily explain a
multitude of phenomena unexplainable till now.4
       Having the study of one of the two constituent elements
of the universe as its object, Spiritism inevitably comes in contact
with the majority of the sciences; it could not have appeared except
after their development, and through the force of things it was
born from the impossibility of everything being explained solely
with the aid of the laws of matter.
       19. Spiritism has been accused of kinship with magic and
sorcery; however, it has been forgotten that astronomy has judicial
astrology5 as its older kin, and which is still not too far removed
from our day; that chemistry is the daughter of alchemy, which no
sensible person would dare take up nowadays. Based on this, no one
would deny that the seed of the truths from which these current
4
    The word element is not used here in the sense of a simple, elemental body, or of primitive
    molecules, but in the sense of a constituent part of a whole. In this sense, one could say
    that the spiritual element takes an active part in the economy of the universe, just as one
    says that the civil element and the military element make up a figure in the total sum of a
    population; that the religious element has bearing upon education; that in Algeria there is
    the Arab element and the European element. – Auth.

    Judicial astrology is the art of forecasting future events by calculation of the planetary and
    stellar bodies and their relationship to the Earth. The term “Judicial astrology” was mainly
    used in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance to distinguish between the type of astrology
    that was considered to be heretical by the Catholic church, versus the “natural astrology”
    such as Medical astrology and Meteorological astrology which were seen as acceptable
    because they were a part of the natural sciences of the time. Today this distinction is largely
    obsolete. (Wikipedia contributors, “Judicial astrology,” Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia,

sciences arose were to be found in astrology and alchemy. In spite of
its ridiculous formulas, alchemy showed us the simple bodies and
the law of affinities. Astrology rested on the position and movement
of the heavenly bodies it studied. However, due to ignorance of the
true laws that govern the mechanism of the universe, such heavenly
bodies were, to the common folk, mysterious beings to which
superstition loaned a moral influence and a revelatory meaning.
When Galileo, Newton and Kepler made those laws known, when
the telescope rent the veil and plunged into the depths of space – a
gaze that certain individuals found to be indiscrete – the planets
appeared to us simply as worlds similar to our own, and the entire
scaffolding of the extraordinary collapsed.
       The same has occurred with Spiritism regarding magic
and sorcery; these also rested on the manifestation of spirits,
just as astrology rested on the movement of the heavenly bodies.
However, ignorant of the laws that govern the spirit world, they
combined with these relations practices and beliefs to which
modern Spiritism, the fruit of experimentation and observation,
has put an end. Of course, the distance that separates Spiritism
from magic and sorcery is much greater than that which exists
between astronomy and astrology, and between chemistry and
alchemy; to want to confuse them is to demonstrate the fact that
one does not know the first thing about them.
        20. The sole fact of the possibility of communicating with
the beings of the spirit world has incalculable consequences of the
highest import; a whole new world has been revealed to us, one
that is all the more important because it concerns all humankind,
without exception. As it becomes more widespread, this knowledge
cannot help but bring a profound change in the customs, character,
habits and beliefs that have such a big influence on societal relations.
It is a whole revolution that operates on ideas, a revolution all the
greater and more powerful in that it is not limited to one particular

                                   28

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


culture or caste, but simultaneously reaches the heart all classes,
nationalities and religious belief systems.
       It is, therefore, with good reason that Spiritism is considered
to be the third of the great revelations. Let us see how these
revelations differ and by what bond they are linked together.
       21. MOSES, as a prophet, revealed to humans the
knowledge of one sole God, the sovereign Lord and Creator
of all things. Moses promulgated the law of Sinai and laid the
foundations of the true faith. As a man, he was the lawgiver of the
people through whom this primitive faith, after becoming more
refined, would one day spread over the entire earth.
      22. CHRIST, taking from the ancient law what was eternal
and divine and rejecting that which was only transitory, purely
disciplinary and of human conception, added the revelation of
the future life, about which Moses had not spoken: that of the
punishments and rewards that await the individual after death.
(See Revue Spirite, 1861, pp. 90, 280)
      23. The most important part of Christ’s revelation – in the
sense that it is the primary source, the cornerstone of his entire
doctrine – is the entirely new point of view by which he portrays
the Divinity. It is no longer the terrible, jealous and vengeful God
of Moses; the cruel and merciless God who drenches the earth
with human blood, who ordains the massacre and extermination
of peoples – including women, children and the elderly – and who
chastises those who spare their victims. It is no longer the unjust
God who punishes an entire people for the wrongs of their leader,
or who takes revenge on the guilty by striking the innocent, or
who castigates children for the wrongs of their father; rather, God
is one who is kind, supremely just and good, full of tenderness
and mercy, who forgives the repentant sinner and renders to each
one according to his or her deeds. It is no longer the God of a single,


                                    29

                          Genesis - Chapter I


privileged people, the God of armies, presiding over battles to
support his own cause against the gods of other peoples, but the
common Father of all humankind, who extends his protection
over all his children and calls them to his divine presence. It is
no longer the God who rewards and punishes solely through
the things of the earth, and whose glory and joy consist in the
servitude of rival peoples and in the multiplicity of progeny, but
one who says to humankind, “Your true homeland is not in this
world; it is in the heavenly kingdom; it is there that the humble
of heart will be uplifted and the proud will be abased.” It is no
longer the God who makes vengeance a virtue and who ordains
the retribution of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, but the
God of mercy who says, “Forgive others’ offenses if you yourself
want to be forgiven; do good in exchange for evil; do not do
unto others what you would not want them to do unto you.”
It is no longer the grudging and meticulous God who imposes,
under the severest penalties, the way in which he wants to be
worshiped, and who becomes offended at the non-observance of
some formula, but the great God who considers the thought and
who is not honored by the form. Finally, it is no longer the God
who wants to be feared, but the God who wants to be loved.
      24. Since God is the focal point of all religious beliefs,
the aim of all forms of worship, then the character of all religions
conforms to their idea of God. Religions that depict God as vindictive
and cruel believe they honor God through acts of cruelty, through
burnings at the stake and torture. Those that depict God as partial
and jealous are intolerant; they are in varying degrees meticulous as
to form, depending on how much they believe God to be tainted
by human weaknesses and pettiness.
      25. Christ’s entire doctrine is based on the character that
he attributed to the Divinity. With an impartial, supremely just,


                                  30

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


good and merciful God, he was able to make love for God and
charity toward one’s neighbor the express condition of salvation,
and state: Love God above all things and your neighbor as yourselves;
such is the whole law and all of the prophets, and there is no other.
Upon this belief alone, he was able to establish the principle of the
equality of individuals before God and that of universal fraternity.
But was it not possible to love the God of Moses? No, one could
only fear him.
       This revelation of the true attributes of the Divinity, together
with the immortality of the soul and the future life, profoundly
changed mutual relations among human beings, imposing new
obligations on them and enabling them to view the present life
in a different light. For that reason, it had to impact customs
and societal relations. Due to its consequences, it is incontestably
the crucial point of Christ’s revelation, one whose importance
has not been sufficiently grasped. Regrettably, it is also the point
from which we are the furthest removed and the one that we have
ignored the most in the interpretation of his teachings.
       26. However, Christ adds, “Many of the things that I am
saying to you, you cannot yet understand, and I have many other
things to tell you as well, but you would not understand them
either; that is why I speak to you in parables; later, however, I will
send you the Consoler, the Spirit of Truth, who will reestablish all
things and explain them to you.”
                                 (Jn. chaps. 14, 16; Mt. chap. 17).

      If Christ did not say all that he could have said, it was because
he believed certain truths should be left veiled until humans were
capable of comprehending them. By his own admission, his
teaching was thus incomplete, since he announced the coming
of the one who would complete it. Hence, he foresaw that we
would misinterpret his words and that we would deviate from

                                    31

                          Genesis - Chapter I


his teachings; in other words, that we would undo what he had
done, since all things would have to be reestablished; now, one only
reestablishes that which has been undone.
      27. Why did he call the new Messiah the Consoler? This
name, significant and unambiguous, is an entire revelation in itself.
He foresaw then that humans would have need of consolation,
which implies the insufficiency of the consolation they would find
in the beliefs they would formulate. Christ was never clearer or
more explicit than in these last words, of which few individuals
have been aware, perhaps because bringing them into focus and
delving into their prophetic meaning has been avoided.
       28. If Christ could not develop his teaching completely,
it was because humans lacked the knowledge they could acquire
only with time, and without which they could not comprehend
it. There are things that would have seemed nonsensical in their
state of knowledge back then. To “complete” his teaching must be
understood in the sense of explaining and developing, rather than in
the sense of adding new truths, because everything in his teaching
existed in seed form; only the key was missing for capturing the
meaning of his words.
       29. But who would dare allow themselves to interpret the
sacred Scriptures? Who has this right? Who possesses the necessary
learning, if not theologians?
       Who would dare? First of all, science would; science, which
does not have to ask for anyone’s permission to make known
the laws of nature, and which leaps with both feet together over
errors and preconceptions. Who has this right? In this century of
intellectual emancipation and freedom of conscience, the right of
examination belongs to everybody, and the Scriptures are no longer
the Holy Ark on which no one would dare to lay a finger without
the risk of being struck down. As for the need of special knowledge,


                                  32

                       Character of the Spiritist Revelation


without contesting that of theologians, and as enlightened as the
medieval theologians may have been – the Church Fathers in
particular – they were not sufficiently enlightened not to condemn
the movement of the earth and the belief in antipodes6 as heresy.
Even without going so far, have not the theologians of today hurled
their anathemas against the periods of the earth’s formation?
       People could explain the Scriptures only with the aid of what
they knew and the erroneous or incomplete notions they held
concerning the laws of nature, revealed later on by science. That
is why theologians themselves could in all good faith be mistaken
about the meaning of certain words and certain incidents in the
Gospel. Wanting at all costs to find in the Gospel the confirmation
of a preconceived idea, they continued going around in the same
circle without abandoning their point of view, so that they always
ended up seeing in it only what they wanted to see. As scholarly
as those theologians might have been, they could not comprehend
causes that depended on laws unknown to them.
       However, who will be the judge of the diverse and often
contradictory interpretations given outside of theology? The
future, logic and common sense. As people become more
enlightened to the degree that new facts and laws are revealed,
they will be able to separate utopian theories from reality. Thus,
science makes certain laws known; Spiritism makes others known;
both are indispensable for understanding the sacred texts of all
religions, from Confucianism and Buddhism to Christianity. As for
theology, it cannot judiciously allege that there are contradictions
in science, when it is not always in agreement with itself.
       30. SPIRITISM, taking its point of departure from the
very words of Christ – just as Christ drew his from Moses – is a
direct consequence of his doctrine.

    Webster’s College Dictionary, 1991). – Tr.

                          Genesis - Chapter I


       To the vague idea of the future life, Spiritism adds the
revelation of the existence of the invisible world that surrounds
us and populates space, and thereby renders belief clear; it gives it
body, consistency and reality of thought.
       Spiritism has defined the ties that unite the soul and the
body, and has lifted the veil that once hid from humans the
mysteries of birth and death.
       By means of Spiritism, men and women know where they have
come from, where they are going, why they are on the earth and why
they suffer temporarily; and they see everywhere the justice of God.
       They know that the soul progresses unceasingly through
a series of successive existences until it reaches the degree of
perfection that can bring it close to God.
       They know that all souls have the same point of departure
and are created equal, with the same aptitude for progressing in
virtue of their free will; that all are of the same essence, and that
there are no differences among them except the degree of progress
they have accomplished; that all have the same destination and
will reach the same goal more quickly or less so according to their
labor and goodwill.
       They know that there are no disinherited individuals, nor are
some more favored than others; that God has not created anyone
privileged and exempt from the efforts that have been imposed on
others for their progress; that there are no beings devoted forever
to evil and suffering; that those designated by the name demons are
spirits who are still little-evolved and imperfect, and who practice
evil in the spirit state just as they did in the corporeal state, but
who will advance and improve themselves nonetheless; that angels
or pure spirits are not beings created apart in creation, but are
spirits who reached their goal after having followed the path of
progress; that there are, therefore, neither multiple creations nor
different categories among intelligent beings, but that the whole of


                                  34

                           Character of the Spiritist Revelation


creation has resulted from the great law of unity that governs the
universe, and that all beings gravitate toward a common objective,
which is perfection, without some being favored at the expense of
the others – they are all children of their own deeds.
       31. Through the relations that humans can now establish
with those who have left the earth, they not only possess material
proof of the existence and individuality of the soul, but they
understand the solidarity that connects the living and the dead of
this world, and of those of this world with those of other worlds.
They know about the situation of the dead in the spirit world;
they can follow them on their migrations; they can witness their
joys and misfortunes; they know why they are happy or unhappy
and the fate that awaits them according to the good or evil they
have done. Such relations have initiated humans into the future
life, which they can observe in all its stages, in all its peripetias7.
The future is no longer just a vague hope: it is a positive fact, a
mathematical certainty. Thus, death holds nothing to be feared,
because it is deliverance, the door to the true life.
       32. By studying the situation of spirits, humans know that
happiness or unhappiness in the spirit life is inherent to their
degree of perfection or imperfection; that each spirit suffers the
direct and natural consequences of its wrongs; in other words, that
it is punished wherein it has sinned; that such consequences last
as long as the causes that produced them; that the guilty would,
therefore, suffer forever if they were to persist forever in evil, but
that their suffering ceases with repentance and reparation. Thus,
since it depends on all to improve themselves, they each can, by
virtue of their free will, prolong or shorten their sufferings, just as
those who are ill suffer from their excesses as long as they do not
put an end to them.

                           Genesis - Chapter I


       33. If reason rejects as incompatible with the goodness of
God the idea of unforgivable, eternal, and absolute punishment –
frequently inflicted for a single wrong – and the torments of hell that
cannot be lessened even by the most ardent and sincere repentance,
the same reason bows down before that distributive and impartial
justice that takes everything into account, never closes the door to
repentance and unceasingly extends its hand to those who have
fallen overboard instead of pushing them into the deep.
       34. The plurality of existences, whose principle Christ
established in the Gospel, but without defining it more than many
others, is one of the most important laws revealed by Spiritism, in
the sense that it demonstrates the reality and necessity of progress.
Through this law, humans can explain all the apparent anomalies
that life presents: differences in social position; premature deaths,
which, without reincarnation, would render a shortened life useless
to the soul; and the inequality of intellectual and moral aptitudes
due to the age of the spirit, who has learned and progressed to a
greater or lesser extent, and who, upon being reborn, brings with
it what it had acquired in its former lives. (See no. 5).
       35. With the doctrine of the creation of each soul at birth,
one falls again into the theory of privileged creations; individuals are
strangers to one another, nothing connects them, and family ties are
purely physical; family members are not linked together by a past
in which they did not exist. With the doctrine of nothingness after
death, all their relationships cease with life; they have no commonality
in the future. However, through reincarnation, they are in solidarity
regarding both the past and the future; their relationships continue
both in the spirit and corporeal worlds; fraternity is based on the very
laws of nature; good has an objective; evil, its inevitable consequences.
      36. With reincarnation, race and caste prejudices collapse,
since the same spirit can be reborn rich or poor, great lord or


                                   36

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


proletarian, boss or subordinate, free or slave, male or female. Of
all the arguments against the injustice of servitude and slavery,
against the subjugation of women to the law of the mightiest,
there are none that logically prevail over the material fact of
reincarnation. Therefore, if reincarnation rests upon a law of
nature – the principle of universal fraternity – it also rests upon
the law of the equality of social rights and, consequently, of liberty.
       37. Take away humans’ free and independent spirit that
survives matter and you will turn them into organized machines,
without purpose or responsibilities, without any other restraint
than criminal law, and suitable for being exploited like intelligent
animals. Expecting nothing after death, nothing would stop them
from adding to the pleasures of the present; if they suffer, they have
no other prospect than despair and nothingness as a refuge. On
the other hand, with the certainty of the future, that of meeting
once again those whom they have loved, as well as the fear of seeing
once again those whom they have offended, all their ideas change. If
Spiritism had done nothing except free humans from their doubt
regarding the future life, it would have done more for their moral
advancement than all the disciplinary laws that sometimes restrain
them but never change them.
       38. Without the preexistence of the soul, the doctrine of
original sin – a doctrine that renders all individuals responsible for
the sin of only one of them – is not only irreconcilable with the
justice of God, but would be senseless and all the more unjustifiable,
according to this doctrine, because the soul did not even exist at
the time that its responsibility is claimed to have arisen. With
preexistence, humans bring at birth the seed of their imperfections
and the defects they have not yet corrected, and which are expressed
through their innate instincts and their propensities toward this or
that vice. This is their true original sin, whose consequences they


                                    37

                           Genesis - Chapter I


naturally suffer, but with the crucial difference that they undergo
punishment for their own wrongs only and not those of someone
else. And there is yet another difference – at once consoling,
heartening, and supremely equitable: each existence offers them
the means to redeem themselves through reparation and to progress
further whether by ridding themselves of a few imperfections or by
acquiring new knowledge to the point where they are sufficiently
purified so as to have no more need of corporeal life, but can live
exclusively the spirit life, eternal and blissful.
       For the same reason, those who have progressed morally
bring innate qualities upon being reborn, just as those who have
progressed intellectually bring innate ideas; they identify with
the good; they practice it without effort or calculation, and, so to
speak, without even thinking about it. Those who are obligated to
combat their evil tendencies are still in the struggle: the former have
already defeated them; the latter are on the way to defeating them.
Thus, there is original virtue, just as there is original knowledge and
sin, or better yet, original vice.
       39. Experimental Spiritism has studied the properties of the
spiritual fluids and their actions upon matter. It has demonstrated the
existence of the perispirit, suspected since antiquity and designated
by St. Paul by the name spiritual body, that is, the fluidic body of
the soul after the destruction of the tangible body. We know today
that this envelope is inseparable from the soul; that it is one of the
constituent elements of the human being; that it is the vehicle for the
transmission of thought, and that during corporeal life it serves as the
connection between the spirit and matter. The perispirit plays a role
so important in the organism and in a number of ailments that it is
connected to the physiological as well as the psychological makeup.
       40. The study of the properties of the perispirit, the
spiritual fluids and the physiological attributes of the soul opens


                                   38

                  Character of the Spiritist Revelation


up new horizons to science and provides the key to a number of
phenomena incomprehensible until now for lack of knowledge
of the law governing them; phenomena denied by materialism
for being connected to spiritual matters and qualified by others
as either miracles or sorcery, depending on their belief system.
Such phenomena are, among others, second sight, at-distance
vision, natural and induced somnambulism, the psychic
effects of catalepsy and lethargy, prescience, presentiments,
apparitions, transfigurations, transmission of thought, fascination,
instantaneous healings, obsessions and possessions, etc. By
demonstrating that these phenomena rest on laws that are as
natural as those of electrical phenomena, and by demonstrating
the normal conditions in which they can be reproduced, Spiritism
has destroyed the empire of the extraordinary and supernatural,
and consequently, the source of most superstitions. If it leads to
the belief in the possibility of certain things regarded by some as
chimerical, it impedes the belief in many others, which it shows to
be impossible and irrational.
       41. Far from denying or doing away with the Gospel,
Spiritism has come instead to confirm, explain and develop, by
means of the new laws of nature that it reveals, everything that
Christ said and did; it sheds light on the obscure points of his
teachings in such a way that those to whom certain parts of
the Gospel had been unintelligible or had seemed unacceptable
understand them effortlessly and thereby accept them. They
comprehend the Gospel’s scope better and can separate reality
from allegory; Christ seems greater to them: he is no longer simply
a philosopher; he is a divine Messiah.
       42. Furthermore, if we appraise the moralizing power of
Spiritism by the purpose that it assigns to all the actions of life;
by the consequences of good and evil that it makes tangible;


                                   39

                                        Genesis - Chapter I


by the moral strength, courage and consolation it offers in
affliction through an unshakable confidence in the future; by
the thought of having near to us those whom we have loved, the
assurance of seeing them again, and the possibility of conversing
with them; and, finally, by the certainty that, of everything that
is done, everything that is acquired in intelligence, science and
morality – right up to the last hour of one’s life – nothing is lost
and that everything is useful for one’s advancement, then one
realizes that Spiritism fulfills all the promises of Christ regarding
the foretold Consoler. Thus, since it is the Spirit of Truth who
presides over the great movement of regeneration, the promise
of its coming is thus found to have been fulfilled, because, in
fact, it is the true Consoler.8
       43. If to these results is added the unheard-of speed of the
spread of Spiritism in spite of everything that has been done to
bring it down, one cannot deny that its coming was providential,
for it is triumphing over all human forces and ill-will. The ease
with which it is being accepted without constraint by such a
large number, with no other means except the power of the idea,
proves that it responds to a need to believe in something after

    Many parents deplore the premature death of their children, for whose education they
    have made great sacrifices, and they say to themselves that everything has been for
    naught. However, with Spiritism they no longer regret such sacrifices, and will be ready to
    make them, even with the certainty of seeing their children die, because they know that if
    these children cannot use their education in their present life, it will first of all serve for their
    progress as spirits; that it will be a further acquisition for a new existence, and that when
    they return to this world, they will possess an intellectual aptitude that will make them
    more capable of acquiring new knowledge. Such are the children who bring innate ideas
    with them at birth, who know, so to speak, without having to learn. If these parents do
    not have the immediate satisfaction of seeing their children benefit from this education,
    they certainly will have such satisfaction later, either as spirits or as human beings. Perhaps
    they will once again be the parents of these same children, described as having been
    fortunately gifted by nature, but who really owe their abilities to a previous education.
    The same applies if children become evil as a result of their parents’ negligence, as the
    parents may have to suffer later for the troubles and sorrows that such children will bring
    upon them in a new existence (See The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. 5, no. 21,
    Premature Deaths). – Auth.

the emptiness dug out by disbelief, and that, consequently, its
time has come.
       44. The afflicted are great in number; it is not surprising,
therefore, that so many individuals welcome a doctrine that
consoles instead of doctrines that dishearten, because it is to the
disinherited more than to the fortunate of the world that Spiritism
is directed. The sick see the coming of the doctor with greater joy
than those who are well; in such case, the afflicted are the ill and
the Consoler is the doctor.
       You, who fight against Spiritism, if you want us to abandon
it and follow you, then give us something that is greater and better;
that heals with greater assurance the wounds of the soul; that gives
more consolation, more satisfaction to the heart, more authentic
hopes and greater certainties; that shows a more rational and
more alluring picture of the future. Do not think, however, about
prevailing over it, you, with your perspective of nothingness, or
you who offer a choice between the flames of hell and beatific and
useless eternal contemplation.
       45. The first revelation was personified in Moses, the
second in Christ; the third is not personified in any one individual.
The first two were individual; the third is collective – an essential
character of great importance. It is collective in the sense that
it was not given as a privilege to any one person in particular;
consequently, no one can claim to be its exclusive prophet. It has
been given simultaneously all over the earth to millions of people
of all ages and social standing, from the lowest to the highest on
the scale, according to this prediction referred to by the author of
The Acts of the Apostles: “In the latter days,” says the Lord, “I will
pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and daughters shall
prophesy; your young men shall have visions and your old men
shall have dreams” (Acts 2:17,18). The third revelation did not


                                    41

                                     Genesis - Chapter I


arise from any special belief system so that it could serve one day
as a rallying point for all.9
       46. The first two revelations, as the product of a personal
teaching, were necessarily localized; that is, they occurred in only
one place, from which the idea spread little by little. But they
required many centuries to reach the ends of the world, and even
then they did not encompass it entirely. The third revelation has
this particularity: by not being personified in one individual, it is
being produced simultaneously in thousands of different places,
all becoming centers or focal points of radiation. As these centers
multiply, their rays meet up with one another little by little, like
the circles formed by a large number of stones thrown into the
water, and in such a way that in a given amount of time they end
up covering the entire surface of the globe.
       Such is one of the causes for the rapid spread of the Doctrine.
If it had arisen in only one place, if it had been the exclusive work
of one person, a sect would have formed around him or her;
perhaps half a century might pass before it could reach the borders
of the country in which it was born, whereas, after only ten years,
Spiritism already has landmarks planted from one pole to the other.

9
    Our personal role in the grand movement of ideas being prepared by Spiritism, and which
    have begun to take effect, is that of an attentive observer who studies the phenomena
    in order to discover their cause and deduce their consequences. We have confronted
    everything that has been possible for us to gather; we compared and commented on the
    teachings given by the Spirits at all points of the globe, and afterward we methodically
    coordinated the whole; in other words, we have studied and have given to the public
    the fruit of our research without attributing to our work any other worth than that of a
    philosophical work deduced from observation and experience, without ever posing as
    the head of a doctrine, nor having wanted to impose our ideas on anyone. In publishing
    them, we have used a common right, and those who have accepted them have done so
    freely. If these ideas have found numerous sympathizers it is because they have had the
    advantage of responding to the yearnings of a large number of individuals, something
    that does not flatter our vanity, since the origin does not belong to us. Our greatest merit
    is that of the perseverance and dedication to the cause that we have embraced. In all this,
    we have done what anyone else could have done as well; that is why we have never had
    the pretension of believing ourselves to be a prophet or messiah, much less presenting
    ourselves as such. – Auth.



                                               42

        47. This situation, unheard of in the history of doctrines,
has provided it with an exceptional force and an irresistible power
of action; in fact, even if it were repressed in one place in one
country, it would be materially impossible to repress it in all places
in all countries. For every one place where it may be prohibited,
there will be a thousand others where it will flourish. What is more,
even if it might be stifled in an individual person, the same could
not be done with spirits, its source. Therefore, since spirits are
everywhere and will always exist, if by some impossible chance it
could be suppressed all over the globe, it would reappear sometime
thereafter because it rests on a fact, and this fact lies within nature
itself and the laws of nature cannot be suppressed. This is what
should dissuade those who dream of the demise of Spiritism. (See
Revue Spirite, February, 1865, p. 38: Perpétuité du Spiritism).
       48. Nevertheless, these scattered centers might still remain
isolated from one another for a long time, confined as some of
them are in far-off countries. Among these there would have to
be a uniting link that would put them in communion of thought
with their brothers and sisters in the faith in order to inform them
about what was happening elsewhere. This uniting link, which
Spiritism used to lack, can be found today in the publications which
circulate far and wide, and which condense in one single, concise
and methodical approach the teachings provided everywhere
under multiple forms and in many languages.
       49. The first two revelations could only have been the result
of a direct teaching; since humans were not yet sufficiently advanced
to aid in these revelations’ development, they had to be imposed on
people’s beliefs through the authority of the Master’s word.
       However, we should make note of the fact that they
contained a highly perceptible nuance in connection with the
progress of customs and ideas, although they were given to the


                                    43

                          Genesis - Chapter I


same people and in the same environment, although after an
interval of eighteen centuries. The doctrine of Moses is absolute,
despotic; it accepts no argument and is imposed on all the people
through force. That of Jesus is essentially one of counseling; it is
accepted freely and imposes itself only through persuasion; it was
controversial even during the time of its founder, who did not
hesitate to debate his adversaries.
       50. The third revelation, appearing at a time of intellectual
emancipation and maturity, wherein the developed mind cannot
settle itself into a passive role, and wherein people accept nothing
blindly, but want to see where they are being led and to know
the why and how of each thing, had to be at the same time the
product of a teaching and the fruit of work, research and free
examination. The Spirits teach only what is needed to place humans
on the path of truth, but they abstain from revealing what humans
can discover by themselves, allowing them the right to discuss, verify
and submit everything to the crucible of reason, even leaving
them many times to acquire experience at their own expense. The
Spirits have furnished them with the principle and materials; it is
their responsibility to take advantage of them and put them into
practice. (See no. 15)
       51. Since the elements of the Spiritist revelation have
been given simultaneously in a multitude of places to persons of
all social conditions and various degrees of education, it is quite
obvious that observations could not have been made everywhere
with the same outcome, and that the consequences derived
from them, the deductions of the laws that govern that order of
phenomena, in a word, the conclusion that would establish the
ideas, could be derived only from the whole and from a correlation
of the facts. Hence, each isolated center, limited to a narrow circle
and often observing only a particular order of phenomena, at


                                  44

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


times contradictory in appearance because they had to do with
only one category of spirits, and furthermore, being hindered by
local influences and sectarianism, found itself running up against
the material impossibility of encompassing the whole, and, for this
very reason, powerless to combine the isolated observations into a
common principle. With each person judging the facts from the
point of view of his or her own knowledge and former beliefs,
or from the particular opinion of the spirits who manifested
themselves, there would very soon have been as many theories and
systems as there were centers, and all would be incomplete for
lack of elements for comparison and control. In sum, each person
would be paralyzed by his or her own partial revelation, believing
that he or she had the whole truth, not knowing that in a hundred
other places more and better information had been obtained.
       52. Furthermore, it should be noted that no part of the
Spiritist teaching has been given in its entirety; it touches upon
such a large number of observations and such diverse subjects that
require either specialized knowledge or mediumistic abilities that
it would have been impossible to bring all the necessary conditions
together in one place. Since the teachings had to be collective and
not individual, the Spirits divided up the work, disseminating the
subjects of study and observation as is done in certain factories
where the production of each part of the same object is divided up
among different workers.
       Thus, the revelation was given partially, in several places and
through a multitude of intermediaries, and it is in this manner
that it continues to progress at this time, for not everything has yet
been revealed. Each center finds in others a supplement for what
it has obtained, and it is this collection, the coordination of all the
partial teachings, that comprises the Spiritist Doctrine.
       It was therefore necessary to group the scattered facts in order
to understand their correlation, and to collect the diverse documents

                                    45

                                     Genesis - Chapter I


and teachings given by the Spirits regarding all points and subjects in
order to compare, analyze and study their similarities and differences.
Since communications are given by spirits of all the hierarchical
orders – some more enlightened than others – it would be necessary
to analyze the degree of trust that reason would allow to be given to
them; to distinguish the individual and isolated theoretical ideas from
those that had the sanction of the overall teaching of the Spirits, and
the utopian ideas from the practical ones; to prune those that were
obviously refuted by data arising from positive science and sound
logic; and to utilize the errors and the information furnished by
spirits (even those of the lowest category) for an understanding of the
state of the invisible world, thereby forming a homogenous whole.
In other words, a center for development was necessary, independent
of any preconceived idea, of any sectarian prejudice, and resolved to
accept the truth that had become self-evident, even if it were contrary to
personal opinion. Such a center formed by itself through the force of
things and without premeditated intent.10

10
     The Spirits’ Book, the first work that enabled Spiritism to enter the philosophical path
     through the deduction of the moral implications of the phenomena, and which addressed
     all the parts of the doctrine by touching upon the most important questions that it
     raised, has been, since its appearance, the rallying point to which the individual works
     spontaneously converged. It is noteworthy that from the publication of that book dates
     the era of Spiritist philosophy, a philosophy that until then had remained in the domain
     of curious experiences. If that book has won the sympathy of the majority, it is because it
     is the expression of their sentiments and responds to their aspirations; it is also because
     each one has found therein the confirmation and rational explanation of what he or she
     had obtained individually. If it were in disagreement with the overall teachings of the
     Spirits, it would not have had any credibility and would have quickly fallen into oblivion.
     So, to whom have we converged? Certainly not to any one human being in particular, who
     is nothing by him or herself, but a mainspring that dies and disappears, but to the idea,
     which does not perish because it emanates from a source higher than a human one.
     That spontaneous concentration of scattered forces has given way to an immense
     correspondence, a unique monument in the world, a living picture of the true history of
     modern Spiritism, where at the same time are reflected the partial works, the multiple
     sentiments that gave birth to the Doctrine, the moral results, the devotedness and
     the failures – precious archives for posterity, which will be able to judge individuals and
     things based on authentic records. In the presence of such irrefutable evidence, what
     will subsequently become of all the false allegations and defamations out of envy and
     jealousy? – Auth.



                                               46

                            Character of the Spiritist Revelation


       53. From this state of affairs a double current of ideas
resulted: some moving from the perimeter toward the center,
others from the center toward the perimeter. This is how the
doctrine progressed rapidly toward unity in spite of the diversity
of the sources from which it emanated, and how the divergent
theories fell little by little due to their isolation, and due to the
ascendancy of the opinion of the majority, in which they did
not find a sympathetic echo. A communion of ideas has thus
been established among the different centers. Speaking the same
spiritual language, they understand one another and sympathize
with one another from one end of the world to the other.
       Spiritists were much stronger and struggled with more
courage; they progressed with a surer step when they found
themselves no longer isolated, and when they sensed a point
of support, a tie that linked them to the larger family. The
phenomena they witnessed no longer seemed peculiar, abnormal
or contradictory to them, once they were able to connect them to
the general laws of harmony, embracing the edifice in one glance
and seeing a great and humanitarian aim in the entire whole.11

11
     A significant testimony – as noteworthy as it is touching – to this communion of thought
     that has been established among Spiritists through the conformity of their beliefs are
     the prayer requests that have come to us from the most distant countries, from Peru to
     the ends of Asia on the part of people of different religions and nationalities, and whom
     we have never even seen. Is this not the prelude to the great unification that is being
     prepared? Is it not proof that Spiritism is extending its vigorous roots far and wide? – Auth.
     It is remarkable that, of all the groups that have formed with the premeditated intention of
     creating a schism by proclaiming divergent principles – just like those, who, due to reasons
     of self-centeredness or others, do not want to appear subject to the common law, but
     regard themselves strong enough to proceed alone with enough knowledge to dispense
     with any guidance – none has arrived at constructing an idea that is preponderant and
     viable. All have become extinct or vegetated in obscurity. How could it be otherwise,
     since, in order to distinguish themselves, instead of making an effort to provide a greater
     amount of satisfaction, they rejected precisely those principles of the Doctrine that were
     the most powerfully attractive, the most consoling, the most encouraging and the most
     rational? If they had understood the power of the moral elements that comprised its
     unity, they would not have been deluded by a chimerical illusion. But taking their little
     circle to be the whole universe, they did not see in the Doctrine’s adherents more than a
     clique that could easily be overthrown by a rival one. They were strangely mistaken about



                                                 47

                                  Genesis - Chapter I


       However, how can one know if a principle is taught
universally, or if it is only the result of a personal opinion? Since
isolated groups were in no position to know what was being said
elsewhere, it was necessary for one center to bring together all the
teachings in order to do a kind of scrutiny of views and to take the
opinion of the majority to everyone else.12
       54. There is no science which, in all its parts, has come from
the mind of one sole human being. All, without exception, are
products of successive observations that find support in previous
ones, leaning on one known point to arrive at an unknown one.
That is how the Spirits have proceeded with Spiritism; that is
why their teaching has been gradual. They address issues only
in proportion and to the extent that the principles upon which
such issues must be based have been sufficiently developed,
and analysis has matured enough to assimilate them. It is quite
significant that every time individual centers have tried to address
issues prematurely, they have obtained only contradictory and
inconclusive answers. On the other hand, when the favorable
moment has arrived, the teaching generalizes and becomes unified
in almost all of the centers.
       Between the progression of Spiritism and that of the sciences
there is a crucial difference, however: the latter reached the point to
which they have arrived only after a long stretch of time, whereas
only a few years have been sufficient for Spiritism, if not to reach
 the essential characteristics of the Doctrine, and that mistake could lead to nothing but
 disappointment. Instead of destroying its unity, they broke the only connection that could
 give them power and life. (See: Revue Spirite, Apr. 1866, pp. 106, 111: Le Spiritisme sans les
 Esprits; le Spiritisme indépendant). – Auth.
 1 Such is the object of our publications, which may be regarded as the result of this
 scrutiny. All the opinions are discussed therein, but the issues are enunciated as principles
 only after having received the consecration of all the tests, the sole means that could give
 them the force of law and allow affirmation. That is why we do not lightly advocate any
 theory beforehand, and it is in that fact that the Doctrine, proceeding from the overall
 teaching, is not the product of any preconceived theory. It is also what creates its power
 and ensures its future. – Auth.

the peak, at least to collect a number of observations large enough
to constitute a doctrine. This is due to the incalculable multitude
of spirits who, by God’s will, have manifested simultaneously,
each one bringing the contingent of its own knowledge. The
result of this was that, instead of being developed successively over
many centuries, all the parts of the doctrine were formed almost
simultaneously in a matter of a few years, which was sufficient to
group them and form a whole.
       God has willed it to be so; first, so that the building could
more rapidly be built up to the top; second, so that it could, by
means of comparison, have an immediate and permanent control,
so to speak, in the universality of the teaching, each part having
worth or authority only by its connection with the whole, each
part harmonized with every other part, each finding its place in the
general order, and each arriving at the right time.
       By not entrusting to only a single spirit the task of
promulgating the doctrine, God has also willed that the least as
much as the greatest among spirits, as well as humans, bring their
stone to the building in order to establish amongst themselves a
bond of cooperative solidarity that was lacking in all the other
doctrines arising from one single source.
       On the other hand, since each spirit, just like each human
being, has only a limited amount of knowledge, individually they
were unable to address ex-professo the innumerable issues touched
upon by Spiritism. This is also why that, in order to fulfill the
Creator’s designs, the Doctrine could not be the work of only
one spirit or of only one medium. It could emerge only from a
collection of works, all controlled by one another.13
     55. One final characteristic of the Spiritist revelation, and
which proceeds from the very conditions in which it is produced,
13
     See The Gospel according to Spiritism, “Introduction”; Revue Spirite, Apr., 1864, p. 90:
     “Autorité de la Doctrine Spirite; contrôle universel de l’enseignement des Esprits.” – Auth.

is that, being supported by facts, it cannot help but be essentially
progressive like all the sciences of observation. By its essence, it
is allied with science, which, being the exposition of the laws of
nature through a certain order of facts, cannot be contrary to the
will of God, the author of such laws. The discoveries of science glorify
God rather than demean God. They destroy only what humans have
built upon their erroneous ideas about God.
        Therefore, Spiritism establishes as an absolute principle only
what has been demonstrated by the evidence, or what has arisen
logically from observation. Touching on all branches of social
economics, to which it lends the support of its own discoveries, it
will continue to assimilate all other progressive doctrines of whatever
order they may be, which have reached the status of practical truths
and which have exited the domain of utopia; otherwise, it would
be committing suicide. Ceasing to be what it truly is, it would
belie its origin and its providential purpose. Pressing forward with
progress, Spiritism will never be surpassed, because if new discoveries
were to show it to be in error on one point, it would modify itself on
that point. If a new truth is revealed, it accepts it.14
       56. Of what use is the moral doctrine of the Spirits, since
it is none other than that of Christ himself? Do humans even
have need of a revelation? Can they not find within themselves
everything that is necessary for self-guidance?
       From the moral point of view, God has without a doubt
provided humans with a guide in their conscience, which says:
“Do not do unto others what you would not want them to do
unto you.” Natural morality is certainly written in people’s hearts,

14
     Faced with such clear and categorical statements as those contained in this chapter, all
     allegations leaning toward absolutism and autocracy of principles fall apart, as well as all
     the erroneous statements that some forewarned or misinformed individuals have lent to
     the doctrine. Such statements, however, are not new. We have repeated them sufficiently
     in our writings so as not to leave any doubt in this regard. Furthermore, they point to our
     true role, the only one to which we aspire: that of a worker. – Auth.



                                                50

but does everyone know how to read it? Have they never failed to
recognize its wise precepts? What have they done with the morality
of Christ? How do those who teach it practice it? Has it not become
a dead letter, a pretty theory that is good for others but not for
themselves? Would you criticize a father for repeating the same
lessons to his children ten times or a hundred times if they did not
profit from them? Why would God do any less than such a father?
Why would God not from time to time send special messengers
to humans, entrusted with reminding them of their duties and
leading them back onto the right path when they wander from
it, and opening the eyes of intelligence for those who have closed
them, just as more advanced cultures send missionaries to those
that are less evolved?
       The Spirits teach no other morality than that of Christ for
the simple reason that there is no other that is better. But what
use would their teachings be if they told us only what we already
knew? The same might be said of Christ’s morality, which had
been taught by Socrates and Plato five-hundred years earlier and in
almost identical terms; and of all moralists who have repeated the
same thing in all sorts of tones and under all sorts of forms. Very
well! The Spirits have come simply to increase the number of moralists,
but with the difference that, manifesting themselves far and wide,
they make themselves heard in the hut as well as in the palace, by
the uneducated as well as the educated.
       What the teaching of the spirits has added to the morality
of Christ is the knowledge of the principles that link the dead
and the living, principles that complete the vague notions he
gave regarding the soul’s past and future, and which sanction
his Doctrine with the laws of nature itself. With the help of
the new insights brought by Spiritism and the Spirits, human
beings comprehend the solidarity that connects all beings;
charity and fraternity become a social necessity; they do because


                                    51

                          Genesis - Chapter I


of conviction what they would otherwise do only because of
duty – and they do it better.
       When humans practice the morality of Christ, only then
will they be able to say that they no longer have need of incarnate
or discarnate moralists; then, God will not send them any more.
       57. One of the most important questions among those
set forth at the beginning of this chapter was this: What is the
authority of the Spiritist revelation, since it emanates from beings
whose understanding is limited and who are not infallible?
       This would be a serious objection if the revelation consisted
only of the teaching of the Spirits, if we had received it from them
exclusively and had accepted it with closed eyes; the objection
becomes pointless, however, from the moment humans add
the concourse of their intelligence and reasoning. Moreover,
the Spirits limit themselves to placing humans on the path of
deductions that they can derive from observing the phenomena.
Now, the manifestations and all their innumerable variations are
facts. Humans study them and look for the law in them, and they
are aided in that endeavor by all categories of spirits, who are
collaborators rather than revelators in the usual meaning of the word.
They submit spirits’ statements to the test of logic and common
sense; in this way, they benefit from the special knowledge that
spirits offer according to their position, but without renouncing
the use of their own reason.
       Since spirits are none other than the souls of human
beings, in communicating with them we do not leave the sphere
of humanity – a crucial fact to be considered. Hence, persons of
genius, who have been the beacons of humankind, thus came
from the world of spirits just as they reentered it upon leaving
the earth behind. Since spirits can communicate with human
beings, these same geniuses can provide teachings while in spirit
form just as they did while in corporeal form. They can instruct

                                  52

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


us after their death just as they did while alive; they are invisible
instead of visible – that is the entire difference. Their experience
and knowledge must be no less, and if their words as humans had
authority, such authority should be no less simply because they are
now in the world of spirits.
       58. However, it is not only high order spirits who manifest,
but those of all orders, and such has been necessary in order to
initiate us into the true character of the spirit world, showing it to
us in all its aspects. In this way, the relations between the visible
and invisible worlds are more intimate, and their connection more
obvious. We see more clearly where we have come from and where
we are going – that is the essential purpose of the communications.
All spirits, therefore, regardless of the degree they have reached,
can teach us something; but since they are at different degrees of
enlightenment, it falls to us to discern what is good or bad in them,
and to profit from what their teachings entail. All of them, whoever
they may be, can teach us or reveal things of which we are ignorant,
and of which, without them, we would know nothing at all.
       59. The great incarnate spirits were unquestionably
powerful individuals, but their actions were restricted and
necessarily slow to spread. If only one from amongst them – even
if it were Moses or Elijah, Socrates or Plato – were to come in these
latter times to reveal to humans the state of the spirit world, who
could prove the truth of their assertions in this age of skepticism?
Would he or she not be regarded as a dreamer or utopist? And
even admitting that he or she had the absolute truth, centuries
would have to elapse before his or her ideas were accepted by the
masses. Wisely, God did not will it to be so; God willed that the
teaching be given by spirits themselves and not by incarnates in
order to convince humans of their existence, and, furthermore, to
enable it to take place simultaneously all over the earth, either so


                                    53

                          Genesis - Chapter I


that it could spread more rapidly or so that we could find in the
correlation of the teachings evidence of the truth, thus giving each
person the means of being convinced by him or herself.
       60. The Spirits did not come to free human beings from
the endeavor of study and research. They did not bring them
some kind of ready-made science. Concerning what humans could
discover for themselves, the Spirits left them to their own efforts.
This is something Spiritists know perfectly well today. For a long
time now, experience has demonstrated the error of the opinion
that attributes to spirits all knowledge and wisdom, and that it is
enough to address the first spirit who comes along in order to know
all things. Having departed earthly humanity, spirits are one of its
facets nevertheless, and, as on earth, there are those who are more
evolved and those who are commonplace. Thus, many of them
know less scientifically and philosophically than certain human
beings; they tell what they know – no more, no less. As is the case
among humans, the more advanced spirits can instruct us on more
subjects and can provide us more judicious counsel than those
who are less advanced. Asking for counsel from spirits does not entail
addressing supernatural powers, but rather one’s equals, the same ones
whom we would address if they were alive: family members, friends,
or individuals more enlightened than us. This is what is important
to comprehend and it is what is ignored by those who, not having
studied Spiritism, have a completely erroneous idea about the
nature of the spirit world and the relations with the beyond.
       61. So then, what is the usefulness of such manifestations,
or if we would prefer, such revelations, if spirits do not know any
more than we do, or if they do not tell us everything they do know?
       First, as we have already stated, they abstain from giving
us what we could acquire through our own efforts; second, there
are things they are not allowed to reveal because our degree of


                                  54

                  Character of the Spiritist Revelation


advancement cannot bear them. However, that fact aside, the
conditions of their new existence expand the circle of their
perceptions; they can see what they could not on earth. Freed from
the shackles of matter and delivered from the cares of corporeal
life, they judge things from a more elevated point of view, and,
therefore, more sanely. Their perception embraces a vaster horizon;
they comprehend their errors, rectify their ideas and rid themselves
of human prejudices.
        It is in that fact that the superiority of spirits over
corporeal humanity consists, and, depending on their degree of
advancement, the reason why their counsels may be more judicious
and disinterested than those of incarnates. Moreover, their
environment enables them to initiate us into matters regarding
the future life unbeknownst to us, which we cannot ascertain from
our current environment. Until now, humans had formulated only
theories about their future, which is why their beliefs on this point
have been divided into such numerous and divergent theories,
from nihilism to the fanciful concepts of heaven and hell. Today,
however, it is the eyewitnesses, the very actors in the life beyond
the grave, who have come to tell us what it really is – only they may
do so. Consequently, their manifestations have served to enable us
to understand the unseen world which surrounds us, and which
we did not even suspect. This understanding alone would be of
major importance, in the event we were to believe that spirits were
incapable of teaching us anything else.
        If you were to go to a country that was new to you, would
you disregard the information given to you by the humblest
peasants you came across? Would you refuse to ask them about the
state of the roads just because they are only peasants? Obviously,
you would not expect to obtain from them information of a higher
order, but because of where they are they could inform you better
on some points than could learned persons who did not know the


                                   55

                           Genesis - Chapter I


country at all. You could draw conclusions from this information
that they themselves could not, but they would have been a
useful instrument for your observations nonetheless, even if only
to inform you about the customs of peasants. The same applies
concerning our relations with spirits, where even the least of them
may teach us something, at least.
       62. A crude comparison will render the situation even more
understandable:
       A ship loaded with emigrants departs for a far-off destination.
It carries people from all walks of life, relatives and friends of those
who remain behind. It is heard that the ship has wrecked. Not a
trace of it remains and no news whatsoever has arrived regarding
its fate. It is thought that all the travelers have perished, and all
their families mourn for them. Nevertheless, everyone on board
the ship – without exception – has reached an abundant and fertile
unknown land, where they all live happily under a pleasant sky.
However, this fact is unknown. One day, another ship docks at the
same land and finds all the castaways safe and sound. The happy
news spreads like lightning. Everyone exclaims, “Our friends aren’t
lost after all!” And they render thanks to God. They cannot see
one another but they can correspond. They exchange testimonies
of affection; thus, happiness follows upon sadness.
       Such is the image of earthly life and life beyond the grave,
before and after the modern revelation. Like the second ship, it
has brought us the good news of the survival of those who are our
loved ones, and the certainty of meeting them again someday. The
doubt about their fate or ours no longer exists. Despair disappears
before hope.
       However, other results have come to enrich this revelation.
Deeming humankind mature enough to grasp the mystery of its
destiny and serenely contemplate new wonders, God has allowed
the lifting of the veil that had separated the invisible from the

                                   56

                   Character of the Spiritist Revelation


visible world. The phenomena involving the manifestations have
nothing extra-human about them. Spirit humanity has come to
converse with corporeal humanity and say:
       “We exist, so nothingness does not exist; this is what we are,
and this is what you will be; the future is for you as it is for us.
You used to walk in darkness; we have come to illumine your path
and to clear the way; you used to roam aimlessly; we will show
you the goal. Terrestrial life used to be everything to you because
you saw nothing beyond it; we have come to tell you, by showing
you the spirit life: earthly life is nothing. Your vision used to stop
at the grave; we have come to show you the splendorous horizon
beyond it. Formerly, you did not know why you suffer on earth;
now, in suffering, you see the justice of God. Doing good used
to seem to bear no fruit for the future, whereas from now on it
will have a purpose and will be a necessity. Fraternity used to be
nothing more than a fine theory; now it rests upon a law of nature.
Under the dominion of the belief that everything ends with life,
the immensity of space is empty; selfishness reigns supreme among
you and your word of order is: ‘Every man for himself.’ With the
certainty of the future, infinite space is infinitely populated; there
is neither emptiness nor solitude anywhere, and solidarity connects
all beings both here and beyond the grave. It is the kingdom of
charity with the motto: ‘One for all and all for one.’ Lastly, at the
end of your life you used to say an eternal goodbye to those dear to
you; now, however, you will say to them: See you soon!
       Such are, in sum, the results of the new revelation. It has
come to fill the void left by disbelief, to encourage those stricken
by doubt or the perspective of nothingness, and to give all things
a reason for being. Therefore, does this result have no importance
because the spirits have not come to solve the problems of science,
to give knowledge to the ignorant or the means to enrich oneself
effortlessly? Nevertheless, the fruit that humans should take from it


                                    57

                                     Genesis - Chapter I


are not only for the future life. They will enjoy it on the earth through
the transformation that these new beliefs must necessarily bring to
their character, their likes, their inclinations, and, consequently,
their habits and social relationships. Putting an end to the reign of
selfishness, pride and disbelief, these beliefs prepare the reign of the
good, which is the kingdom of God announced by Christ.15




1
    The use of the definite article before the word Christ (from the Greek Christos, anointed)
    employed in an absolute meaning is more correct, since that word is not the name of the
    Messiah from Nazareth, but rather a quality considered substantively. Thus one will say:
    Jesus was Christ; he was the Christ proclaimed, the death of the Christ and not of Christ,
    while we say: the death of Jesus and not of the Jesus. In Jesus Christ, the two words together
    form one proper name. It is for the same reason that one says: the Buddha. Gautama
    acquired the dignity of Buddha through his virtues and austerities. One says: the life of the
    Buddha in the same way that one says: the army of the Pharaoh and not of Pharaoh. Henry
    IV was king; the title of king; the death of the king and not of king. – Auth.

           The Existence of God • The Divine Nature
                  • Providence • Seeing God



                  The Existence of God
       1. Since God is the first cause of all things, the point of
departure for everything and the foundation upon which the
edifice of creation rests, God is the subject that we must consider
before anything else.
       2. It is an elementary principle that a cause is judged by its
effects, even when the cause is not seen.
       If a bird cutting through the air is hit by a fatal bullet, one
may deduce the fact that a skillful shooter struck it, even if the
shooter cannot be seen. Thus, it is not always necessary to have
seen a thing in order to know that it exists. In everything, observing
the effects is how one arrives at understanding the causes.
      3. Another equally elementary principle that has become
an axiom due to its truthfulness is that every intelligent effect must
have an intelligent cause.
      If one were to ask who the builder of a certain ingenious
mechanism was, what would the person think of someone who
answered that it had made itself? When a fine work of art or industry


                                 59

                          Genesis - Chapter II


is observed, it is stated that it must have been the product of a person
of genius, because an advanced intelligence must have presided over
its conception. Thus, it is thought that a human being must have
made it because it is known that the thing is not above human ability;
but it would never occur to anyone to state that it was the product
of the mind of a mentally impaired or an illiterate person, much less
that it is the work of an animal or a product of chance.
       4. Everywhere, the presence of human beings is recognized
by their works. The existence of antediluvian humans would
not be proven solely by human fossils, but also, and with equal
certainty, by the presence, in the ground dating to that age,
of objects constructed by humans. A pottery shard, a carved
stone, a weapon or a brick would be enough to attest to their
presence. By the crudeness or the perfection of a work, one will
recognize the degree of intelligence and advancement of those
who accomplished it. Thus, if you find yourself in a country
inhabited exclusively by primitive peoples and you happen to
find a statue that looks as if it had been made by a Pheidias, you
would not hesitate to say that, since those primitives are incapable
of having made it, it must be the work of an intelligence more
fully developed than theirs.
      5. Well then! Looking around oneself at the works of
nature, observing the foresight, the wisdom and the harmony that
preside over all things, one realizes that there is not one of them
that does not surpass the highest reach of the human mind. If
human beings could not have produced them, it is because they
are the product of an intelligence superior to that of humanity,
unless it were stated that there are effects without a cause.
     6. Some might oppose this with the following argument:
     Such works of nature are the product of natural forces that
act mechanically as a consequence of the laws of attraction and


                                  60

                                 God


repulsion; the molecules of inert bodies come together and split
apart under the imperative of these laws. Plants sprout, blossom,
grow and multiply always in the same manner, each according
to its own kind in virtue of those same laws; each individual
plant resembles the one from which it came; growth, flowering,
fructification and coloration depend on material causes such as
heat, electricity, light, humidity, etc. The same applies to animals.
The heavenly bodies were formed by molecular attraction and
continue to move in their orbits due to the effect of gravity. This
mechanical regularity in the use of natural forces does not imply
an independent intelligence. Humans move their arm whenever
they want to and however they want to, but a person who moved
it in the same way from birth to death would be an automaton.
Hence, the organic forces of nature are purely automatic.
       All of this is true; however, such forces are effects that must
have a cause, and no one claims they comprise the Divinity.
They are material and mechanical; they are not intelligent in and
of themselves, and this is true also; but they are set in motion,
distributed and suited to the needs of each thing by an intelligence
that is not human. The useful application of these forces is an
intelligent effect, which indicates an intelligent cause. A clock
moves with automatic regularity and it is this regularity that
makes it useful. The force that causes it to move is completely
material and not at all intelligent. But what would the clock be
if an intelligence had not combined, calculated and distributed
that force to make it move with precision? From the fact that such
intelligence is not inside the mechanism of the clock, and from the
fact that we do not see it, would it be rational to conclude that the
intelligence does not exist? It is proven by its effects.
       The existence of the clock attests to the existence of a
clockmaker; the ingeniousness of the mechanism attests to the
clockmaker’s intelligence and knowledge. When the clock gives


                                 61

                                      Genesis - Chapter II


you the information you need at the proper time, would anyone
ever think to say: Now that is a very intelligent clock?
       The same applies to the mechanism of the universe: God per
se does not appear but is affirmed through God’s works.
       7. The existence of God is, therefore, a fact acquired not
only through revelation but also through the material evidence of
the facts. Early peoples did not have a revelation; nevertheless, they
instinctively believed in the existence of a super-human power.
They saw things that were above human abilities and from them
concluded that such things must have come from a being superior
to humanity. Were they not more logical than those who claim
that such things were made by themselves?

                            The Divine Nature16
       8. It is not given to human beings to probe the inner nature of
God. To comprehend God, they still lack the sense that can be acquired
only through the complete purification of the spirit. However, if they
cannot grasp the essence of God – God’s existence given as a premise –
they can, by reasoning, arrive at the knowledge of God’s necessary
attributes, because, in seeing what God cannot at all cease to be
without ceasing to be God, they can arrive at what God must be.
       Without knowledge of the attributes of God, it will be
impossible to comprehend the work of creation. This is the point

16
     This section deals with the attributes of God and as in our previous translations as well
     as throughout this one, we have refrained from employing the masculine pronoun when
     referring to God (except in certain contexts such as personal spirit communications,
     scripture and historical quotes). According to The Spirits’ Book (2nd ed.), no. 1, “God is the
     Supreme Intelligence, the First Cause of all things.” In this sense, God per se is genderless.
     The grammatical structure of the present section might seem a bit awkward with the
     elimination of the masculine pronoun, but it is in keeping with the context. Kardec is
     addressing the philosophical concept of God, who is infinite in all God’s attributes. To refer
     to God by using a masculine pronoun would thus put a limitation on the infinitude of
     those attributes. God is beyond gender, and that is the point. – Tr.

of departure for all religious beliefs, and for not having referred to
them as the lighthouse that could guide them, most religions have
erred in their dogmas. Those that have not attributed omnipotence
to God have imagined many gods; those that have not attributed
supreme goodness to God make God out to be a jealous, angry,
partial and vindictive one.
       9. God is the supreme and sovereign intelligence. Human
intelligence is limited, since humans could neither make, nor
could they comprehend everything that exists. God’s intelligence,
embracing the infinite, must be infinite. If it were supposed that
God was limited at any one point, then one could conceive of a
still more intelligent being capable of comprehending and doing
what the other could not, and so on and so forth ad infinitum.
       10. God is eternal, meaning that God had no beginning
and will have no end. If God had had a beginning, God would
have had to have sprung from nothingness. But nothingness being
nothing, it cannot produce anything; or God would have been
created by another previously existing being, and therefore it is
this other being that would be God. If one were to suppose that
God had a beginning or will have an end, then one could conceive
of an entity having existed before God or capable of existing after
God, and so on ad infinitum.
      11. God is immutable. If God were subject to change, the
laws that govern the universe would have no stability.
      12. God is immaterial, meaning that God’s nature differs
from everything that we call matter. Otherwise, God would not be
immutable, because God would be subject to the transformations
of matter.
      God has no form perceivable to our senses; otherwise, God
would be matter. We say: the hand of God, the eye of God, the
mouth of God, because humans, knowing only themselves, take

                                 63

                         Genesis - Chapter II


themselves as terms of comparison for everything they do not
understand. Those images in which God is represented as an old
man with a long beard and dressed in a robe are absurd. Their
drawback is that they lower the Supreme Being to the meager
proportions of humanity; from that starting point to endowing
God with all the passions of humanity and to making God out to
be angry and jealous, there is only a small step.
      13. God is all powerful. If God did not possess supreme
power, one could conceive of a more powerful being, and so on
and so forth until one encountered the being that no other could
surpass in power, and that being would be God.
       14. God is supremely just and good. The providential wisdom
of the divine laws is revealed in the tiniest things as well as in
the greatest, and that wisdom allows no doubt about either God’s
justice or goodness.
       The infiniteness of a quality excludes the possibility of the
existence of an opposite quality that would lessen or annul it.
An infinitely good being could not contain the least fragment of
malice, nor could an infinitely evil being contain the least fragment
of goodness, in the same way that an object could not be absolutely
black with the slightest nuance of white, nor could an object be
absolutely white with the smallest speck of black.
       Hence, God could not be good and evil at the same time,
because then, not possessing either one or the other of these two
qualities to the supreme degree, God would not be God. All things
would be subject to capriciousness and nothing would have any
stability. Thus, God could be either infinitely good or infinitely
evil. Now, since God’s works bear witness to God’s wisdom,
goodness and kindness, one must conclude that, not being able to
be both good and evil at the same time without ceasing to be God,
God must be infinitely good.


                                 64

                                  God


       Supreme goodness implies supreme justice, because if God
were to act unjustly or with partiality in just one instance, or with
respect to just one of God’s creatures, God would not be supremely
just, and, consequently, would not be supremely good.
       15. God is infinitely perfect. It is impossible to conceive of a
God without infinite perfections, without which God would not
be God, because one could always conceive of a being possessing
what God lacked. In order for no other being to surpass God, God
must be infinite in everything.
       God’s attributes being infinite, they are not susceptible to
increasing or diminishing; otherwise, they would not be infinite
and God would not be perfect. If the least fragment of just one
of God’s attributes were removed, God would no longer be God,
since a more perfect being could exist.
       16. God is unique. God’s oneness is the consequence of the
absolute infiniteness of God’s perfections. Another God could not
exist except in the condition of being equally infinite in all respects,
because if between them there were the slightest difference, one
would be inferior to the other, subordinate to the other’s power,
and would not be God. If there were absolute equality between
both, there would be throughout all eternity one and the same
thought, one and the same will and one and the same power. Thus,
merged in their identity, they would in reality be only one God. If
either one had special attributes, one would do what the other did
not, and then there would not be perfect equality between them,
since neither one nor the other would possess sovereign authority.
      17. It was ignorance of the principle of the infiniteness of
God’s perfections that gave rise to polytheism, the religion of all
primitive peoples. They attributed divinity to every power that
seemed above humanity. Later, reason led them to fuse all those
various powers into only one. Then, to the degree that humans


                                  65

                           Genesis - Chapter II


understood the essence of the divine attributes, they abolished
from their symbols the beliefs that were the denial of one sole God.
      18. In sum, God cannot be God except under the condition
that God cannot be surpassed in anything by another being,
because then the being that surpassed God – in whatever way –
even by so much as a hair’s breadth, would be the true God. That
is why it is necessary that God be infinite in all things.
      It is thus in God’s existence being proven by the fact of
God’s works that, through a simple logical deduction, one arrives
at determining the attributes that characterize God.
       19. God is therefore the supreme and sovereign intelligence;
God is unique, eternal, immutable, immaterial, all powerful,
supremely just and good, infinite in all God’s perfections – it can be
no other way.
       Such is the main point on which the edifice of the universe
rests. It is the beacon, whose rays extend throughout the entire
universe, and the only one that can guide humans in their search
for the truth. Following it, they will never go astray, and if they are
often misled, it is for not having stayed the course.
       Such is also the infallible criterion for all philosophical and
religious doctrines. To evaluate such doctrines, humans have a
strictly exact measure in the attributes of God, and one can state
with certainty that every theory, every principle, every dogma, every
belief and every practice in contradiction to just one of those attributes,
or which tends not only to annul them, but simply to weaken them,
could not be of the truth.
       In philosophy, psychology, ethics and religion there is nothing true
except that which does not wander one iota from the essential qualities
of the Divinity. The perfect religion will be the one in which not
one article of faith contradicts those qualities, and in which all its
dogmas can bear the proof of that test without being affected.

                                  God


                           Providence
       20. Providence is God’s care for all creatures. God is
everywhere, sees everything and presides over everything, even the
very smallest things; this is what providential action consists of.
       How is it that God, so great, so powerful and so superior to
everything, can get involved in the tiniest details and be concerned
with the smallest acts and thoughts of each individual? Such is the
question that unbelievers ask themselves, from which they conclude
that, even if they were to believe in the existence of God, God’s action
would extend only to the general laws of the universe, and that the
universe has functioned throughout eternity by virtue of those laws,
to which all creatures are subject in their sphere of activity, without
there being any need for the incessant support of Providence.
       21. In their current little-evolved state, humans can
comprehend the infinite God only with difficulty. Since they are
bound and limited, they imagine God to be bound and limited;
they picture God as a circumscribed being and create an image
after their own. The pictures we paint of a God with human traits
have contributed in no small way to maintaining such error within
the minds of the masses, who worship God more in form than in
thought. For most, God is a powerful sovereign on an inaccessible
throne, lost in the immensity of the heavens. And because their
faculties and perceptions are limited, they cannot understand that
God could intervene or deign to intervene directly in small matters.
      22. Given how powerless humans are in comprehending
the very essence of the Divinity, they can get only a close idea with
the help of comparisons that are necessarily highly imperfect, but
which can at least show them what at first glance seems impossible.
      Let us imagine a fluid subtle enough to penetrate all objects.
Being unintelligent, this fluid acts mechanically by material forces


                                  67

                                       Genesis - Chapter II


alone. However, if we imagine this fluid to be endowed with
intelligence, perception and sensitivity, it no longer acts blindly but
with discernment, will and freedom: it sees, understands and feels.
        23. The properties of the perispiritual17 fluid can give us an
idea of this. This fluid is not intelligent per se, since it is matter,
but it is the spirit’s vehicle for thought, sensation and perception.
        The perispiritual fluid is not the spirit’s thought per se, but
it is the agent and the intermediary of that thought. Since the fluid
is what transmits the thought, it is sort of impregnated with the
thought; given the impossibility of isolating it, it seems to us that
the two are but one, like sound seems to be one with the air, in
such a way that we can materialize it, so to speak. In the same way
that we say that the air becomes sonorous, by taking the effect for
the cause we could say that the fluid becomes intelligent.
       24. Whether or not this happens with God’s thought – that
is, whether it acts directly or through the intermediary of a fluid –
in order to make it easier for us to understand, let us represent it
under the concrete form of an intelligent fluid filling the infinite
universe and penetrating every part of creation: the whole of nature
is immersed in the divine fluid. Thus, by virtue of the principle
that the parts of a whole are of the same nature and have the same
properties as the whole itself, then since each atom of this fluid –
if we may so explain it – possesses thought, that is, the essential
attributes of the Divinity, and since this fluid is everywhere, then
everything is subject to its intelligent action, its foresight, and its
solicitude. There is not one being, no matter how miniscule it may
be, that is not in some way saturated with this fluid. Hence, we are
constantly in the presence of the Divinity. There is not one of our

     From the word Perispirit: “The spirit is surrounded by a substance that might look vaporous
     to you but which is still quite dense to us [the Spirits].” (The Spirits’ Book, no. 93.) – Auth.
     (Kardec’s comment): “As a fruit seed is surrounded by the perisperm, the spirit per se is
     surrounded by an envelope, which, by comparison, may be called the perispirit.” – Tr.



                                                  68

                                God


actions that we may hide from its gaze. Our thought is in constant
contact with its thought, and it is correct to say that God reads
the deepest folds of our mind. We are in God just as God is in us,
according to what Christ said.
       To extend kindness over all creatures, God does not have to
look down from the heights of the immensity. To be heard by God,
our prayers do not have to cross through space, nor do they have
to be spoken with a resounding voice, since, God being constantly
at our side, our thoughts resound within God. Our thoughts are
like the sound of a bell, which makes all the molecules of the
surrounding air vibrate.
      25. Far be it from us even to think of materializing the
Divinity. The image of an intelligent universal fluid is obviously
only a comparison that is more appropriate for providing a more
exact idea of God than the images that represent God in human
form. It has the objective of making comprehensible God’s ability
to be everywhere and to be concerned with all things.
      26. We have always before us an example that can give us
an idea of the way in which God’s action can be exerted over the
innermost parts of all beings, and, consequently, the way in which
the most subtle impressions of our soul reach God. This example
was taken from a lesson given by a spirit on the matter:
       27. “The human being is a tiny world, where the director
is the spirit and the directed principle is the body. In this world,
the body represents a creation, of which the spirit represents God
(keep in mind that this refers only to a question of similarity
and not of identity). The parts of this body, the different organs
comprising it – muscles, nerves and joints – are other material
individualities, if you will, located at special points of the body.
Although the number of these constituent parts, so varied and
different in nature, is considerable, no one questions the fact that


                                69

                          Genesis - Chapter II


no movement may be produced or that any one impression may
occur at any particular point without the spirit being aware of it.
Are there different sensations at many points simultaneously? The
spirit senses, discerns and analyzes all of them, and assigns to each
one its cause and location, all through the intermediary of the
perispiritual fluid.
       “An analogous phenomenon occurs between God and the
creation. God is everywhere in nature, in the same way that the
spirit is everywhere in the body. All the elements of creation
are in constant relation with God, in the same way that all the
cells of the human body are in immediate contact with the
spiritual being. Thus, there is no reason why phenomena of
the same order would not be produced in an identical manner
in both cases.
       “A limb moves: the spirit senses it; a creature thinks: God
knows about it. All limbs are in movement; the various organs are
in motion; the spirit senses each manifestation, distinguishes it
and locates it. The different creations, the different creatures move,
think and act in diverse ways, and God knows about everything
that happens and assigns to each one what is particular to it.
       “One can also deduce the solidarity between matter and
intelligence, the solidarity among all the beings of one world
and of all worlds, and, finally, of all creations and the Creator.”
(Quinemant, Parisian Society, 1867).
      28. We comprehend the effect, and that is already much;
from the effect we work back to the cause and judge its greatness
by the greatness of the effect. However, its inner essence escapes us,
as does that of the cause of a huge number of phenomena. We are
familiar with the effects of electricity, heat, light and gravity and we
can calculate them; however, we are ignorant of the inner nature
of the principle that produces them. So, is it any more rational to
deny the divine principle because we do not understand it?

                                  70

                                              God


       29. Nothing prevents us from believing that the principle
of sovereign intelligence has a center of action, a main focal point
that radiates outward continuously, flooding the universe with its
emanations in the same way as the sun with its light. But where is this
focal point? That is what we cannot say. It is probable that it is not
fixed at one point any more than is its action, and that it travels the
regions of space unbound. If simple spirits have the gift of ubiquity18,
this faculty must be unlimited in God. Since God fills the universe,
one could further believe, as a hypothesis, that this focal point does
not have to move about at all, and that it is formed at every point
where the sovereign will deems it appropriate for it to occur; thus,
one could say that it is everywhere and nowhere in particular.
       30. Before these impenetrable questions, our reason must
be humbled. God exists: this we cannot doubt. God is infinitely
just and good: that is God’s essence. God’s solicitude extends to
everything: this we understand. Thus, God can desire only our
good, and that is why we must trust God: this is essential. As for
the rest, let us wait until we are worthy of understanding it.

                                     Seeing God
       31. Since God is everywhere, why can we not see God? Will
we see God when we leave earth behind? Such are the questions
that are asked every day.
       The first is easy to answer. Our physical organs have limited
perceptions that render them incapable of seeing certain things,
even material ones. Thus it is that certain fluids completely escape
both our sight and our scientific instruments; nevertheless, we do

18
     “A spirit cannot be divided up; however, each is a center radiating in different directions
     and that is why it appears to be in many places all at the same time. Look at the sun.
     The sun is only one body, yet it radiates all around and sends its rays to great distances;
     nevertheless, it does not divide itself up.” (The Spirits’ Book, no. 92.) – Tr.



                                               71

                          Genesis - Chapter II


not doubt their existence. We see the effects caused by the plague,
but we do not see the agent that carries it; we see bodies being
moved under the influence of the force of gravity, but we do not
see that force.
       32. Things of a spiritual essence cannot be perceived by
physical organs. It is through spirit sight only that we can see the
spirits and the things of the immaterial world. Thus, only our
soul could have the perception of God. Will our soul see God
immediately after death? That is what only the communications
from beyond the grave can teach us. Through them we know
that seeing God is the privilege of the most purified souls, and
that, therefore, very few, upon leaving their earthly envelope
behind, possess the necessary degree of dematerialization. A crude
comparison will make this fact easier to understand.
       33. Someone in the depths of a valley is immersed in a thick
fog and cannot see the sun. Nevertheless, because of the diffused
light, he infers the presence of the sun. If he begins to ascend a
mountain, then as he ascends, the fog begins to clear and the light
becomes brighter, but he still cannot see the sun. It is only after
climbing above the haze and finding himself in perfectly clear air
that he sees the sun in all its splendor.
       The same applies to the soul. Although invisible and
intangible to us, the perispiritual envelope is, for the soul, truly
material and still too dense for certain perceptions. This envelope
becomes spiritualized to the degree that the soul ascends in
morality. The imperfections of the soul are like layers of haze that
obscure its sight. Each imperfection that it removes is one less
stain, but it is only after it is completely purified that it enjoys the
fullness of its faculties.
      34. Since God is divine essence par excellence, God can be
perceived in all God’s glory only by spirits who have reached the


                                  72

                                  God


highest degree of dematerialization. If imperfect spirits cannot see
God, it is not because they are any farther away from God than are
the others. Like all the beings of nature, they are immersed in the
divine fluid, just as we are immersed in light. The only difference
is that their imperfections are “mists” that hide God from their
sight. When the fog finally clears, they will see God resplendent;
to do so, they will neither have to ascend nor go in search of God
in the depths of the infinite. With their spirit sight rid of the moral
veils that obscure it, they will see God wherever they may be, even
on the earth, because God is everywhere.
       35. The spirit purifies itself only over time, and its different
incarnations are the alembics at the bottom of which it leaves a
few impurities each time. Upon leaving its corporeal envelope,
it does not instantly rid itself of its imperfections. It is for this
reason that after death it does not see God any better than when
it was alive; but to the degree that it purifies itself, it has a more
distinct intuition about God. Even if it does not see God, it does
comprehend God better – the light is less diffused. Thus, when
spirits say that God is prohibiting them from responding to some
particular question, it is not that God has appeared to them or
has spoken to them in order to condone or prohibit this or that
thing – not at all; but they sense God and receive emanations from
God’s thought, just as what happens with us in relation to the
spirits who envelop us in their fluid, although we cannot see them.
       36. No human, therefore, can see God with the eyes of the
body. If such a favor were granted to a few, it would be only in the
state of ecstasy, when the soul is so disengaged from the bonds of
matter that seeing God would be possible while incarnated. Such a
privilege would be accorded only to select souls who have incarnated
on a mission and not for expiation. But since the spirits of the highest
order shine in dazzling brilliance, it could be that less evolved spirits,


                                   73

                         Genesis - Chapter II


incarnate or discarnate, impacted by the splendor that surrounds
them, have believed they have actually seen God. It is similar to a
minister sometimes being taken for his or her sovereign.
       37. Under what form does God appear to those who have
made themselves worthy of such a favor? Is it under some form?
Is it a human form or a point of resplendent light? This is what
human language is powerless to describe, because there is no
point of comparison that could provide us an idea. We are like
the blind from birth, to whom one would try in vain to explain
the radiance of the sun. Our vocabulary is limited to our needs
and the circle of our ideas. The vocabulary of early peoples could
not describe the wonders of civilization; that of the most civilized
peoples is extremely poor for depicting the splendors of heaven.
Our intelligence is too limited for comprehending them and our
very weak sight would be dazzled by them.

                Good and Evil
     The Origin of Good and Evil • Instinct and Intelligence
      • The Destruction of Living Beings by One Another



            The Origin of Good and Evil
       1. Since God is the principle of all things and since this
principle is all wisdom, all goodness and all justice, then everything
that proceeds from God must share God’s attributes. Since God is
infinitely wise, just and good, God can produce nothing unwise,
unjust or evil. Hence, the evil we see cannot have its origin in God.
      2. If evil were among the attributes of a special being that
we call Ahriman or Satan, then one of two things would apply:
either this being would be equal to God, and, consequently, as
powerful and eternal as God, or it would be inferior to God.
      In the first case, there would be two rival powers struggling
unceasingly, each seeking to undo what the other is doing, and
mutually opposing each other. This theory is irreconcilable with
the unity revealed in the order of the universe.
      In the second case, since that being is inferior to God, it
would be subordinate to God. Since it had not existed for all
eternity – which would make it equal to God – it would have had
to have had a beginning. If it was created, it could only have been


                                 75

                         Genesis - Chapter III


created by God. Thus, God would have created the Spirit of Evil,
which would be the negation of his infinite goodness. (See Heaven
and Hell, chap. X: “Demons”)
        3. Nevertheless, evil does exist and does have a cause.
        Evils of every kind – whether physical or moral – which
afflict humankind, form two categories that must be distinguished:
those that humans can avoid and those that are outside their will.
Among the latter, one must place natural calamities.
        Human beings, whose faculties are limited, can neither grasp
nor fathom the objectives of the Creator. They judge things from
the point of view of their own personality and the artificial interests
and conventions they have created for themselves, and which are
not in the order of nature. That is why they often consider as evil
and unjust what they would consider just and admirable if they were
to see the cause, the purpose and the end result. If they were to seek
each thing’s reason for being and usefulness, they would realize that
everything bears the mark of infinite wisdom, and they would bow
before that wisdom, even for the things they do not understand.
       4. Humans have received a share of intelligence that can
help them avoid, or at least largely mitigate, the effects of all
natural calamities. The more they acquire wisdom and advance
in civilization, the less such calamities will be disastrous. With
a wisely forward-looking social organization, they will at least
neutralize their consequences if they cannot be avoided entirely.
Thus, regarding those same calamities, which have their usefulness
in the general order of nature and for the future, but which cause
damage in the present, God has given humans, through the
faculties with which God has endowed their spirit, the means to
paralyze their effects.
       It is thus that humans make unhealthy areas healthy,
neutralize pestilent miasmas, make barren lands fertile and manage


                                  76

                             Good and Evil


to preserve them from floods; that they build more sanitary and
sound dwellings which are more solid against the winds that are so
necessary for the purification of the atmosphere, and in which they
shelter themselves from the elements; and finally, that, little by
little, necessity has forced them to create the sciences, which have
helped them improve the habitability of the globe and increase the
sum of their well-being.
      5. Since humans must progress, the ills to which they are
exposed are a stimulus for exercising their intelligence and all
their physical and mental capabilities, thereby inciting them to
search for the means to avoid them. If they had nothing to fear, no
need would lead them to seek such means and their minds would
become sluggish from inactivity; they would invent nothing nor
discover anything. Pain is the goad that drives humans forward on
the path of progress.
       6. However, the most numerous ills are those that humans
create for themselves due to their own vices, those that result from
their pride, selfishness, ambition and greed, and from their excesses
in all things; therein lies the cause behind the wars, calamities,
dissentions, injustices, oppression of the weak by the strong – in
short, most of the maladies that afflict them.
       God has established laws full of wisdom, which have only the
good as their purpose. Humans have within themselves everything
they need to comply with them. Their pathway is traced out by
their conscience and the divine law is engraved on their heart;
furthermore, God incessantly reminds them of these laws through
messiahs and prophets, through all the incarnate spirits who have
received the mission to enlighten, moralize and improve them,
and, in these latter times, through the multitude of discarnate
spirits who are manifesting themselves everywhere. If humans were
to conform strictly to the divine laws, there is no doubt that they would


                                   77

                             Genesis - Chapter III


avoid the most pungent ills, and that they would live happily on the
earth. If they do not, it is by virtue of their own free will, and so
they must suffer the consequences (See The Gospel according to
Spiritism, chap. V, nos. 4, 5, 6 ff.).
       7. However, God, full of goodness, has placed the remedy
alongside evil, that is to say, evil itself gives rise to the good. A time
comes when the excess of moral evil becomes intolerable and makes
humans feel the necessity to change course. Taught by experience,
they are compelled to seek a remedy in the good, but always as an
effect of their free will. When they enter onto a better path, it is
due to their will and because they realize the inappropriateness of
their earlier ways. Thus, necessity forces them to improve morally
in order to be happier, just as this same necessity has forced them
to improve the material conditions of their existence. (See no. 5)
        8. One could say that evil is the absence of the good, the same as
cold is the absence of heat. Just as cold is not a special fluid, neither is evil
a distinct attribute; one is simply the negation of the other. Thus, where
the good does not exist, evil necessarily does. Not practicing evil
is already the beginning of the good. God desires only the good; evil
proceeds only from humans. If in creation there were a being predisposed
to evil, no one could avoid it; but since humans have the cause of evil
within THEMSELVES, and at the same time have their free will and
the divine laws as a guide, they could avoid evil whenever they wished.
        Let us take a common example for comparison. A landowner
knows that at the edge of his property there is a dangerous spot,
where those who venture onto it could die or get hurt. What does
the landowner do to prevent accidents? He places a sign next to
the spot warning of the danger of going further. Such is the law;
it is wise and foresightful. If, in spite of this, imprudent persons
disregard the warning, go beyond it and something bad happens,
who can they blame but themselves?


                                       78

                                         Good and Evil


       Thus it is with all evil; humans would avoid it if they would
observe the divine laws. For example, God has put a limit on the
satisfaction of needs; humans are warned by satiety; if they surpass
this limit, they do so intentionally. The maladies, illnesses and
death that can ensue are therefore the effect of their own lack of
foresight, not God’s.
       9. If evil is the result of the imperfections of human beings,
and human beings were created by God, then one might say that,
if God did not create evil, God created the cause of evil, at least; if
God had made humans perfect, evil would not exist.
       If humans had been created perfect, fate would have led
them toward the good. However, by virtue of their free will, fate
led them neither toward the good nor toward evil. God willed
them to be subject to the law of progress, and for such progress
to be the fruit of their own effort in order for them to have the
merit for it. In the same way, they bear the responsibility for the
evil committed as a result of their free will. The issue therefore
lies in knowing the source in human beings for their propensity
toward evil.19
       10. If one were to study all the passions, and even all
the vices, one could see that they have their origin in the self-
preservation instinct. This instinct can be found in all its might in
the animals and in those primitive humans closest to the animal
existence, wherein instinct dominates exclusively. Among them
there is not yet the moral sense as a counterweight; they have not

19
     The error is in believing that the soul left the Creator’s hands already perfect, when God, to
     the contrary, wanted perfection to be the result of the gradual purification of the spirit and
     due to its own labor. God wanted the soul, by virtue of its free will, to be able to choose
     between good and evil, and for it to arrive at its final goals through a disciplined life and
     by resisting evil. If God had created the soul as divinely perfect, and that upon leaving the
     divine hands it could already partake of God’s eternal beatitude, it would not have been
     created in God’s image, but exactly like God per se. (Bonnamy: La Raison du Spiritisme,
     chap. VI). – Auth.



                                                 79

                           Genesis - Chapter III


yet awakened to the intellectual life. Conversely, instinct weakens
as intelligence develops, because intelligence dominates matter.
        The destiny of human beings lies in the spirit life; but in
the first phases of their corporeal existence there are only material
needs to satisfy, and toward that end the exercising of the passions
is a need for the preservation both of the species and individuals –
materially speaking. But once they leave that period, there are other
needs: first, semi-moral and semi-material needs; next, exclusively
moral. It is then that the spirit dominates matter; if it shakes off its
yoke, it advances along the providential path and grows closer to
its final destiny. If, to the contrary, it allows itself to be dominated
by matter, it holds itself back by identifying with the animal. In
such a situation, what was once something good because it was a need
of its condition, becomes evil, not only because it is no longer a need,
but because it becomes detrimental to the spiritualization of the being.
That which is considered an attribute in a child becomes a flaw in
an adult. So, evil is relative and responsibility for it is proportional
to the spirit’s degree of advancement.
        Therefore, all the passions have their providential usefulness;
otherwise, God would have made something useless and noxious.
It is their abuse that constitutes evil, and humans abuse things
by virtue of their free will. Later, enlightened through their own
interests, they freely choose between good and evil.

                 Instinct and Intelligence
       11. What is the difference between instinct and intelligence?
Where does one end and the other begin? Is instinct a rudimentary
intelligence or is it a distinct faculty, an exclusive attribute of matter?
       Instinct is the hidden force that drives organic beings to
spontaneous and unintentional acts, having their self-preservation in
mind. In instinctive acts there is neither reflection, calculation nor


                                    80

                            Good and Evil


premeditation. It is thus that the plant seeks the air, turns toward
the light and directs its roots toward the water and the nutritious
soil; that the flower alternately opens and closes according to
necessity; that vines wrap around their support or grasp it with
their tendrils. It is by instinct that animals are warned about what
is beneficial or harmful to them; that they seek out, according to
the season, propitious climates; that, without having been taught,
they construct, with various degrees of artfulness, and according
to species, soft bedding and shelters for their offspring, and traps
to catch prey with which they are nourished; that they skillfully
handle offensive and defensive weapons with which they are
provided; that the sexes come together; that the mother gives birth
to her offspring and that they seek the maternal breast. Among
human beings, instinct dominates exclusively at the beginning of
life. It is by instinct that children make their first movements, grip
their nourishment, cry to express their needs, imitate the sound
of the voice, and try to speak and walk. In adults certain acts are
also instinctive: such are the spontaneous movements to avoid a
hazard, to pull away from danger, and to maintain one’s balance;
such are, furthermore, the blink of the eyelids to moderate a bright
light, the automatic opening of the mouth to breathe, etc.
        12. Intelligence is revealed through intentional, thought-
out, premeditated and calculated acts, according to the turn of the
circumstances. It is undeniably an exclusive attribute of the soul.
        Every automatic action is instinctive. The action that displays
reflection, complexity and deliberation is intelligent. Intelligence is
free; instinct is not.
        Instinct is a safe guide that never errs; intelligence, by the
simple fact of being free, is at times subject to error.
        Even though the instinctive action lacks the character of the
intelligent action, it nonetheless reveals an intelligent cause that is
essentially provident. If one believes that instinct has its source

                                  81

                           Genesis - Chapter III


in matter, one must believe that matter is intelligent, even more
intelligent and provident than the soul, since instinct does not err,
whereas intelligence does.
       If instinct is considered to be a rudimentary intelligence, how
can it be that, in certain cases, it is superior to rational intelligence?
What gives it the ability to do things that intelligence cannot?
       If instinct is the attribute of a special spiritual principle, what
becomes of this principle? If instinct were to disappear, would this
principle be destroyed? If animals are endowed only with instinct,
their future is meaningless; their sufferings have no compensation.
This would not be in accord with either the justice or the goodness
of God. (See chap. II, no.19)
        13. According to another theory, instinct and intelligence
would have one and the same principle. Having arrived at a certain
degree of development, this principle, which at first would have
only the qualities of instinct, would undergo a transformation that
would give it free intelligence.
        If that were the case, in intelligent individuals who lose their
reason and are no longer guided except by instinct, intelligence
would return to its primitive state; and when they recovered their
reason, their instinct would become intelligence again, and so on
at each turn, which is not acceptable.
        Moreover, instinct and intelligence are frequently displayed
simultaneously in the same action. In walking, for example, the
movement of the legs is instinctive: the person automatically
places one foot in front of the other without thinking about it. But
when the person wants to accelerate or moderate his or her step,
to lift a foot or turn aside to avoid an obstacle, there is calculation
and complexity; he or she acts with a deliberate purpose. The
involuntary impulse of the movement is the instinctive action; the
calculated directing of the movement is the intelligent action. The
carnivorous animal is driven by instinct to eat flesh, but the

                                    82

                              Good and Evil


precautions it takes and modifies according to the circumstances
in order to catch its prey, as well as its foresight of the possibilities,
are acts of intelligence.
       14. Furthermore, another theory that allies itself perfectly
with the idea of the unity of principle results from the essentially
provident nature of instinct, and agrees with what Spiritism teaches
regarding the relations between the spirit world and the corporeal.
       It is now known that some discarnate spirits have a mission
to watch over incarnates, for whom they are protectors and guides,
that they envelop them in their fluidic emanations, and that persons
often act unconsciously under the action of these emanations.
       Moreover, it is known that instinct, which itself produces
unconscious actions, predominates in children, and, generally, in
persons whose intellect is deficient. Thus, according to this theory,
instinct would not be an attribute of either the soul or matter. It
would not belong to the living person per se, but would be an effect of
the direct action of the invisible guardians, who would compensate
for the imperfection of the intelligence by personally causing the
unconscious acts necessary for the person’s self-preservation. It
would be like the leading strings with which one supports infants
who do not yet know how to walk. However, in the same way that
we gradually eliminate the use of leading strings as children begin to
walk on their own, protector spirits leave their wards to themselves to
the extent that they can guide themselves by their own intelligence.
       Thus, far from being the product of a rudimentary and
incomplete intelligence, instinct would be the result of an outside
intelligence in its fullness, a protective intelligence making up for
insufficiency, whether of a younger intelligence – which it would
lead to do unconsciously for its own good what it was incapable
of doing for itself – or whether of a mature intelligence, but
momentarily hampered in the use of its faculties, as occurs in
humans during infancy and in cases of mental impairment.

                                   83

                         Genesis - Chapter III


      It is stated proverbially that there is a god for children, fools
and drunkards. This saying is truer than one might think. That
god is none other than the protector spirit, who watches over the
person incapable of being protected by his or her own reason.
       15. In this order of ideas one could go farther still. This
theory, as rational as it may be, does not resolve all the difficulties
of the issue.
       If one were to observe the effects of instinct, one would
notice, above and foremost, a uniformity of view and a harmony, a
surety of outcome that no longer exists when instinct is replaced by
free intelligence. Furthermore, we recognize a profound wisdom
in the allocation – so perfect and constant – of the instinctive
faculties applied to the needs of each species. Such uniformity
could not exist without unity of thought, and unity of thought
is incompatible with the diversity of individual aptitudes. Only
this unity could produce such a perfectly harmonious whole,
which has continued since the beginning of time and in all climes
with a regularity and a mathematical precision that has never
failed. The uniformity that results from the instinctive faculties
is a characteristic fact that unavoidably implies a unity of cause.
If this cause were inherent to each individuality, there would be
as many varieties of instincts as there are individuals, from the
plant to the human being. A general, uniform and constant effect
must have a general, uniform and constant cause; an effect that
attests to wisdom and providence must have a wise and provident
cause. Therefore, a wise and provident cause, being necessarily
intelligent, could not be exclusively material.
       Not finding in incarnate or discarnate individuals the
necessary qualities for producing such a result, one must look
higher, i.e., to the Creator. If one recalls the explanation that
was given concerning the manner in which one can recognize
providential action (chap. II, no. 24), and if one imagines all

                                  84

                           Good and Evil


beings penetrated by a supremely intelligent divine fluid, one will
understand the provident wisdom and the uniformity that preside
over all instinctive movements for the wellness of each individual.
Such solicitude is more active the less resources individuals have
in themselves and in their own intelligence. That is why this
solicitude shows itself greater and more absolute among animals
and primitive beings than among humans.
       According to this theory, instinct is understood to be always
a sure guide. The maternal instinct, the noblest of all, which
materialism lowers to the level of the attractive forces of matter,
is enhanced and ennobled. Due to its consequences, it should
not be left to the capricious eventualities of the intelligence and
free will. By means of the mother, God personally watches over all
newborn creatures.
       16. This theory in no way destroys the role of protector
spirits, whose aid is a fact acquired and proven through experience.
However, one should note that the action of these spirits is
essentially individual, that such action is modified according to
the qualities of the protector and the ward, and that in no way
does it have the uniformity and generality of the instinct. God,
in divine wisdom, leads the blind personally, while entrusting to
free intelligences the care of guiding those who can see, leaving
each one the responsibility for his or her acts. The mission of
protector spirits is a duty they accept voluntarily, and which is
for them a means of advancement, according to the manner in
which they perform it.
      17. All these ways of looking at instinct are necessarily
theoretical and none have a character of authenticity sufficient
to be given as a definitive solution. The issue will certainly be
resolved someday, when the elements of observation that are now
lacking are finally brought together. Until then we must limit


                                85

                         Genesis - Chapter III


ourselves to submitting the diverse opinions to the cauldron of
reason and logic, and wait for the light to appear. The solution
that will be closest to the truth will necessarily be the one that best
corresponds to the attributes of God, i.e., to supreme goodness
and justice. (See chap. II, No. 19)
       18. With instinct being the guide and the passions the
driving forces of souls in the initial period of their development,
they are sometimes confused as to their outcome. There are,
however, differences between them that are essential to consider.
       Instinct is a sure guide, always good. At some point it
may become useless, but never harmful. It weakens with the
predominance of the intelligence.
       At the early stages of the soul, the passions have in common
with instinct the fact that beings are impelled by a force that is also
unconscious. Passions are born, more particularly, from the needs of
the body and have a greater hold on the body than does instinct. What
distinguishes them above all from instinct is that they are individual
and contrary to instinct, and that they do not produce general and
uniform effects. On the contrary, we see them vary in intensity
and nature according to individuals. They are useful as stimulants
until the eclosion of the moral sense, which turns a passive being
into a rational one. At that moment, they not only become useless
but harmful to the advancement of the spirit, in whom they retard
dematerialization. They weaken with the development of reason.
       19. Persons who act consistently only by instinct might be
very good, but would leave their intelligence to remain dormant.
They are like children who do not rid themselves of their leading
strings and thus do not know how to use their legs. Those who do
not control their passions can be highly intelligent, but at the same
time very evil. Instinct disappears by itself; the passions are tamed
only through an effort of the will.

                           Good and Evil


              The Destruction of Living
               Beings by One Another
      20. The mutual destruction of living beings is one of the
laws of nature, which at first glance seems least reconcilable with
God’s goodness. One may ask why God created a need for them
to devour one another in order to nourish themselves at the
expense of others.
      To those who see only matter, who limit their view to
the present life, this indeed seems to be an imperfection in
the divine work. This is because people generally judge God’s
perfection from their own point of view; their own judgment
is the measuring stick of God’s wisdom, and they think that
God would not know how to make something better than they
themselves could do. Their short-sightedness does not allow
them to judge the whole, and they do not understand that a
real good can result from an apparent evil. Only knowledge of
the spiritual principle – considered in its true essence – and the
great law of unity that comprises the harmony of creation can
give humans the key to this mystery and show them providential
wisdom and harmony precisely where they see only an anomaly
and a contradiction.
        21. True life, for animals as well as for human beings,
dwells no more in the corporeal envelope than in a garment. True
life lies in the intelligent principle, which preexists and survives
the body. This principle has need of the body to develop itself
through labor, which it must perform on brute matter. The
body is spent in this labor but the spirit is not; on the contrary,
it leaves the body each time stronger, more lucid and more
capable. Thus, what does it matter if the spirit changes its
envelope more frequently or less so! It is no less a spirit because


                                87

                                      Genesis - Chapter III


of it. It is exactly as if a certain man were to change his clothes
a hundred times in one year; he would not cease being the
same man.
        Through the incessant spectacle of destruction, God teaches
humans the small case that they should make of their material
envelope, and awakens in them the idea of the spirit life, making
them desire it as compensation.
        Could not God, it will be asked, reach the same result by
other means, without obligating living beings to destroy one
another? If all is wisdom in God’s work, we must assume that
such wisdom must not be lacking any more on this point than
on others; if we do not understand it, we must attribute it to how
little evolved we are. However, we can try to find the reason using
this principle as our compass: God must be infinitely just and wise:
so, we seek God’s justice and wisdom in all things and we bow
down before what surpasses our understanding.
        22. A primary usefulness that arises from such destruction –
a purely physical usefulness – is this: organic bodies can sustain
themselves only with the help of organic matter; only this matter
contains the nutritive elements needed for their transformation.
Because bodies, the instruments of the intelligent principle’s
action, have the need of incessant renewal, Providence makes
them serve for their mutual sustenance. This is why beings nourish
themselves with one another. Thus, it is the body that nourishes
itself from the body, but the spirit is neither destroyed nor altered:
it only sloughs off its envelope.20
           23. Furthermore, there are moral considerations of a higher
order.
       Struggle is necessary for the evolution of the spirit.
It is in this struggle that it exercises its faculties. Those that

                                                  88

                            Good and Evil


attack in order to obtain their nutrition, and those that defend
themselves in order to preserve their life, compete in astuteness
and intelligence, and thereby increase their intellectual powers.
One of the two succumbs, but in reality, what has the stronger
or more skillful taken from the weaker? Only its garment of
flesh, nothing more. The spirit, which is not dead, will take
another later.
       24. In the less evolved beings of creation, in those in
which the moral sense does not exist, or in which intelligence
has not yet replaced instinct, struggle will have no other driving
power than the satisfaction of a material need; and one of
the most imperative needs is that of nutrition. They struggle,
therefore, solely to stay alive, i.e., to capture or defend their
prey, since they could not be stimulated by a higher motive. It
is in this preliminary period that the soul takes its first steps and
prepares for life.
       In humans there is a period of transition in which they
are hardly distinguishable from the brute. In the early stages the
animal instinct dominates and struggle still has for its motive the
satisfaction of material necessities. Later on, the animal instinct
and the moral sentiment counterbalance each other. Humans
then struggle no longer to nourish themselves, but to satisfy
their ambition, pride and the need to dominate. To do so, they
must continue to destroy. However, as the moral sense takes over,
sensitivity develops and the need for destruction decreases; it
even ends up disappearing and becoming odious. Then, humans
become horrified at bloodshed.
       Nevertheless, struggle is always necessary for the evolution
of the spirit, because even when it has reached the point that seems
culminating to us, it is far from being perfect. It is only at the
expense of its activity that it acquires knowledge and experience,
and rids itself of the last vestiges of animality. However, from

                                 89

                                    Genesis - Chapter III


that time onward, struggle, rather than being bloody and brutal,
becomes purely mental. Humans struggle against difficulties and
no longer against their fellow beings.21




1
    Without prejudging the consequences that may be taken from this principle, we only
    want to demonstrate through this explanation that the destruction of living beings by one
    another in no way invalidates the divine wisdom, and that everything in nature is linked
    together. This linkage is unavoidably broken if one ignores the spiritual principle. That is
    why so many issues are unsolvable if only matter is considered.
    Materialist doctrines carry within them the principle of their destruction. They have
    against them not only their antagonism toward the aspirations of humankind and the
    moral consequences that render them objectionable as society’s agents of dissolution,
    but also the need we feel to figure out all that is born from progress. Intellectual
    development leads humans to search for causes. Thus, even with little reflection, it would
    not take them long to recognize the powerlessness of materialism to explain everything.
    How could doctrines that satisfy neither heart, reason nor intelligence, leaving the most
    vital issues unanswered, ever prevail? The progress of ideas will kill materialism, just as it
    killed fanaticism. – Auth.

                             M

         The Role of Science
             in Genesis
       1. The history of the origin of nearly all ancient peoples
is mingled with their religion; hence, their first writings were
religious in nature, and since all religions are connected with
the beginning of things – which also includes humankind – the
explanations these religions provide regarding the formation and
arrangement of the universe is relative to the state of knowledge
at the time as well as the knowledge of their founders. That
is why the first sacred writings were simultaneously the first
writings on science, just as they were for a long time the sole
code of civil law.
       2. Because in early times the means of observation were
unavoidably highly imperfect, the first theories concerning the
system of the world would have to have been tainted with blatant
errors. But even if such means had been as complete as they are
nowadays, humans would not have known how to utilize them.
Moreover, such means could only be the result of the development
of intelligence and the consequent understanding of the laws of
nature. As humans evolved in their knowledge of those laws, they
grasped the mysteries of creation and corrected their former ideas
about the origin of things.


                               91

                         Genesis - Chapter IV


       3. People were unable to resolve the riddles of creation until
the time in which the key was given by science. It was necessary
that astronomy open the doors to infinite space to enable them to
probe its depths; that, through the power of calculus, they could
determine with strict precision the movement, position, volume,
nature and role of heavenly bodies; that physics reveal to them the
laws of gravity, heat, light and electricity; that chemistry teach them
about the transformations of matter, and mineralogy the materials
that make up the globe’s crust; that geology teach them to read in
the geological strata the globe’s gradual formation. It behooved
botany, zoology, paleontology and anthropology to initiate them
into the filiation and succession of organically structured beings.
With archeology, they could follow the footprints of humankind
across the ages. In other words, by complementing one another,
all the sciences were to bring their indispensable contingent to the
understanding of the history of the world. In their absence, people
had only their original theories as their guide.
       Likewise, before humans possessed such elements of
evaluation, all Genesis commentators, whose reasoning ran up
against material impossibilities, spun around in the same circle
without being able to depart from it. They were able to do so only
when science opened the way by breaking through the old edifice
of beliefs; then, the aspect of everything changed. Once the guide
wire was found, the problems were quickly ironed out. Instead
of an imaginary Genesis, they had a positive and, in some ways,
experimental Genesis. The domain of the universe extended into
the infinite. We saw that the earth and other heavenly bodies had
been formed gradually, according to eternal and immutable laws
that attested much better to the grandeur and wisdom of God than
did a creation that miraculously popped out of nothing – like a set
change in full view of a theater audience – because the Divinity
had suddenly changed its mind after an eternity of inaction.

                      The Role of Science in Genesis


       Since it is impossible to conceive of Genesis without the data
supplied by science, one could state in all truth that science has been
called upon to construct the real Genesis according to the laws of nature.
       4. As it now stands in the 19th century, has science resolved
all the difficulties of the problem of Genesis?
       Certainly not, but it is incontestable that it has irretrievably
destroyed all the crucial errors and has laid down the most
important fundamentals based upon irrefutable data. Properly
speaking, the points still uncertain are only a matter of detail,
whose solution, whatever it may be in the future, cannot harm
the whole. Furthermore, notwithstanding all the resources at its
disposal, it has, until now, lacked an important element, without
which the work could never be complete.
       5. Of all the ancient geneses, the one that comes closest to
modern scientific data – notwithstanding the errors it contains
that are today demonstrated by the evidence – is incontestably
that of Moses. A few of its errors are more apparent than real;
they arise either from a false interpretation of certain words, whose
original meanings have been lost in passing from one language
to another through translation, or whose acceptation has changed
with peoples’ customs, or from the allegorical form peculiar to
the Oriental style, taking it literally instead of searching for its
spiritual meaning.
      6. The Bible obviously contains things that reason,
developed by science, could not accept today, and others that
seem strange and objectionable because they are connected with
customs that are no longer ours. But alongside this, one would be
biased not to recognize that it contains great and beautiful things.
Allegory takes up considerable space in it, and behind this veil
it hides sublime truths that will come to light if we look for the
essence of the thought, because then the absurd disappears.


                                   93

                           Genesis - Chapter IV


        Why was this veil not lifted earlier? On one hand, because of
the lack of understanding that only science and a healthy philosophy
could furnish, and, on the other, because of the principle of the absolute
immutability of faith, the consequence of an overly blind respect for
literalness before which reason should bow down, and consequently,
the fear of compromising the scaffolding of beliefs framed on literal
meaning. Because these beliefs were rooted in a primitive starting
point, it was feared that if the first link of the chain were broken, the
entire weave of the network would end up coming undone. Thus,
eyes remained shut. However, shutting one’s eyes to danger does not
avert it. When a building leans, is it not more prudent to immediately
replace the faulty stones with good ones rather than, out of respect for
the building’s age, wait for the problem to become unfixable, thereby
making it necessary to rebuild it from top to bottom?
        7. In taking its investigations to the ends of the earth and into
the depths of the heavens, science has undisputedly demonstrated
the errors in the Mosaic Genesis when taken literally, and the
material impossibility for things to have happened in the exact
way they are textually recorded. In doing so, science struck a deep
blow to popular beliefs. The orthodox faith thus became unsettled
because it believed that its foundation stone had been pulled out
from under it. But which would be right: science, moving ahead
prudently and progressively over the solid ground of calculation
and observation without affirming anything before having the
proof well in hand, or a narrative written at a time when the means
of observation were completely lacking? After all, who must prevail:
someone who says that two plus two equals five and refuses to test
it, or someone who says that two plus two equals four and proves it?
      8. But then, one might ask, if the Bible is a divine revelation,
has God made a mistake? If it is not a divine revelation, it no longer
has authority and Christianity collapses for lack of a foundation.


                                   94

                    The Role of Science in Genesis


       One of two things applies: either science is wrong or it is
right. If it is right, then a contrary opinion cannot be true. There
is no revelation that can prevail over the authority of the facts.
       Incontestably, God, who is all truth, cannot induce humans
to error, either knowingly or unknowingly; otherwise, God would
not be God. Thus, if the facts contradict the words that are
attributed to God, then we must logically conclude that either
God did not speak them or such words have been misunderstood.
If religion has suffered from its contradictions in some parts,
the error is not because of science, which cannot make a fact
out of something that is not, but because of humans for having
prematurely established absolute dogmas, of which they have
made a matter of life or death concerning theories susceptible of
being disproved by experience.
       There are things that we must resign ourselves to
sacrificing – like it or not – when we cannot do otherwise. As
the world moves ahead, with the will of a few unable to stop it,
it is wisest to go along with it and adapt oneself to the new state
of affairs, rather than to cling to the past as it collapses and risk
collapsing along with it.
      9. Out of respect for the texts regarded as sacred, should
we impose silence on science? That would have been something
as impossible as keeping the earth from turning. Religions –
whichever ones they may be – have never gained anything by
upholding patent errors. Science’s mission is to discover the laws
of nature, and since those laws are works of God, they cannot be
contrary to religions founded on truth. To anathematize progress
for being detrimental to religion is to anathematize the very work
of God. Furthermore, it would be not worthwhile because all the
anathemas in the world will not prevent science from moving
forward and the truth from coming to light. If religion refuses to
move forward with science, then science will advance by itself.

                                 95

                         Genesis - Chapter IV


       10. Only stagnant religions need fear the discoveries of
science. Such discoveries are not threatening except to those who
allow themselves to be outdistanced by progressive ideas, remaining
immobilized in the absolutism of their beliefs. Generally, they have
such a miniscule idea of the Divinity that they cannot understand
that assimilating the laws of nature revealed by science means
glorifying God for God’s works. In their blindness, they prefer to
pay homage to the Spirit of Evil. Any religion that would not be in
contradiction with the laws of nature at any point would have nothing
to fear of progress and would be invulnerable.
       11. Genesis entails two parts: the history of the formation
of the physical world and that of humankind considered from its
two-fold principle: corporeal and spiritual. Science is limited to
studying the laws that govern matter; regarding human beings, it
studies only the corporeal envelope. From this aspect, it has grasped
with incontestable precision the principal parts of the mechanism
of the universe and the human organism. Thus, concerning that
crucial point, it can therefore complete the Genesis of Moses and
rectify its faulty parts.
       But the history of the human being from the spiritual point
of view is linked to a special order of ideas that is not within the
domain of science per se, and therefore science has not made it an
object of its investigations. Philosophy, which more particularly
has this genre of study among its attributions, has formulated
only contradictory theories concerning the point at issue, from
pure spirituality all the way to the denial of the spiritual principle
altogether – and God even – with no other bases than the personal
ideas of their authors. Thus, philosophy has left the issue undecided
for lack of sufficient verification.
      12. This issue, however, is of utmost importance for human
beings, because it addresses the problem of their past and future.


                                 96

                      The Role of Science in Genesis


The problem of the physical world affects them only indirectly.
What is important for them more than anything else is to know
where they have come from and where they are going; whether
they have already lived and if they will continue to do so, and what
fate is reserved for them.
        Concerning all such matters, science is mute. Philosophy
provides only opinions that diametrically oppose one another, but
at least it allows for discussion, which leads many individuals to
rally to its side rather than that of religion, which it does not discuss.
       13. All religions are in agreement as to the principle of the
existence of the soul, without, however, demonstrating it. Even so,
they are not in agreement as to the soul’s origin, nor its past or its
future, especially – and this is essential – as to the conditions upon
which its future fate depends. Most of them impose on the beliefs
of their followers a picture of the soul’s future that could only be
accepted on blind faith because it cannot hold up under serious
examination. Because the destiny they accord to the soul is linked
in their dogmas to the ideas once held about the material world
and the mechanism of the universe in ancient times, such destiny
is irreconcilable with the state of current knowledge. Thus, since
they can only lose out to examination and discussion, religions
have found it simpler to proscribe both.
       14. From the disagreements concerning the future of the
human being, both doubt and disbelief have arisen. However,
disbelief has left a painful emptiness. Humans regard with anxiety
the unknown, which, sooner or later, they will unavoidably have
to enter. The idea of nothingness chills them. Their conscience
tells them there is something beyond the present, but what?
Their developed reason no longer allows them to accept the
stories that comforted them in childhood, taking allegory for
reality. What is the meaning of such allegory? Science has pulled


                                   97

                         Genesis - Chapter IV


back a corner of the veil, but it has not revealed what is most
important for them to know. They question in vain, but no one
answers in a peremptory or appropriate manner to calm their
apprehensions. Everywhere, they encounter affirmation clashing
with negation, without proofs that are more positive on one
side or the other. Hence the uncertainty, and uncertainty about
matters of the future life makes people throw themselves frantically
into the things of the material life.
       Such is the unavoidable effect of times of transition: the
edifice of the past collapses but that of the future has not yet been
built. Humans are like adolescents who no longer hold to the naive
beliefs of their early years, but who do not yet have the knowledge
of adulthood. They have only vague yearnings that they do not
know how to define.
       15. If the question of the spiritual individual remained a
theory until now, it was because humans lacked the means of direct
observation needed to observe the state of the material world, and
the field remained open to the conceptions of the human mind. As
long as humans did not know about the laws that govern matter
and could not apply the experimental method, they erred from
theory to theory regarding the mechanics of the universe and the
formation of the earth. This occurred both in the mental order
and the physical order. In order to set their ideas, they lacked the
essential element: knowledge of the laws of the spiritual principle.
This knowledge was reserved for our time, just as the laws of
matter were the work of the past two centuries.
       16. Until now, the study of the spiritual principle in
metaphysics was purely speculative and theoretical; in Spiritism,
it is completely experimental. With the help of the faculty of
mediumship, more developed in our day and, above all, generalized
and more thoroughly studied, humans are in possession of a new


                                 98

                    The Role of Science in Genesis


instrument of observation. Mediumship has been for the spirit
world what the telescope has been for the heavenly world and the
microscope for the infinitely small world. Mediumship has enabled
humans to explore and study with their own eyes, so to speak, the
spirit world’s relations with the corporeal world; to isolate, in the
living human, the intelligent being from the physical being, and
to see them acting separately. Once relations with the inhabitants
of this spirit world were established, it was finally possible to
follow the soul in its evolutionary ascent, its migrations and its
transformations. One could finally study the spiritual element.
That is what previous commentators on Genesis lacked in order
to understand it and rectify the errors.
       17. The spirit and material worlds are in constant contact
and are thus in solidarity with each other; both have their share of
the action in Genesis. Without knowledge of the laws that govern
the former, it would be as impossible to construct a complete
Genesis as it is for a sculptor to give life to a statue. Only now,
while neither material science nor spiritual science have spoken
their final word, do humans possess the two elements suitable for
shedding light on this huge problem. It was necessary to have these
two keys to arrive at a solution – even an approximate one.

                              M

        Ancient and Modern
          World Theories
       1. The first idea that humans formed about the earth, the
movement of the heavenly bodies and the constitution of the
universe had to have been based at the beginning solely on the
attestation of the senses. Not knowing about the most elementary
laws of physics and the forces of nature, and having nothing
except sight as a means of observation, they could judge only by
appearances.
       Seeing the sun appear in the morning at one end of the
horizon and then disappear in the evening at the opposite end,
they naturally concluded that the sun revolved around the earth,
which remained stationary. If, at the time, someone had told them
that the opposite occurred, they would have responded that such
could not be; they would have stated, “We see the sun changing
places but we do not feel the earth moving.”
      2. The short distance of excursions, which rarely went
beyond the limits of the tribe or the valley, could not corroborate
the fact that the earth was round. Besides, how could it be
imagined that the earth was a ball? After all, people would not
have been able to stand up except on the top, and assuming the
earth to be inhabited over its entire surface, how could people be


                               101

                                     Genesis - Chapter V


living in the opposite hemisphere with their head down and their
feet up? The matter would have seemed even less possible with
the earth’s rotational movement. Even nowadays, when the law of
gravity is known, there are relatively knowledgeable people who
do not understand this phenomenon; one should not marvel that
early humans did not even suspect it.
       Hence, to them the earth was a flat, circular surface like
a millstone, extending to be lost from view in the horizontal
direction. Thus the expression still used: “To go to the ends of the
earth.” Its edges, depth, interior and lower surface were unknown.22
      3. The sky, appearing in concave form, was, according to
common belief, in fact a canopy, whose lower edges rested on the
earth and marked out its boundaries; it was a vast dome filling
with sky. Without any notion of the infinite or space – incapable
of even conceiving of it – people imagined that this canopy was
made of solid matter; hence the name firmament, which has
survived the belief and which means firm, resistant (from the Latin
firmamentum, derived from firmus and from the Greek herma,
hermatos, firm, support, prop, point of support).
      4. The stars, whose nature they could not suspect, were
simply luminous points of various sizes, attached to the canopy like
22
     “Hindu mythology taught that, in the evening, the day star extinguished its light and crossed
     the sky during the night with a dark face. Greek mythology represented the sun as Apollo’s
     chariot pulled by four horses. Anaximander of Miletus believed, in accord with Plutarch, that
     the sun was a chariot filled with a very bright fire that escaped through a circular opening.
     Epicurus, according to some, would have expressed the opinion that the sun lit up in the
     morning and faded in the evening in the waters of the ocean; others think that he believed
     that it was a pumice stone heated to an incandescent state. Anaxagoras considered it to be a
     heated iron the size of the Peloponnesus. A singular remark! The ancients were so invincibly
     led to consider the apparent size of the sun as real that they persecuted the daredevil
     philosopher for having attributed such a large volume to the day star, and all the authority
     of Pericles was needed to save him from being condemned to death and to commute his
     sentence to exile.” (Flammarion, Etudes et lectures sur l’astronomie, p. 6).
     If they held to such ideas in the fifth century before the Christian era, at the time of
     Greece’s greatest intellectual prosperity, one cannot marvel at the ideas held by earliest
     humankind regarding the theory of the world. – Auth.

suspended lamps and scattered over a single surface; consequently,
all were the same distance from the earth, in the same way that
they are represented inside certain domes painted blue to imitate
the blue of the sky.
       While today’s ideas are completely different, the use of
ancient expressions has been preserved. It is still stated, for instance:
the starry canopy; under the dome of heaven.
       5. The formation of clouds due to the evaporation of
earth’s waters was equally unknown at the time. It would not have
crossed anyone’s mind that the rain that fell from the sky had its
origin on the earth, from which no one could see it rise. Thus,
the belief in the existence of waters above and waters below, of
heavenly springs and terrestrial springs, and of reservoirs located
in the high regions: an assumption that agreed perfectly with
the idea of a solid canopy capable of holding them. The waters
above escaped through cracks in the canopy to fall as rain, and
depending on the length of these cracks, the rain was either light
or torrential and diluvial.
       6. Complete ignorance regarding the whole of the universe
and the laws of nature that govern it, the composition and
destination of the heavenly bodies, which, after all, appear so small
in comparison to the earth, necessarily led to the view that the
earth was the principal thing, the sole goal of creation, and that
the heavenly bodies were merely accessories created exclusively
for its inhabitants. This preconception has been perpetuated even
nowadays despite the discoveries of science that have changed
humankind’s aspect of the world. How many people still believe
that the stars are ornaments in the sky meant solely for the
enjoyment of earth’s inhabitants!
      7. It did not take long to perceive the apparent movement
of the stars, which moved en mass from east to west, rising in


                                  103

                                   Genesis - Chapter V


the evening and setting in the morning, and preserving their
respective positions. For a long time this observation had no other
consequence except confirming the idea of a solid canopy carrying
the stars along in its rotational movement.
       Such early, simplistic ideas were, for long centuries of time,
the foundation of religious beliefs and served as the basis for all
ancient cosmogonies.
       8. Later, by the direction of the movement of the stars and
their periodic return in the same order, it was perceived that the
celestial canopy could not be simply a semi-sphere anchored over
the earth, but an entire hollow sphere, in whose center was the
earth, always flat – or more or less convex – and inhabited only on
its upper surface. This was progress, at least.
       But upon what was the earth anchored? It would be pointless
to report all the foolish notions conceived by the imagination,
such as that of the Indians, who said that it was supported by four
white elephants resting on the wings of a huge vulture. The most
sensible confessed that they had no idea.
       9. However, one opinion widespread among the pagan
theogonies23 located the habitation of the condemned in the lower
places, that is, in the depths of the earth, about which not much
was known, and which was called inferno [hell], which means the
inferior places, and the habitation of the blessed in the upper places
beyond the region of the stars. The word inferno has remained to
our time, although it has lost its etymological significance because
geology has dislodged the place of eternal sorrows from the innards
of the earth and because astronomy has demonstrated that there is
no upper or lower in infinite space.

     1991, op. cit.) – Tr.

                   Ancient and Modern World Theories


       10. Under the clear sky of Chaldea, India and Egypt, the
birthplaces of the most ancient civilizations, the movement of the
heavenly bodies could be observed with as much precision as the lack
of special instruments allowed. It was first noted that certain stars
moved independently from the others, which no longer allowed the
supposition that they were attached to the canopy. They were called
wandering stars or planets to distinguish them from the fixed stars.
Their movements and periodic returns were calculated.
       In the diurnal movement of the starry sphere, the immobility
of the North Star was observed, around which the others moved
every twenty-four hours and in parallel oblique circles, some
larger, others smaller, according to their distance from the central
star. This was the first step toward the realization that the earth’s
axis was tilted. Longer voyages enabled observing the difference in
the aspect of the sky according to latitude and season. The height
of the North Star above the horizon varied with the latitude and
showed the way to the roundness of the earth. Thus, little by little,
a more precise idea of the world was arrived at.
       Around 600 B.C. Thales of Miletus (Asia Minor) discovers the
sphericity of the earth, the tilt of the axis and the cause of eclipses.
       A century later, Pythagoras of Samos discovers the diurnal
movement of the earth on its axis and its annual movement around
the sun, and he links the planets and comets to the solar system.
       Hipparchus of Alexandria (Egypt), 160 years B.C., invents
the astrolabe, calculates and predicts eclipses, observes sunspots
and determines the tropical year and the duration of the moon’s
revolutions.
       As valuable as these discoveries were for the progress of
science, they took nearly 2,000 years to become popularized.
Since new ideas had no means for their publication except rare
manuscripts, they remained the patrimony of a few philosophers,
who taught them to their privileged disciples. The masses, whom


                                  105

                          Genesis - Chapter V


no one bothered to enlighten, did not benefit from them at all and
continued to hold to their old beliefs.
       11. Around 140 A.D., Ptolemy, one of the most illustrious
men of the Alexandrian School, combined his own ideas with
common beliefs and with a few of the more recent astronomical
discoveries and composed a theory that one might call “mixed,”
which bore his name, and was the only one adopted in the civilized
world for close to fifteen centuries.
       According to the Ptolemaic theory, the earth is a sphere
in the center of the universe; it is composed of four elements:
earth, water, air and fire. This was the first region and was called
elementary. The second, called ethereal, encompassed eleven heavens
or concentric spheres spinning around the earth, as follows: the
heavens of the moon, of Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, the fixed stars, the first crystalline transparent solid sphere,
the second crystalline sphere, and finally, the first mobile sphere,
which gave movement to all the lower heavens and caused them to
make one revolution every twenty-four hours. Beyond the eleven
heavens was Empyrean, the habitation of the blessed, derived from
the Greek pyr or pur, meaning fire, because it was believed that this
region blazed with light like fire.
       The belief in many superimposed heavens prevailed for a
long time, but it varied regarding the number. The seventh heaven
was usually considered the highest; hence the expression: To be
taken up to the seventh heaven. St. Paul said that he had been
taken up to the third heaven.
       Independent of the common movement, the heavenly
bodies had, according to Ptolemy, their own movements that
were more considerable or less so, depending on their distance
from the center. The fixed stars made one revolution every 25,816
years. This calculation implies knowledge of the precession of the
equinoxes, which actually takes 25,868 years.

                                  106

                  Ancient and Modern World Theories


        12. At the beginning of the 16th century, Copernicus, a
famous astronomer, born in Thorn (Prussia) in 1472 and died in
1543, takes up Pythagoras’ ideas. He publishes a theory which,
confirmed every day by new observations, was favorably received
and did not take long to debunk that of Ptolemy. According to this
theory, the sun is in the center and the planets trace out circular
orbits around it; the moon is a satellite of the earth.
        A century later, in 1609, Galileo, born in Florence, invents
the telescope. In 1610 he discovers the four moons of Jupiter and
calculates their revolutions. He realizes that the planets do not have
their own light like the stars but that they are illuminated by the sun
and are spheres like the earth. He observes their phases and determines
the duration of their rotation on their axes; thus, with physical proof
he gives a definitive sanction to the theory of Copernicus.
        From there the foundation of the superimposed heavens
collapsed. The planets were recognized as being worlds similar
to the earth and, like it, undoubtedly inhabited; the stars are
innumerable suns, probable centers of as many other planetary
systems; and the sun itself was recognized as being a star, the center
of a vortex of planets subject to it.
        The stars are no longer confined within a zone of the celestial
sphere but are irregularly scattered throughout limitless space; those
that seem to touch each other are actually at incommensurable
distances from one another; the smallest in appearance are the
most distant from us; the larger ones, those that are the closest, are
still hundreds of thousands of leagues away.
        The groups to which were given the name constellations are
only apparent groupings caused by distance; their shapes are the
effects of perspective, like the shapes forming for someone standing
at a fixed point, observing lights spread out over a vast plain or the
trees of a forest. In reality, however, such groupings do not exist. If
one could be transported to a region of one of these constellations,


                                 107

                          Genesis - Chapter V


to the degree that one got closer, its form would disappear and
new groups would take shape.
       Since these groups exist only in appearance, the significance
that a superstitious common belief attributes to them is illusory
and its influence could exist only in the imagination.
       To distinguish the constellations from one another, they
were given names such as Leo, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo, the Scales,
Capricorn, Cancer, Orion, Hercules, Ursa Major or David’s Chariot,
Ursa Minor, the Lyre, etc., and were represented as shapes that those
names – mostly from fantasy – brought to mind, but which in
most cases have no relation to the apparent shape of the group of
stars. Thus, it is pointless to seek such shapes in the sky.
       The belief in the influence of the constellations, especially
those that comprise the twelve signs of the Zodiac, comes from the
idea connected to the names they bear. If the one called Leo had
been called ass or sheep, one would certainly have attributed to it a
completely different influence.
       13. Beginning with Copernicus and Galileo, the ancient
cosmogonies were destroyed forever. Astronomy could only evolve,
not regress. History tells of the struggles that those men of genius
had to endure against prejudices and, above all, against the spirit of
sectarianism, which was interested in maintaining the errors upon
which belief had been founded and which had been thought to be
firmly set on an unshakable base. It took only the invention of one
optical instrument to demolish a foundation of many thousands of
years. However, nothing could prevail against a truth recognized
as such. Thanks to the printing press, the public was initiated into
these new ideas; no longer lulled to sleep with illusions, it joined
the fray. It was no longer a few individuals that had to be combated,
but general opinion, which took up the defense of the truth.
       How grand the universe is in comparison with the miniscule
proportions that our ancestors assigned to it! How sublime the

                                 108

                   Ancient and Modern World Theories


work of God is when we see it accomplished according to the
eternal laws of nature! But also, how much time, how much effort
of genius, how much dedication was necessary to open people’s
eyes and finally remove the blindfold of ignorance!
       14. From there, the way was opened onto which illustrious
and numerous scholars were to enter in order to complete the work
that had been sketched out. In Germany, Kepler discovers the
famous laws that bear his name, through which it is recognized that
the planets do not trace out circular orbits but elliptical ones, of
which the sun occupies one of the focal points. In England, Newton
discovers the law of universal gravity. Laplace, in France, creates
celestial mechanics. Finally, astronomy is no longer a system founded
on conjecture or probability, but a science established on the strictest
bases of calculus and geometry. Thereby, one of the fundamental
stones of Genesis is laid around 3,300 years after Moses.

                                Space and Time
       1. Many definitions of space have been given; the
principal one is this: space is the expanse that separates two
bodies. From this, certain sophists have concluded that where
there were no bodies, there would be no space. This is what
doctors of theology stood on to claim that space was necessarily
finite, alleging that bodies, limited to a certain number, could
not form an infinite series, and that where bodies ended, space
would also end. Space has also been defined as: the place where
worlds move about, the void in which matter acts, etc. Let us
leave all such definitions – which do not define anything – in
the treatises where they lie.

     Parisian Spiritist Society in 1862 and 1863 under the title: Uranographical Studies, signed

       Space is one of those terms which represent a self-evident,
primitive and axiomatic idea, and which the many definitions that
may be given to it serve only to obscure. We all know what space is and
I wish only to affirm its infiniteness so that in our subsequent studies
there will be no barrier opposing the investigation of our objective.
       Thus, I will state that space is infinite for the reason that
it is impossible to imagine it as having any limit, and that, in
spite of the difficulty we have in conceiving of the infinite, it
is nevertheless easier for us to go on forever through space via
thought than for us to stop at any point beyond which we would
find no more expanse to traverse.
       For us to picture the infiniteness of space with our limited
faculties, let us suppose that upon leaving the earth – which is lost
in the midst of the infinite – we head toward some point in the
universe at the prodigious speed of an electric spark (which crosses
thousands of leagues each second). Having barely left this globe and
yet, having traveled millions of leagues, we find ourselves in a place
from which the earth appears as nothing more than a pale star. An
instant later (always going in the same direction), we approach
the far-off stars that you can hardly make out from your terrestrial
station. And from there, not only is the earth lost to your sight
in the depths of the heavens, but even your sun in its splendor
has been eclipsed by the expanse that separates it from us. Always
traveling at the same speed of light25, we cross through systems of
worlds at every step in which we proceed through the expanse –
islands of ethereal light, starry ways and magnificent landscapes,
where God has sown worlds in the same profusion with which he
sowed the plants on earth’s prairies.


25
     In 1983 the 17th General Conference on Weights and Measures (Conférence Générale des
     Poids et Mesures) adopted a standard value of 299,792,458 meters/sec. for the speed
     of light. In imperial units, that is about 186,282.397 miles/sec., or roughly one foot/
     nanosecond. Source : www.bipm.org. – Tr.

                          General Uranography


        Now, it has only been a few minutes since we started and
already hundreds of millions and millions of leagues separate us from
the earth, thousands of worlds have passed under our eyes – yet,
listen! In reality, we have not advanced one single step in the universe.
        If we were to continue for years, centuries, thousands
of centuries and millions of periods a hundred times as long as
centuries, and always at the same speed of light, we would have
advanced hardly at all! And thus it is, no matter where we might
be and no matter to what point we might head from that invisible
grain of sand which we left behind and which we call Earth.
        That is what space is!
       2. Time, like space, is a self-defining word. One can get a
more exact idea of it by relating it to the infinite whole.
       Time is the sequence of things. It is connected to eternity
in the same way that things are connected to the infinite. Let us
imagine we are at the beginning of our earth in that first epoch in
which it had not yet moved under the divine impulse, i.e., at the
beginning of Genesis. Time has not yet left the mysterious cradle
of nature, and no one can say what age we are in, because the
pendulum of time has not yet been set in motion.
       But silence! The first hour of a lonely earth sounds at the
eternal bell, the planet begins to move through space, and from
then on there are evening and morning. Beyond earth, eternity
remains impassive and unmoving, although time has been
marching steadily forward on other worlds. On the earth, however,
time replaces eternity, and over a given series of generations one
will count the years and centuries.
       Now let us transport ourselves to the final day of that earth,
to the hour in which, bowed under the weight of old age, it will be
erased from the book of life never to appear again. Here, the chain
of events stops; the terrestrial movements that measure time cease
and time ends with them.

                                  113

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


       This simple exposition of the natural things that have
given birth to time, nourishing it and allowing it to stretch out,
is enough to show that, from the point of view in which we must
place ourselves for our investigation, time is but a drop of water
that has fallen from a cloud into the sea and whose fall is measured.
       There are as many worlds in the vast expanse as there are
different and incongruent times. Outside these worlds, only
eternity replaces such ephemeral sequences and peacefully fills the
immensity of the heavens with its immovable light. Immensity
without boundaries and eternity without bounds: such are the two
great properties of the nature of the universe.
       The eye of the observer, traversing the incommensurable
distances of space without ever encountering an obstacle, and
the eye of the geologist, piercing beyond the limits of the ages or
descending into the depths of a wide-open eternity – where both
will be lost someday – act in harmony, each in its own way, to
acquire this two-fold idea of the infinite: extent and duration.
       Well then, holding to this order of ideas, it will be easy for
us to realize that, in regards to time being simply the relationship
between transitory things and depending solely on things that are
measured, if we took earth’s centuries as units and stacked them
thousands upon thousands to form a colossal number, that number
would never represent more than a point in eternity, in the same
way that thousands of leagues added to thousands of leagues are
nothing but a point in the extent of space.
       Thus, for example, since centuries are outside the ethereal
life of the soul, we could write a number as long as the earth’s
equator and imagine that we have aged by this number of
centuries without our soul actually tallying one day more. And
adding to this indefinable number of centuries another long series
of similar numbers stretching from here to the sun – or even to a
more considerable distance – and then imagining ourselves living


                                 114

                          General Uranography


over the course of the prodigious sequence of century-long periods
represented by the sum of such numbers, once we came to the end
of the inconceivable mountain of centuries that would weigh on
our heads, it would be as if they did not exist at all: before us, all
eternity would still remain.
      Time is but a relative measure of the sequence of transitory
things; eternity is not susceptible to any kind of measure from
the point of view of duration; there is no beginning or end: for
eternity the present is all there is.
      If centuries of centuries are less than one second relative to
eternity, what is to be said about a human life!

                              Matter
        3. At first glance, nothing seems so profoundly varied, so
essentially distinct, as the diverse substances that comprise the world.
Among the objects that art or nature passes before us every day, are
there any two that display a perfect identity, or even an equivalence
of composition? Between the atmospheric gases and the vein of gold,
and between the aqueous molecule of a cloud and the mineral that
forms the osseous framework of the globe, what dissimilarity there
is from the point of view of solidity, compressibility, weight and the
many properties of bodies! Between the chemical tissue of the various
plants that adorn the vegetable kingdom and the no-less numerous
representatives of earth’s animal kingdom, what diversity there is!
        Nevertheless, we can establish as an absolute principle the
fact that all substances, known and unknown, no matter how
dissimilar they may seem, whether from the inner composition
point of view or from the aspect of their reciprocal action, are in fact
nothing more than different modes under which matter presents
itself, nothing more than varieties into which it is transformed
under the direction of the innumerable forces that govern it.

                                    Genesis - Chapter VI


       4. Chemistry, whose progress has been so rapid since my
time, when its adherents still relegated it to the secret realm of
magic, is a new science that can rightly be regarded as being an
offspring of the era of the observer, because it is uniquely based
much more solidly on the experimental method than were its
older siblings. Chemistry, I say, made good sport of the four
primitive elements that the ancients agreed to recognize in nature;
it showed that the element ‘earth’ is simply the combination of
an infinitely varied diversity of substances; that air and water are
also decomposable and are the products of a certain number of
equivalents of gas; and that fire, far from being a principal element
per se, is also only a state of matter resulting from the universal
movement to which it is submitted and from a perceptible or
latent combustion.
       In return, chemistry discovered a considerable number
of previously unknown principles which seemed to use certain
combinations to form the diverse substances and the diverse bodies
that chemistry studied, and which acted simultaneously, according to
certain laws and in certain proportions, in the processes taking place
in the great laboratory of nature. Chemistry labeled such principles
simple bodies, thereby indicating that it regarded them as primitive
and indecomposable, and that no operation, until the present, could
reduce them further into relatively more simple components.26
       5. However, where human perception stops, even aided by
the most sensitive tools, the work of nature continues. There, where
common folk take appearance for reality, where the professional lifts
the veil and perceives the beginning of things, the eyes of those who
are able to grasp the mode of action of nature see in the constitutive

26
     The main simple bodies are: among the non-metallic ones, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
     chlorine, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur and iodine; among the metallic ones, gold, silver,
     platinum, mercury, lead, pewter, zinc, iron, copper, arsenic, sodium, potassium, calcium,
     aluminum, etc. – Auth.

materials of the world only the one primitive, simple cosmic matter,
which became diversified in certain regions at the time of their origin,
and which was divided up into interdependent bodies possessing
a life of their own only to become disassembled one day by their
decomposition in the receptacle of the expanse of space.
      6. There are questions that we ourselves – spirits who love
science – would not know how to probe, and about which we
could offer nothing but more or less conjectural personal opinions.
Regarding such questions, I will either keep silent or justify my
way of viewing them; however, this particular question is not one
of them. Therefore, to those who would be tempted to see in my
words only an audacious theory, I will say: Examine, if possible, the
multiplicity of the operations in nature and you will realize that, if
we do not accept the unity of matter, it will be impossible to explain
not only the suns and the globes, but, without going so far, the
germination of a seed in the ground or the production of an insect.
       7. If we observe such a diversity in matter, it is because
there were an unlimited number of forces that presided over
its transformations, and since the conditions under which such
transformations were produced were also unlimited in number,
the varied combinations of matter could only be unlimited.
       Thus, whether the substance being considered belongs to
the fluids per se, i.e. the imponderable bodies, or whether it is
dressed in the ordinary character and properties of matter, then in
the whole universe there is only one single primitive substance: the
cosmos or cosmic matter of the uranographers.

                      Laws and Forces
       8. If one of those unknown beings that spend their ephemeral
existence in the depths of the darkest regions of the ocean; if one of


                                  117

                                     Genesis - Chapter VI


those multi-stomached creatures, one of those nereids – those lowly
microscopic creatures that do not know anything about nature except
the ichthyophagous fish and submarine forests – were to suddenly
receive the gift of intelligence, the ability to study its world and to
establish on its evaluations an extensive conjectural reasoning process
regarding the universality of things, what idea would it form about
the living nature that develops in its environment and about the
terrestrial world that does not belong to the field of its observations?
       If now, by some marvelous effect of its new ability, this
same being managed to rise from the eternal darkness to reach the
surface of the ocean not far from the lush shores of a splendidly
vegetated island bathed by the bountiful sun – the dispenser of
salutary warmth – what would its opinion be about its previously-
formed theory on the universal creation, a theory that it would
immediately scrap in light of a broader evaluation, although still
relatively as incomplete as the first? Such, O humans, is the picture
of your completely speculative science.27
      9. Thus, having come to address the issue of the laws
and forces that govern the universe, I, who, like you, am only a
being who is relatively ignorant in comparison to real knowledge,
notwithstanding the apparent ascendancy – with respect to my
brothers and sisters of earth – that gives me the ability to study
questions of nature that are off-limits to them in their current
position, my sole objective is to expose you to a general idea about
the universal laws without explaining in detail the mode of action
and the nature of the special forces that depend on them.

27
     Such is also the situation of those who deny the world of spirits, when, after they rid
     themselves of their corporeal envelope, the horizons of that world are exposed to their
     eyes. They then understand the emptiness of the theories by which they claimed to
     explain everything solely through matter. Nevertheless, even those horizons hold for
     them mysteries that are revealed only progressively to the degree that they evolve by
     means of purification. From their first steps in that new world, however, they are forced to
     acknowledge their blindness and their distance from the truth. – Auth.

       10. There is an ethereal fluid that fills space and penetrates
bodies. This fluid is the ether or primitive cosmic matter, the
generator of the universe and beings. Inherent to this ether are
the forces that preside over the metamorphoses of matter, the
immutable and necessary laws that govern the universe. These
multiple forms, indefinably varied according to the combinations
of matter, localized according to masses and diversified in their
modes of action, depending on the circumstances and conditions,
are known on earth as gravity, cohesion, affinity, attraction,
magnetism and electricity. The vibratory movements of this agent
are known as sound, heat, light, etc. On other worlds, they manifest
under other aspects and display other characteristics unknown on
this one, and in the immense expanse of the heavens, countless
forces have been developed on an unimaginable scale, and we
are little able to evaluate their greatness, just as the crustacean in
the depths of the ocean is unable to embrace the universality of
terrestrial phenomena.28
       Thus, in the same way that there is only one simple,
primitive substance, the generator of all bodies, but in which its
combinations are diversified, all such forces depend on a universal
law which is diversified in its effects, and which, by eternal decree,
was sovereignly imposed on creation to impress it with harmony
and stability.

28
     We all relate to what we know, and we do not comprehend what escapes the perception
     of our senses, any more than a person blind from birth would understand the effects of
     light and the usefulness of the eyes. Thus, it may be that in other environments the cosmic
     fluid could have properties and combinations about which we have no idea, effects that
     are appropriate for necessities unknown to us, giving way to new perceptions or other
     modes of perception. For example, we do not understand how the eyes of the body
     could see without light. But who could say that there are not other agents besides light
     for which special organs are intended? Somnambulistic sight, which is not hindered by
     distance, material obstacles or darkness, offers us an example. Let us suppose that, on a
     given world, the beings are normally what our somnambulists are only exceptionally; they
     have need of neither our light nor our eyes, but nonetheless, they see what we cannot. The
     same applies to all the other senses. Conditions for vitality and perceptibility, sensations
     and necessities, vary according to the environmen t. – Auth.

                          Genesis - Chapter VI


       11. Nature has never contradicted itself. The emblem of the
universe has only one motto: UNITY/DIVERSITY. Ascending
the scale of worlds, unity in harmony and creation is found at
the same time that an infinite diversity is found in the immense
flowerbed of the stars. Traversing the degrees of life from the least
of beings up to God, the grand law of continuity is recognized. In
considering the forces per se, one can form a series, whose result,
merging with the generatrix, is the universal law.
       You cannot evaluate this law in its full extent, since the forces
that represent it in the field of your observations are restricted and
limited. However, gravity and electricity can be regarded as a broad
application of the primordial law that reigns beyond the heavens.
       All these forces are eternal – we will explain this term –
and universal like the creation. Being inherent to the cosmic
fluid, they necessarily act in everything everywhere, modifying
their actions through their simultaneousness or successiveness;
they predominate here; they wane there; they are powerful
and active at certain points; latent or hidden at others; but
ultimately, they prepare, guide, conserve and destroy worlds in
their various stages of life, and they govern the marvelous works
of nature wherever they take place, ensuring forevermore the
eternal splendor of creation.

                     The First Creation
       12. After we have considered the universe from the general
points of view concerning its composition, laws and properties, we
can extend our study to the mode of formation that has given birth
to the worlds and beings. Let us go back at this time to the creation
of the earth in particular and its current state in the universality
of things, and from there, taking it as a starting point and relative
unit, we will proceed to our planetary and sidereal studies.


                                  120

                         General Uranography


       13. If we have rightly understood the relationship, or rather,
the opposition between eternity and time; if we have familiarized
ourselves with the idea that time is only a relative measure of the
succession of transitory things, whereas eternity is essentially one,
immovable, permanent and unsusceptible to any measurement
from the point of view of duration, we will realize that for eternity
there is neither beginning nor end.
       On the other hand, if we get an exact idea – although
necessarily very weak – of the infinitude of divine power, we will
understand how it is possible that the universe always has been and
always will be. Ever since God has existed, his eternal perfections
have also existed and have been articulated. Before time was
born, incommensurable eternity received the divine word and
impregnated space, eternal as the divine word itself.
       14. God, by his nature having existed from all eternity, has
created from all eternity, and it could not have been any other way.
If such were not the case, no matter how far back in time we go
through our imagination to the supposed limits of creation, there
would always remain, beyond those limits, an eternity – ponder
this thought well – an eternity during which the divine hypostases,
the infinite volitions, would have been entombed in inactive and
infertile mute lethargy, an eternity of seeming death for the eternal
Father who gives life to beings, of an indifferent muteness for the
Word that governs them, and of a cold and selfish sterility for the
Spirit of love and vivification.
       Let us grasp more fully the grandeur of the divine action and
its perpetuity at the hand of the absolute Being! God is the sun
of his creatures; he is the light of the world. Now, the appearing
of the sun instantly gives birth to the waves of light that spread
everywhere throughout the expanse of space, and in the same way,
the universe, born from the Eternal, dates back to unimaginable
periods of infinite duration to the Fiat lux! of the beginning.

                                121

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


       15. The absolute beginning of things thus goes back to God.
Their successive appearances in the realm of existence comprise
the order of ongoing creation.
       What mortal could tell of the unknown and superbly veiled
glories under the night of the ages, glories that developed during
those ancient times when none of the marvels of the current
universe existed; in that primitive epoch when, the voice of the
Lord having made itself heard, the materials that in the future
would be arranged symmetrically and by themselves to form the
temple of nature suddenly encountered one another in the bosom
of the infinite void; in the moment when, at the sound of that
mysterious voice, which each creature worships and cherishes as
that of a mother’s, harmoniously varied notes were produced to
vibrate together and modulate the concert of the vast heavens!
       The world in its cradle was not yet established in its virility
and fullness of life. No. The creative power never contradicts itself,
and like all things, the universe was born as an infant. Endowed
with the above-referenced laws and the initial impulse inherent to
its formation, the primitive cosmic matter gives birth successively
to vortices, agglomerations of that diffuse fluid, and accumulations
of nebulous matter that were divided and modified ad infinitum
to generate diverse centers of simultaneous or successive creations
in the incommensurable regions of the expanse.
       Due to the forces that predominated over one or the other,
and due to the ulterior circumstances that presided over their
development, these primitive centers became the focal points of
a special life: some points, less disseminated in space and richer
in principles and active energies, began their individual stellar life
at that time; others, occupying an unlimited expanse, grew with
extreme slowness or divided anew into other secondary centers.
      16. Transporting ourselves back only a few million
centuries before the current epoch, our earth did not yet exist, nor

                                 122

                         General Uranography


had our solar system yet begun the evolutions of planetary life.
Nevertheless, splendid suns already illumined the ether; inhabited
planets already gave life and existence to a multitude of beings
that preceded us in the human course; under the gaze of other
eyes, opulent productions of an unknown nature and marvelous
phenomena of the heavens comprised the scenes of an immense
creation. What am I saying! Already, splendors that used to make
the hearts of other mortals beat under the thought of the infinite
power were no more! And we, poor tiny beings, who have come
after an eternity of life, believe ourselves to be contemporaneous
with creation!
       Once more, let us comprehend nature more fully. Let us
realize that eternity lies before as well as after us, that space is
the theater of an unimaginable sequence and simultaneity of
creations. Those nebulae, which we can barely make out in the
farthest reaches of space, are clusters of suns in the process of
formation; those others are galaxies of inhabited worlds; and still
others are the sites of catastrophes or decline. Let us be aware that,
just as we are placed in the midst of an infinity of worlds, we are
also in the midst of a two-fold infinity of previous and subsequent
duration; that universal creation is not restricted to us, and that
we cannot apply that word [restricted] to the isolated formation
of our tiny globe.

                The Universal Creation
       17. After having gone back – human limitations
notwithstanding – to the hidden fount from which worlds derive like
drops of water flowing from a river, let us consider the progression
of the successive creations and their serial developments.
       The primitive cosmic matter contained the material,
fluidic and vital elements for all the universes that unroll their


                                 123

                                     Genesis - Chapter VI


magnificence before eternity. It is the fertile mother of all things,
the first grandmother, and what is more, the eternal generatrix.
This substance from which all the sidereal globes have come
has not disappeared; this power is not dead, for it still gives
birth incessantly to new creations, and receives incessantly the
reconstituted elements of the worlds that have been effaced from
the book of eternity.
       The ethereal matter, rarified to various degrees, and which
is diffused throughout interplanetary space; that cosmic fluid
that fills the universe, rarified to various degrees in the immense
regions rich in clusters of stars; condensed to various degrees
where the stellar sky does not yet shine; modified to various
degrees by different combinations according to their locations
in the expanse, is nothing more than the primitive substance in
which reside the universal forces, from which nature has taken
all things.29
       18. This fluid penetrates bodies like an immense ocean.
In it resides the vital principle that gives rise to the life of beings
and perpetuates it on each globe according to its condition, a
principle which in its latent state lies dormant as long as no
voice calls upon it. By virtue of this universal vital principle,
every creature, mineral, plant, animal or other – because there
are many other kingdoms of nature whose existence you do not
even suspect – knows how to appropriate the conditions for its
existence and lifespan.
       Mineral molecules have their portion of this life too, just
like the seed and the embryo, and, like in the organism, they group
together in symmetrical figures that constitute individualities.
29
     If one were to ask what the beginning of these forces was and how such beginning could
      be in the very substance that produced it, we would respond that mechanics offers
      numerous examples. Is not elasticity, which enables a spring to be stretched, in the spring
      itself and does it not depend on the way the molecules are arranged? Bodies that obey the
      centrifugal force receive their impulse from the first movement exerted on them. – Auth.

       It is very important to be aware of the idea that the primitive
cosmic matter is endowed not only with the laws that ensure the
stability of the worlds, but also with the universal vital principle
that forms the spontaneous generations on each world to the extent
that conditions manifest for the successive existence of beings, and
when the hour sounds for the appearing of the children of life
during the creation period.
       This is how the universal creation has been accomplished.
Hence, it is correct to say that, since the workings of nature are the
expression of the divine will, God has always created, continues to
create, and will create forever.
       19. Up to this point, we have remained silent about the
spirit world, which is also a part of creation and fulfills its destiny
according to the august prescriptions of the Lord.
       Concerning the way in which spirits are created, I can
provide only a very restricted teaching due to my own ignorance,
and, moreover, I must keep silent regarding certain issues, although
I myself have been allowed to delve into them.
       To those who are piously desirous to understand, and
who are humble before God, I will say, begging them not to
base any premature theory on my words: the spirit does not
receive divine illumination, which gives it, along with free will
and consciousness, the awareness of its higher destiny, without
having passed through the divinely unavoidable series of lower
beings, among which the labor of its individualization is slowly
worked out. It is only from the day when the Lord imprints on
its brow his august seal that the spirit takes its place in the ranks
of humankind.
       Once more, do not build your ideas upon my words, so
sadly celebrated in the history of metaphysics; I would a thousand
times prefer to remain silent about such lofty issues, which are far
above our ordinary ponderings, than to lead you to distort the

                                 125

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


meaning of my teaching, and immerse you, through my fault, in
the inextricable maze of deism or fatalism.

                     Suns and Planets
       20. Now, at some point in the universe, lost among the
myriads of worlds, the cosmic matter condenses into the form of
a huge nebula. This nebula is animated by the universal laws that
govern matter. In virtue of these laws – most notably the molecular
force of attraction – it takes the shape of a spheroid, the only one
that a mass of matter isolated in space can assume.
       The circular movement, produced by the strictly equal
gravity of all the molecular zones toward the center, soon modifies
this primitive sphere to lead it, movement by movement, to the
lenticular shape (we speak of the nebula as a whole).
       21. Two new forces have arisen as a result of this rotational
movement: centripetal force and centrifugal force, the former
trying to pull all the zones to the center, the latter trying to move
them away. Now, with the movement accelerating as the nebula
condenses, and its radius increasing as it approaches the lenticular
shape, the centrifugal force incessantly developed by these two
causes soon predominates over the attraction at the center.
       In the same way that a very fast movement of the sling
breaks the cord and sets the projectile free to a great distance,
the predominance of the centrifugal force detaches the equatorial
circle from the nebula and from this ring forms a new mass
isolated from the first, although subject to its control. This
mass retains its equatorial movement, which, when modified,
will become its movement of translation around the solar body.
Furthermore, its new state gives it a rotational movement around
its own center.


                                 126

                         General Uranography


       22. The generatrix nebula, which gave birth to this new
world, has condensed and retaken its spherical shape. However,
since the primitive heat developed by its diverse movements
weakens extremely slowly, the phenomenon we have just described
will be reproduced frequently and over an extended period as long
as the nebula does not become dense or solid enough to offer any
effective resistance to the modifications of shape that its movement
of rotation successively imprints on it.
       Consequently, the nebula will have given birth not to one
heavenly body only, but to hundreds of worlds detached from the
focal center, having sprung from the nebula through the mode of
formation mentioned above. Now, each of these worlds, endowed
like the original world with the natural forces that preside over
the creation of universes, will engender subsequent new globes
gravitating henceforth around it, just as it itself gravitates
concurrently with its siblings around the focal point of their
existence and life. Each one of these worlds will be a sun, the center
of a vortex of planets exiting successively from its equator. These
planets will receive a special, individual life, though dependent on
the star that generated them.
       23. Thus, planets are formed from masses of condensed
matter that has not yet solidified, detached from the central mass
by the action of centrifugal force, and by virtue of the laws of
movement, taking on a spheroid shape that is more elliptical or
less so, depending on the degree of fluidity they have retained.
One of these planets will be Earth, which, before being cooled off
and covered with a solid crust, will give birth to the moon through
the same process of astral formation to which it owes its own
existence. The earth, henceforth inscribed in the book of life, will
be the cradle for creatures whose weakness is protected under the
wings of Divine Providence, a new string in the infinite harp that
must resound in its place in the universal concert of the worlds.

                                 127

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


                             Moons
       24. Before the planetary masses had attained a degree of
cooling sufficient for their solidification, smaller masses, veritable
liquid globules, became detached from some at the equatorial
plane, where the centrifugal force is greatest, and by virtue of
the same laws, acquired a movement of translation around their
generating planet, as had occurred with those planets around their
generating central star.
       This is how the earth gave birth to its moon, whose
considerably lesser mass underwent a more rapid cooling. Now
then, the laws and forces that presided over its detachment
from the earth’s equator and its movement of translation on
the same plane acted in such a way that, instead of taking on
a spheroid shape, it took on the shape of an ovoid globe, i.e.,
the elongated shape of an egg, whose center of gravity would be
fixed in the lower part.
       25. The conditions under which the detachment of the
moon was effected allowed it barely to pull away from the earth,
and constrained it to remain perpetually suspended in earth’s sky
like an ovoid figure, whose heaviest parts formed the lower face
turned toward the earth, and whose less dense parts comprised the
top, if one means the side opposite the earth and pointed toward
the heavens. This is what makes this heavenly body always show
the same side to us. To better understand its geological state, it can
be pictured as being a ball of cork, whose base, turned toward the
earth, would be made of lead.
       Thus, there are two essentially distinct natures to the moon’s
surface: one without any possible similarity to ours because
its fluidic and ethereal bodies are unknown; the other, light in
relation to the earth, since all the less-dense substances settled in


                                 128

                                     General Uranography


that hemisphere. The former, perpetually turned toward the earth,
without water or atmosphere, except maybe here and there at the
boundaries of this sub-terrestrial hemisphere; the latter, rich in
fluids, perpetually turned away from our world.30
      26. The number and state of the moons of each planet
varied in accordance with the special conditions under which they
were formed. Some planets did not give birth to any secondary
heavenly body, as is the case of Mercury, Venus and Mars,31 while
others like Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., formed one or more.
      27. Besides its own satellites or moons, the planet Saturn
displays the special phenomenon of its ring system32, which, seen
from afar, appears to encircle it like a white aureole. This formation
is a new demonstration of the universality of the laws of nature.
The ring is actually the result of a separation effectuated on Saturn’s
30
     This entirely new theory about the moon explains, through the law of gravity, the
     reason why this heavenly body always shows the same face to the earth. Its center
     of gravity, instead of being at the center of the sphere, rests on one of the points on
     its surface, and consequently, attracted toward the earth by a force greater than the
     lighter parts, the moon would produce the effect of one of those figures commonly
     called poussahs [Roly Polies or Bop Bags in the U.S. – Tr.], whose heavier base makes
     them always pop right back up, whereas the planets, whose center of gravity is at equal
     distances from their surface, turn regularly on their axis. The gaseous or liquid vivifying
     fluids, as a consequence of their specific lightness, would be found accumulated in the
     upper hemisphere continuously turned away from the earth. The lower hemisphere
     (the only one we see) would be devoid of such fluids, and therefore inappropriate for
     life, while it would reign on the other. Hence, if the upper hemisphere is inhabited, its
     inhabitants have never seen the earth, unless they traveled to the other hemisphere,
     something impossible for them if there are no conditions indispensable to life. As
     rational and scientific as this theory may be, since it cannot yet be confirmed by any
     direct observation, it can be accepted only as a hypothesis and as an idea that can serve
     as a reference to science. It must be agreed that it is the only one at this time that gives
     a satisfactory explanation for the particularities this globe displays. – Auth.

     This was written before the 1877 discovery of the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos – Tr.
32
     The rings of Saturn have puzzled astronomers since Galileo Galilei discovered them with his
     telescope in 1610. Detailed study by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s
     only increased the mystery. There are thousands of rings made of up billions of particles
     of ice and rock. The particles range in size from a grain of sugar to the size of a house. The
     rings are believed to be pieces of comets, asteroids or shattered moons that broke up
     before they reached the planet. Each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.

equator in primitive times, in the same way that an equatorial zone
escaped the earth to form its satellite. The difference is that Saturn’s
ring is formed in all of its parts of homogenous molecules, probably
already in a certain degree of condensation, and could thereby
continue its rotational movement in the same way and within a time
almost equal to that which animates the planet. If one of the points of
this ring had been denser than another, one or many agglomerations
of substances would have suddenly occurred and Saturn would have
had many more moons. Since the time of its formation, this ring has
solidified in the same way as the other planetary bodies.

                             Comets
       28. Wandering heavenly bodies – even more so than the
planets that have retained that etymological label – comets are
the guides that will help us cross the boundaries of the system to
which the earth belongs in order to carry us to far-off regions in
the sidereal expanse.
       But before exploring the heavenly realms with the aid of
these travelers of the universe, it would be good to understand –
as much as possible – their intrinsic nature and their role in the
planetary economy.
       29. These bearded heavenly bodies have often been seen as
being infant worlds, brewing in their primordial chaos the conditions
for life and existence that are bestowed on the inhabited worlds.
Others have imagined these extraordinary bodies to be worlds in
a state of destruction, and for many, their striking appearance has
been the subject of erroneous speculation concerning their nature,
so much so that, even in judicial astrology, some used to regard
them as portents of disasters sent by providential decrees to the
astonished and trembling earth.


                                  130

                         General Uranography


       30. The law of variety is applied with such great profusion
in the works of nature that one wonders how naturalists,
astronomers and philosophers could have erected so many theories
to give comets a status equivalent to planetary bodies, and to see
them as nothing but heavenly bodies in a greater or lesser degree
of development or decay. However, the pictures of nature should
be ample enough to keep the observer from the need to look for
relationships that do not exist, and to leave to comets the humble
but useful role of wandering heavenly bodies serving as scouts for
the solar domains. Because the heavenly bodies of which they are
made are altogether different from that of planetary bodies, they
do not have, like them, the purpose of serving as dwellings for
humanities. They travel successively from sun to sun, enriching
themselves at times with planetary fragments reduced to the
state of vapor, drawing to themselves the vivifying and renewing
principles that they shed over terrestrial worlds. (chap. IX, no. 12)
       31. If, when one of those heavenly bodies approaches our
tiny globe to traverse its orbit and return to its apogee located at
an incommensurable distance from the sun, we were to follow it
through thought to visit with it the sidereal regions, we would cross
this prodigious expanse of ethereal matter that separates the sun
from the closest stars, and in observing the combined movements
of this heavenly body – which we could imagine as being astray in
the desert of the infinite – we would find there another eloquent
proof of the universality of the laws of nature carried out at
distances that the most active imagination can hardly conceive.
       There, the elliptical form takes on the parabolic form and
its progress is slowed down to the point that the comet travels
only a few yards in the same amount of time which, at its perigee,
it traveled many thousands of miles. Perhaps a more powerful
sun, more important than the one that it has just left behind, will
exercise over this comet a preponderant attraction and receive it

                                131

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


into the ranks of its own subjects, and then the confused children
of your tiny earth will wait in vain for its return, which they
had predicted through incomplete observations. In that case,
we, whose thought has followed the wandering comet in those
unknown regions, will encounter a new nation, impossible for
earthly eyes to find, unimaginable for the spirits who inhabit the
earth, inconceivable even to their thought, because it will be the
theater of unexplored marvels.
       We have arrived at the stellar world, that dazzling world of
vast suns which radiate in infinite space, and which are the brilliant
flowers of the magnificent grounds of creation. Only there will we
know what the earth is.

                      The Milky Way
       32. On beautiful, moonless, starry nights, everyone can see
that whitish glow which crosses the heavens from one end to the
other, and which the ancients dubbed the Milky Way due to its
milky appearance. That diffuse glow has long been explored in
modern times by the eye of the telescope, and that path of gold
dust, or that stream of milk of ancient mythology, has become a
vast field of unknown marvels. The research of observers has led to
the understanding of its nature, and has revealed that there, where
the eye gets lost and would encounter only a weak luminosity,
there are millions of suns more luminous and important than the
one that illuminates us.
      33. In fact, the Milky Way is a prairie sown with solar or
planetary flowers that shine throughout it enormous expanse.
Our sun and all the bodies that accompany it are part of those
resplendent orbs that form the Milky Way. However, the sun,
notwithstanding its gigantic proportions in relation to earth and


                                 132

                                       General Uranography


the magnitude of its domain, occupies only an inappreciable dot
in this vast creation. One can count some thirty million similar
suns gravitating in that immense region at a distance from each
other greater than one hundred thousand times the radius of the
earth’s orbit.33 34
       34. By this approximate calculation one can judge the
extent of that sidereal region and the relation that unites our
system to the universality of other systems that occupy it. One
can also judge the smallness of the sun’s domain; even more so, the
nothingness of our tiny earth. What would earth be, then, if one
were to consider the beings that people the Milky Way!
       I say “nothingness” because our determinations apply
not only to the material and physical extent of the bodies we
are studying – that would not be much – but also and above all
to their moral state as a place, and the rank they occupy in the
eternal hierarchy of beings. Creation is displayed there in all its
majesty, engendering and propagating the manifestations of life
and intelligence all around the solar world and in each one of the
systems that surround it on all sides.
       35. In this way, one can understand the position occupied
by our sun or the earth in the world of stars. Such considerations
will carry even more weight if one were to reflect on the status of
the Milky Way itself, which, in the immensity of sidereal creations,
represents only an unperceivable and unappreciable point when
seen from afar, because it is nothing more than one stellar nebula
among the thousands existing in space. If it seems vaster and richer
to us than others, it is only because it surrounds us and unfolds

     Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle. The earth is slightly closer to the sun in early January and
     farther away in July. In January, the earth is 91.4 million miles (147.1 million kilometers)
     from the sun, and in July it is 94.5 million miles (152.1 million kilometers) away. Source:

in all its reaches before our eyes, whereas the others, lost in the
unfathomable depths, barely let themselves be glimpsed.
       36. Well, if one knows that the earth is nothing or almost
nothing within the solar system; the solar system is nothing or
almost nothing within the Milky Way; the Milky Way is nothing
or almost nothing within the universality of nebulae, and because
this universality is itself a very small thing within the immense
infinite, one will begin to understand what the terrestrial globe is.

                       The Fixed Stars
       37. The so-called “fixed” stars that constellate the two
hemispheres of the firmament are not isolated from all outside
attraction, as is generally assumed. Far from it: they all belong to one
and the same agglomeration of stellar bodies. This agglomeration
is nothing other than a large nebula of which we are part, and
whose equatorial plane, projected throughout the sky, has received
the name “Milky Way.” All the suns comprising it are in solidarity;
their multiple influences continually react upon each other and
universal gravity unites all of them in the same family.
      38. Among those diverse suns, most are like ours, encircled
by secondary worlds that they illuminate and support by means
of the same laws that preside over life in our own planetary
system. Some, like Sirius, are thousands of times richer and more
magnificent in size than ours, and their role in the universe is more
important, just as the planets that revolve around them are greater
in number and far more advanced than ours. Others are very
dissimilar in their stellar functions. It is thus that a certain number
of these suns, true twins in the sidereal order, are accompanied
by their same-aged siblings and form in space dual systems, to
which nature has given functions that are different than those


                                  134

                                    General Uranography


pertaining to our sun.35 There, years are no longer measured by
the same periods, or the days by the same suns, and those worlds,
illuminated by a double torch, have received as their inheritance
conditions of an existence unimaginable to those who have not left
this tiny terrestrial world.
       Other stars, without entourage and deprived of planets,
have received better elements of habitability than those granted to
others. In their immensity, the laws of nature are diversified and if
unity is the grand word of the universe, infinite diversity is no less
its eternal attribute.
      39. In spite of the prodigious number of these stars and their
systems, and despite the incommensurable distances that separate
them, they all nonetheless belong to the same stellar nebula, which
the eyes of the most powerful telescopes can barely traverse and
which the most daring conceptions of the imagination can barely
reach. Nevertheless, this nebula is only one unit in the order of the
nebulae that comprise the stellar world.
      40. The so-called fixed stars are not immovable in the
expanse. The constellations that have been imagined in the
canopy of the firmament are not at all real symbolic creations.
Their distance from the earth and the perspective from which the
universe is measured from this station are the two causes for this
two-fold optical illusion (Chap. V, No. 12).


35
     In astronomy, these have been labeled “binary stars.” They are two suns that revolve
     around each other like a planet around its sun. What a peculiar and magnificent
     show must be enjoyed by the inhabitants of the worlds that comprise these systems
     illuminated by a binary sun! But also, how different the conditions of life must be there!
     In a later communication, the spirit of Galileo added: “There are also systems that are
     more complicated, in which different suns play, face to face with each other, the role
     of moons. Thus, they produce marvelous light shows for the inhabitants of the globes
     they illuminate. In fact, despite their apparent proximity, inhabited worlds can revolve
     between them and alternately receive diversely-colored light waves, which combine to
     form white light.” – Auth.

       41. We have seen that the totality of the heavenly bodies
that sparkle in the bluish dome is enclosed within one and the
same cosmic agglomeration, within one and the same nebula that
you call the Milky Way. However, despite belonging to the same
group, each one of these heavenly bodies is nonetheless animated
by its own movement of translation through space. Absolute repose
does not exist anywhere. They are governed by the universal laws of
gravitation and they roll through the expanse under the incessant
impulse of that immense force. They do not at all roll along random
routes, but along set orbits whose center is occupied by a much
larger heavenly body. To make my words more comprehensible
through an example, I will speak specifically of your sun.
        42. Through modern observations, it is known that the sun
has neither a fixed nor central place as was believed in the early days
of the new astronomy, but that it travels through space, carrying
along with it its vast system of planets, moons and comets.
        This journey is not fortuitous and the sun does not wander
around the infinite void, led astray from the regions assigned to
it, its children and its subjects. No, its orbit is measured, and
concurrently with other suns of the same order and surrounded
by a certain number of inhabited planets, it gravitates around a
central sun. Its gravitational movement, like that of its sister suns,
is imperceptible to annual observations, because a large number of
century-long periods would hardly be sufficient to mark out the
time of one such stellar year.
       43. The central sun of which we speak is itself a secondary
globe with respect to another still more important one, around
which it continues a slow and measured journey in the company
of other suns of the same order.
       We could dwell on this successive subordination of suns to
other suns until our imagination becomes weary of climbing up such


                                 136

                         General Uranography


a hierarchy, but let us not forget that we can count in round numbers
some thirty million suns in the Milky Way that are subordinate to
one another like gigantic cogwheels of an immense system.
      44. And these heavenly bodies, uncountable in number,
each live a life in solidarity with the others; in the same way that
nothing is isolated in the economy of your tiny terrestrial world, so
also nothing is isolated in the incommensurable universe.
      Such systems of systems would appear from afar to the
investigative eye of the philosopher who could grasp the picture
developed by space and time as dust of golden pearls lifted into
vortexes by the divine breath, which makes the sidereal worlds fly
through the heavens like grains of sand on the dunes of the desert.
      More stillness, more silence, more nightfall! The grand
spectacle of the kind that would unfold before our eyes would
be the real creation, immense and full of the ethereal life that
embraces in its immense whole the infinite gaze of the Creator.
      However, up to this point we have spoken only about one
nebula; its millions of suns, its millions of inhabited worlds, as we
have said, form only one island in the infinite archipelago.

                  The Deserts of Space
       45. An immense unbounded desert extends beyond and
envelops the agglomeration of stars that we have been discussing.
Solitude follows solitude, and the incommensurable plains of the
void extend in the distance. Masses of cosmic matter are found
isolated in space like floating islands of an enormous archipelago.
If in some way one would want to surmise the enormous distance
that separates the agglomeration of stars of which we are part
from the agglomerations that are closest to us, one would have to
understand that these stellar islands are scattered and rare in the


                                137

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


vast ocean of the heavens, and that the expanse that separates them
from each other is incomparably greater than the measurement of
their respective dimensions.
       Now, let us remember that the stellar nebula measures in
rounded-off numbers one thousand times the distance to the
closest star taken as a unit, that is, some one hundred thousand
trillion leagues [one league is three miles]. Being much vaster,
the distance that extends between them cannot be expressed by
numbers accessible to the comprehension of our minds; only the
imagination in its highest conceptions is capable of overcoming
that prodigious immensity – those solitudes mute and deprived of
all appearance of life – and conceiving in some way an idea of this
relative infinity.
      46. This celestial desert, however, which envelops our
sidereal universe and which seems to extend itself as the far-off
confines of our stellar world, is embraced by the vision and infinite
power of the Most High, who, beyond the heavens of our skies,
has developed the framework of his unlimited creation.
      47. Indeed, beyond such vast areas of isolation, worlds
radiate in their magnificence as much as they do in the regions
that are accessible to human examination. Beyond these deserts,
splendid oases float in the limpid ether and ceaselessly renew the
marvelous settings of existence and life. There, far-off aggregations
of cosmic substance unfold, which the keen eye of the telescope
glimpses through the transparent regions of our sky: those nebulae
that you call irresolvable, and which seem to you like light clouds
of white powder lost in an unknown point of ethereal space.
There, new worlds are revealed and developed, whose varied and
unfamiliar conditions, different from those inherent to your globe,
give them a life that your conceptions cannot imagine, nor your
studies ascertain. It is there that the creative power glows in all its


                                 138

                                     General Uranography


fullness. To someone who comes from the regions occupied by
your system, where forces of other laws are in action governing the
manifestations of life, the new path that we follow in these foreign
regions opens unknown perspectives to us.36

     In astronomy, the name irresolvable nebulae is given to those in which the stars comprising
     them cannot yet be distinguished. They had at first been considered as accumulations of
     cosmic matter in the process of condensation to form worlds, but today it is generally
     thought that such appearance is due to their distance, and that with sufficiently powerful
     instruments, they would all be solvable.
     Though very imperfect, a familiar comparison can provide an idea about solvable nebulae:
     these are like groups of sparks projected by fireworks at the moment they explode. Each
     one of these sparks would represent a star and the group would be the nebula or group
     of stars gathered at a point in space and subject to a common law of attraction and
     movement. Seen at a certain distance, these sparks can barely be distinguished, and their
     group has the appearance of a tiny cloud of smoke. This comparison would not be precise
     if it dealt with masses of condensed cosmic matter.
     Our Milky Way is one of such nebula; it contains almost 30 million stars or suns that now
     occupy no less than some hundreds of trillions of leagues of expanse; nonetheless, it is not
     the largest. Let us suppose only an average of 20 planets revolving around each sun: that
     would make about 600 million worlds just in our group.
     If we could travel from our nebula to another, there we would be as if in the midst of our
     Milky Way, but with a starry sky of a completely different appearance, which, in spite of
     its colossal dimensions in relation to us, would seem in the distance like a tiny lenticular
     flake lost in the infinite. But before reaching the new nebula, we would be like a traveler
     who leaves a city and travels through a vast uninhabited country before arriving at another
     city. We would have crossed incommensurable spaces devoid of stars and worlds, which
     Galileo calls the deserts of space. As we proceed, we would see our own nebula receding
     behind us, decreasing in size to our eyes at the same time that the one toward which we are
     traveling becomes more and more distinct, similar to the mass of sparks from the fireworks
     shell. As we traveled through thought to the regions of space beyond the archipelago of
     our own nebula, we would see all around us millions of similar archipelagos of different
     shapes, each containing millions of suns and hundreds of millions of inhabited worlds.
     Everything that might identify us with the immensity of the expanse and the structure
     of the universe is useful for broadening our ideas, so restricted by common beliefs. God
     grows before our eyes to the degree that we better comprehend the grandeur of his works
     and our insignificance. We have come a long way, as one can see, from the belief instilled
     by the Mosaic Genesis, which makes our tiny, imperceptible earth the main creation of
     God, and its inhabitants the sole objects of his solicitude. We understand the vanity of
     those who believe that everything in the universe was made for them, and of those who
     dare dispute the existence of the Supreme Being. Within a few centuries, one will be
     astonished that a religion made to glorify God lowered God to such petty proportions,
     and that it rejected as being the conception of the spirit of evil the discoveries that could

          The Eternal Succession of Worlds
      48. We have seen that a unique, primordial and general law
has been bestowed on the universe to ensure its eternal stability,
and that this general law is perceptible to our senses through
various particular actions, which we call the guiding forces of
nature. Today, we are going to show that the harmony of the entire
world, considered from the dual aspect of eternity and space, is
secured by this supreme law.
       49. In fact, if we went back to the early origin of the original
agglomerations of cosmic substance, we would notice that, under
the rule of this law, matter is already undergoing the necessary
transformations that lead it from the seed to the ripe fruit, and
that, under the impulse of the various forces born from this law,
it moves along the scale of its periodic revolutions: first, a fluidic
center of motion; next, a generator of worlds; later, a central and
attractive nucleus of spheres that were born in its midst.
       We already know that those laws presided over the history of
the cosmos. What is now important to know is that they also preside
over the destruction of heavenly bodies, because death is not only
a metamorphosis of the living being, but also a transformation of
inanimate matter. And if it is true to say literally that life is only
accessible to the scythe of death, it is also correct to add that in the
case of matter it too must necessarily undergo the transformations
inherent to its constitution.
      50. Take a world which, ever since its primitive cradle,
has strode the entire span of years that its special organization

 only increase our admiration of God’s omnipotence by initiating us into the magnificent
 mysteries of creation. One will be astonished even further at becoming aware that these
 discoveries were rejected because they would have emancipated the spirit of humankind
 and eradicated the preponderance of those who called themselves the representatives of
 God on earth. – Auth.

allowed. The inner core of its existence has become extinct and
its elements have lost their initial capability. The phenomena of
nature, demanding for their production the presence and action of
the forces assigned to this world, henceforth can no longer present
themselves, because the lever of their activity no longer has the
fulcrum that gave it all its power.
       Now, would one think that this extinct and lifeless world
would continue to gravitate within celestial space without purpose
and become useless ash in the vortex of the heavens? Would one
think that it will remain written in the book of universal life when
it has become no more than a dead letter empty of all meaning? No.
The same laws that raised it up from the dark chaos and endowed
it with the splendors of life, the same forces which governed it
throughout the centuries of its adolescence, which consolidated
the first steps of its existence and which led it to adulthood and
old age, will preside over the disaggregation of its constitutive
elements in order to turn them over to the laboratory whence
the creative power unceasingly draws the conditions for general
stability. These elements will return to the common mass of the
ether to be assimilated into other bodies or to regenerate other
suns; and such death will not be a pointless event for either this
world or its siblings. In other regions it will renew other creations
of a different nature, and there, where the systems of worlds have
vanished, a new flowerbed of more brilliant and fragrant flowers
will soon be born.
      51. Thus, the real and effective eternity of the universe is
ensured by the same laws that direct the operations of time; this
way, worlds succeed worlds and suns succeed suns, without the
immense mechanism of the vast heavens being ever reached in its
gigantic workings.
      There, where your eyes admire the splendid stars in the
canopy of the night; there, where your mind contemplates

                                141

                                     Genesis - Chapter VI


magnificent radiances that shine from far away places, the finger
of death has long extinguished many such splendors; the void has
long succeeded such radiances and even received new creations yet
unknown. The immense distance of these heavenly bodies, over
which the light they have sent has taken thousands of years to
reach us, means that today we are only receiving rays that they
sent long before the creation of the earth, and which we will still
admire for thousands of years after their actual disappearance.37
       What are the six thousand years of historical humanity
compared with the eons? Like seconds in your centuries? What are
your astronomical observations compared with the absolute state
of the world? A shadow eclipsed by the sun.
      52. Hence, here, as in our other studies, let us realize
that the earth and humankind are nothing compared to what is,
and that the most colossal efforts of our thought cover but an
imperceptible area in light of the immensity and eternity of a
universe that will never end.
      And when these periods of our immortality will have passed
over our heads, when the current history of the earth will have
looked to us like a vaporous mist in the depths of our memory,
when we will have inhabited for uncountable centuries the
various degrees of our cosmological hierarchy, and when the most
distant domains of future ages will have been traveled by us in
innumerable pilgrimages, the unlimited succession of worlds and
the immovable eternity will still lie before us as our perspective.


37
     Here is the result of the time that it takes light to travel through space. Since its velocity
     is 70,000 leagues per second [a league equals 3 miles], it reaches us from the sun in 8
     minutes and 13 seconds. Thus, if a phenomenon occurred on the sun’s surface, we would
     not perceive it until 8 minutes later, and for the same reason, we would still see the event 8
     minutes after it had ceased. If because of its distance the light of a star took one thousand
     years to reach us, we would see the star only one thousand years after its formation (For
     a complete explanation and description of this phenomenon, see Revue Spirite, Mar. and
     May of 1867, pp. 93 and 151, account rendered in Lumen, by C. Flammarion) – Auth.

                          Universal Life
       53. The immortality of souls, of which the system of the
physical world is the foundation, has seemed fanciful to the eye
of certain prejudiced thinkers. Ironically, they have classified it as
vagrant immortality and have not understood that it is true only
in light of the spectacle of the creation. Nevertheless, it is possible
to make all its grandeur understood – I would say even further,
nearly all its perfection.
      54. That the works of God are created for thought
and intelligence, that the worlds are dwellings for beings who
contemplate them and discover behind their veil the power and
wisdom of the One who forms them – this issue is no longer in
doubt; however, that the souls who populate them are in solidarity
with one another, this is what is important to understand.
        55. Indeed, the human mind finds it difficult to consider
those radiant globes that sparkle in the expanse as simple masses of
inert, lifeless matter. It also finds it difficult to think that there are, in
such distant regions, magnificent twilights and splendorous nights,
fertile suns and days filled with light, and valleys and mountains,
where the multiple productions of nature have unfolded in all
their luxurious splendor. It is hard for them to imagine, I would
say, that the divine spectacle, wherein the soul can re-temper itself,
may be deprived of any existence or any thinking being that could
acknowledge it.
      56. But to this eminently just idea of creation it is necessary
to add that of the solidarity of humankind, and therein lies the
mystery of future eternity.
      One and the same human family has been created in the
universality of worlds, and the ties of a fraternity still inappreciable
by you have been bestowed on these worlds. If these heavenly bodies,

                                     143

                          Genesis - Chapter VI


which are harmonized in their vast systems, are inhabited by intelligent
beings, it is not at all by beings unknown to one another, but rather,
by beings marked on their brow by the same destiny, and who must
meet one another momentarily according to their life functions and
meet again according to their mutual affinities; it is the great family
of spirits who populate the celestial lands; it is the great radiance
of the Divine Spirit who embraces the expanse of the heavens and
who remains as the first and final archetype of spiritual perfection.
       57. By what odd aberration have we believed we should
deny immortality to the vast regions of the ether, containing it
within an inadmissible boundary and within an absolute duality?
Should not a true theory of the world therefore precede true
dogmatic doctrine, and should not science precede theology? Will
it deviate so much as to establish its basis on metaphysics? The
answer is simple and shows us that the new philosophy will sit
triumphantly upon the ruins of the old, because its foundation
will be victoriously erected upon ancient errors.

                The Diversity of Worlds
      58. You have accompanied us on our celestial excursions
and you have visited with us the immense regions of space. Under
our eyes, suns have succeeded suns, systems have succeeded
systems, and nebulae have succeeded nebulae. The splendid
panorama of the harmony of the cosmos has unfolded before our
steps and we have received a foretaste of the idea of the infinite,
which only with our future perfectibility will we be able to
comprehend in its full extent. The mysteries of the ether have
disclosed their enigmas, till now undecipherable, and we at least
have conceived of the idea of the universality of things. Now it is
important for us to pause and reflect.


                                  144

       59. Without a doubt, it is good to have realized the smallness
of the earth and its mediocre importance in the hierarchy of worlds.
It is good to have struck down the human presumption that is
so dear to us, and to have humbled ourselves before the absolute
grandeur; however, it will be better still to morally interpret the
spectacle that we have witnessed. I would like to speak of the
infinite power of nature and the idea we ought to have about its
mode of action in the diverse parts of the vast universe.
       60. Accustomed as we are to judging things by our poor,
small dwelling place, we imagine that nature could not or must
not have acted on other worlds except according to the rules
that we recognize down here. Now, it is precisely in this that it is
important for us to reform our judgment.
       Cast your gaze for an instant on any one region of your
globe and on one of the productions of your nature. Do you not
recognize there the seal of an infinite variety and the proof of an
unequaled activity? Do you not see in the wing of a canary or in
the petal of a rosebud in bloom the extraordinary fecundity of
such beautiful nature?
       May your studies be applied to the beings that soar through
the air; may they descend to the violet growing in the woods;
may they break open the depths of the ocean; in everything and
everywhere you will read this universal truth: all-powerful nature
acts according to places, times and circumstances. It is one in its
overall harmony but multiple in its productions. It plays with a
sun as with a drop of water, and it peoples an immense world with
living beings with the same ease that it hatches the egg laid by the
autumn butterfly.
      61. Now then, if such is the variety that nature has been
able to portray to us in all places of this small world, so narrow
and limited, how much broader should you consider this mode


                                145

                         Genesis - Chapter VI


of action when pondering the perspectives of vaster worlds! How
much more developed and lush you must recognize nature to be,
operating in those marvelous worlds which, much more than the
earth, attest to its unknowable perfection!
       Thus, do not see systems similar to your own planetary
system revolving around each one of the suns in space; do not
see on those unknown planets the three kingdoms of nature that
display themselves around you. Instead, think that, just as no
human face looks like any other face in the entire human species,
a prodigious, unimaginable diversity is also manifested in the
ethereal dwelling places that float in the bosom of space.
       From the fact that your animate nature begins with the
zoophyte to culminate with the human being; that the atmosphere
nourishes terrestrial life; that the liquid element constantly renews
it; that your seasons make succeed in this life the phenomena that
divide it up, do not conclude that the millions and millions of
earths that float in the spatial expanse are similar to this one. Far
from it. They differ according to the diverse conditions that have
been assigned to them and according to their respective roles in
the scenario of the universe. They are the diversified jewels in an
immense mosaic, the diverse flowers in a remarkable flowerbed.

   Post-Diluvial or Present Period – The Birth of Humankind



                  The Geological Periods
        1. The earth carries within it the obvious traces of its formation.
The phases can be tracked with mathematical precision in the different
formations that make up its framework. The whole of such studies
composes the science called geology, a science born during this century
[19th], and which has cast light on the highly controversial issue of the
origin of the earth and the living beings inhabiting it. On this point
there is no theory; it is the strict result of the observation of the facts,
and in light of such facts there is no room for doubt. The history of
the globe’s formation is written in the geological strata much more
surely than in preconceived books, because it is nature herself that
speaks, that bares herself, and not the imagination of persons who
create theories. Where one sees the marks of fire, one can safely say
that there has been a fire; where one sees the marks of water, one can


                                    147

                                    Genesis - Chapter VII


no less surely say that there has been water; where one sees marks of
animals, one can say that animals have lived there.
       Geology is thus a completely observational science; it draws
conclusions only from what it sees; on questionable points, it
affirms nothing: it forgoes arguable opinions, waiting for more
complete observations. Without the discoveries of geology – as
without those of astronomy – the world’s genesis would still be dwelling
in the darkness of legend. Thanks to geology, people today know the
history of their habitation, and the scaffolding of the fables that
used to surround its cradle has crumbled, never to rise again.
        2. Everywhere in terrains38 where there are trenches, natural
or man-made excavations, one may observe what are called
stratifications, i.e., superposed strata. The terrains that display
this pattern are designated by the name stratified terrains. These
strata, of highly variable thickness from a few centimeters to 100
meters or more, are distinguished from one another by the color
and nature of the substances composing them. Works of art, the
drilling of wells, quarry operations, and, above all, mines have
made it possible to observe them to a very great depth.
       3. The strata are usually homogenous; that is, each is
formed of the same substance, or of various substances that existed
together and formed a compact whole. The line of demarcation
that separates them from one another is always clearly defined, like
the layers of a foundation of a building; in no part does one see
them mixed and lost in one another at their respective boundaries,
as occurs, for example, in the colors of a prism or a rainbow.
       By these characteristics, one can see that they were formed
successively and were deposited one on top of the other under
different conditions and by different causes. The deepest ones, of

     Terrane or Terrain: A distinctive geologic formation or group of rocks or the area in which
     such features occur. (Webster’s, 1991, op. cit.). – Tr.



                                               148

                              A Geological Sketch of the Earth


course, formed first, and those closer to the surface, afterward. The
last of all of them – that which is found at the surface – is called
the vegetative stratum, which owes its properties to the decayed
remains of organic matter coming from plants and animals.
       4. In geology, the lower layers underneath the vegetative
strata are called rock strata, a name which in this context does not
always imply the idea of a rocky substance, but means a bed or
bank made of some kind of mineral substance. Some are composed
of sand, clay, marl39 or gravel; others are composed of actual stone
of varying hardness, such as sandstone, marble, chalk, limestone or
calcareous rock, grindstone, coal, asphalt, etc. It is said that a rock
is harder or less hard according to its density.
       By examining the nature of these rocks or strata one can
recognize certain signs indicating that some have come from
molten matter, and, at times, vitrified by the action of fire; others,
from earth-like substances deposited by water. Some of these
substances remain disaggregated, such as sand; others, initially in
a pasty state due to the action of certain chemical agents or other
causes, hardened and acquired the consistency of stone over time.
The layers of superposed stone are evidence of successive deposits.
Fire and water therefore have played their part in forming the
materials that compose the solid framework of the globe.
       5. The normal position of the earthy or stony layers coming
from aqueous deposits is horizontal. When one sees those plains,
which at times extend to be lost from view, and which are perfectly
horizontal and compacted as if they had been leveled with a roller,
or those deep valleys that are as flat as the surface of a lake, one can
be certain that at some time in the remote past such places were for
a long time covered by placid waters, which, upon withdrawing,
left dry the soils they had deposited during their stay. When the

                                               149

                                   Genesis - Chapter VII


waters receded, these soils became covered with vegetation. When,
instead of the slimy, limy, clayish or marly soils – so appropriate for
assimilating the nutritive principles – the waters deposited nothing
but silicate sand, which would not agglomerate, we end up with the
sandy, arid plains that make up moors40 and deserts. The sediments
left behind by partial floods and those that form the alluvial deposits
at the mouths of rivers can give a small idea of it.
       6. While the horizontal is the normal and most generalized
position of aqueous formations, one often sees in mountainous
countries rather large expanses of hard rock established on an
inclined and sometimes even vertical position, although their
characteristics indicate that they were formed by water. Now,
according to the laws of the equilibrium of liquids and of gravity,
aqueous deposits cannot be formed except on horizontal planes,
and considering the fact that those that occur on inclined planes
are drawn downward by currents and their own weight, it is
obvious that such deposits must have been lifted up by some kind
of force after their solidification or transformation into rock.
       From these considerations one can conclude with certainty
that all the rocky layers resulting from aqueous deposits in a
perfectly horizontal position were formed over centuries by
still water, and that every time they are in an inclined position
it is because the ground was shaken and dislocated afterward by
generalized or partial upheavals of varying degrees.
       7. A characteristic fact of the highest importance because of
the irrefutable evidence it supplies consists in the fossil remains of
animals and plants that are found in huge quantities in the various
strata. And since these remains are found in even the hardest rock,
one must conclude that the existence of these beings was prior to

40
     A broad area of open land, often high but poorly drained, with patches of heath and peat
     bogs. (The American Heritage College Dictionary, 1979). – Tr.



                                             150

                                A Geological Sketch of the Earth


the formation of such rock. Now, if one considers the prodigious
number of centuries that were needed to harden them and bring
them to the state they have been in since time immemorial, one
must perforce conclude that the appearance of organic beings
upon the earth is lost in the night of time, and that, consequently,
it was well before the date implied in the book of Genesis.41
      8. Among these plant and animal remains there are those
that have been penetrated throughout, without altering their
form, by silicate or calcareous matter that transformed them into
stone, of which some are as hard as marble; these are petrifications
per se. Others were simply encased in this matter while in a state
of softness; these are found intact – sometimes entirely – in the
hardest stone. Others, finally, left only their impression, though
delicate and perfectly clear. Footprints have even been discovered
in some rock, and by the shape of the foot, toes and nails, one can
recognize the species of animal they came from.
       9. Understandably, animal fossils are comprised of only solid
and enduring parts, that is, bones, scales and horns. Sometimes
they are complete skeletons; however, most frequently they are
scattered parts, whose origin nevertheless is easy to recognize. By
examining a jawbone or tooth, one can thereby tell if it belonged
to an herbivore or a carnivore. Since all the parts of the animal have
a necessary correlation, the shape of the head, a shoulder-blade, a

41
     Fossil, from the Latin fossilia, fossilis, derived from fossa, fosse, and the verb fodere, to dig,
     to excavate the earth. In geology, this word refers to the bodies or remains of organic
     bodies coming from beings that lived before historical times. By extension, it also refers
     to the mineral substances with traces of the presence of organisms, such as those that are
     imprinted by plants or animals. The word petrification refers only to bodies that have been
     transformed into stone by the infiltration of silicate or calcareous matter into their organic
     tissues. All petrifications are necessarily fossils, but not all fossils are petrifications. Objects
     that are covered by a stony layer, once they are immersed in certain waters loaded with
     calcareous substances, such as those of the Saint-Allyre creek near Clermont in Auvergne,
     are not petrifications per se, but simply incrustations. Monuments, inscriptions and
     objects crafted by humans belong to the field of archeology. – Auth.

                                   Genesis - Chapter VII


leg bone or a foot bone are sufficient to determine its size, overall
shape and lifestyle.42 Land animals have an organization that does
not allow them to be confused with aquatic animals. Fossilized fish
and mollusk shells are extremely numerous; mollusk shells alone
sometimes form entire banks of great thickness. By their nature one
may easily determine if they were saltwater or freshwater animals.
      10. Rounded stones, which in some places become mighty
rocks, are an indisputable indication of their origin. They are
rounded like boulders along the seashore, a sure sign of the attrition
they endured by the effects of water. Areas where they are found to
be buried in considerable masses were obviously occupied by the
ocean or by either long-standing or violently agitated waters.
        11. The terrains of the diverse formations are furthermore
characterized by the very nature of the fossils they contain. The oldest
ones contain plant or animal species that have completely disappeared
from the surface of the globe. Some more recent species have also
disappeared, but similar ones remain that differ from their ancestors only
in size and a few nuances of shape. And finally, there are others, of which
we see the last representatives, which will obviously tend to disappear
in the not-too-distant future, such as the elephants, rhinoceroses and
hippopotami, etc. Hence, as the stratifications approach our era, the
animal and plant species also approach those that exist today.
        The upheavals and cataclysms that have occurred on the earth
since its origin have altered the conditions for its ability to sustain
life and have caused entire generations of living beings to disappear.
      12. By investigating the nature of the geological strata,
one can positively determine if at the time of their formation the
region that contains them was occupied by ocean or lakes, or by

42
     George Cuvier has taken paleontology to the point where only a single bone is often
     enough to determine the genus, species, shape and habits of an animal, and to reconstruct

forests or plains populated by land animals. Consequently, if in a
certain region one discovers a series of superposed strata containing
marine, freshwater and land fossils, alternately and repeatedly, it
is irrefutable proof that the region was often invaded by the sea,
covered with lakes and turned into dry land.
        And how many centuries upon centuries – thousands of
centuries, perhaps – must have been required for the completion of each
period! What a powerful force was needed to dislocate and then replace
the ocean, and to lift the mountains! How many physical revolutions
and violent upheavals the earth had to have to gone through before
becoming as we have seen it since historic times! And some would want
this to be the work of less time than it takes to make a plant grow!
      13. As stated earlier, the study of the geological strata attests
to successive formations that changed the appearance of the globe,
and it divides its history into several eras. These eras constitute
what are called geological periods, and knowledge of them is
essential for understanding Genesis. There are six main periods,
designated by the names primary, transition, secondary, tertiary,
diluvial, and post-diluvial or present period. The terrains formed
during the time of each period are also called primitive, transition,
secondary, etc. Thus it is said that this stratum or rock, or such
and such fossil are to be found in terrain of such and such period.
       14. It is essential to note that the number of these periods is
not absolute, but depends on the classification system. The six periods
designated above comprise only those that were marked by a notable
and widespread modification in the state of the globe. However,
observation has proven that much successive stratification occurred
during each period. That is why they have been divided into sub-periods
characterized by the nature of the terrains, and which raise to twenty-six
the number of well-characterized overall strata, not counting those that
resulted from modifications due to purely local causes.

                 The Primitive State of the Globe
        15. The flattening of the poles and other conclusive facts
are sure indications that at its origin the earth must have been in
a liquid or softened state. Such a state could have been caused by
matter liquefied by fire or soaked by water.
        It is proverbially stated: there is no smoke without a fire.
This proposition, strictly true, is an application of the principle:
there is no effect without a cause. For the same reason, it may be
said: there is no fire without a source. Now, by the facts before us,
it is not only smoke that is produced, but very real fire, which must
have a source. This fire coming from within the earth and not from
above it, the source must be within; the fire being permanent, the
source must also be.
        Heat, which increases as one goes deeper within the earth,
and which at a certain distance from the surface reaches an
extremely high temperature; the thermal sources that are hotter
the deeper they originate; the fires and masses of molten and
flaming matter that escape from volcanoes as if by huge blowers,
or through fissures produced by earthquakes, can leave no doubt
as to the existence of an inner fire.
      16. Experience shows that the temperature rises 1 degree
Celsius43 for each 30 meters44 of depth, from which it follows that
at a depth of 300 meters45, the increase is 10 degrees46; at 3,000
meters47, 100 degrees48 the temperature at which water boils; at

30,000 meters49 approximately 7 to 8 leagues50 1,000 degrees51.
At 25 leagues52 it is more than 3,300 degrees53, the temperature at
which no known matter can resist melting. From there down to the
center there is a distance of more than 1,400 leagues54 for a diameter
of 2,800 leagues55, which would be filled with molten matter.
       Although only conjecture – judging the cause by its effect –
this has all the characteristics of probability, and one may reach
the conclusion that the earth is still an incandescent mass covered
by a solid crust 25 leagues56 thick or more, which is only 120th of
its diameter. Proportionately, that would be much less than the
thickness of the thinnest orange peel.
       Moreover, the thickness of the earth’s crust is highly variable
because there are places – especially in volcanic areas – where the
heat and flexibility of the ground indicate that it is quite thin. The
high temperature of thermal waters is also an indication of the
proximity of the central fire.
       17. Such being the case, it becomes obvious that the primitive
state of fluidity or softness of the earth was caused by the action
of heat and not of water. Thus, at its beginning the earth was an
incandescent mass. As a result of the radiation of heat, it underwent
what happens to all molten matter: little by little, it cooled off, and
this cooling process naturally began at the surface, which hardened,
while the interior remained liquefied. Hence, one may compare the
earth to a lump of coal that comes out of the furnace all red, and

whose surface extinguishes and cools off upon contact with the air.
However, if it is broken, the inside will still be ablaze.
       18. At the time when the terrestrial globe was an incandescent
mass, it did not contain a single atom more or less than it does
today; under the influence of such a high temperature, the majority
of the substances that compose it, and which we see in the form
of liquids or solids, soils, rocks, metals and crystals, were in a
much different state. They merely went through a transformation.
As a result of cooling off and mixing, the elements formed new
combinations. The air, considerably expanded, extended a huge
distance; all the water, forcefully reduced to steam, was mixed in
with the air. All the matter susceptible to volatilization, such as
metals, sulfur and carbon, were in a gaseous state. The state of the
atmosphere had no comparison with what it is today. The density
of all these vapors gave it an opaqueness that not one ray of the
sun could pass through. If any living being could have existed on
the globe’s surface at that time, it would have been illuminated
only by the sinister glow of the furnace beneath its feet and the
atmosphere ablaze, and it would have never even suspected the
existence of the sun.

                   The Primary Period
       19. The first effect of the cooling process was the
solidification of the outer surface of the molten mass, which
formed a solid crust that was thin at first but little by little became
thicker. This crust was composed of extremely hard rock called
granite, thus labeled because of its granulated appearance. One
may distinguish three main substances in it: feldspar, quartz or
rock crystal, and mica; this last has a metallic luster although it is
not, in fact, a metal.


                                 156

                     A Geological Sketch of the Earth


        The granite layer was thus the first to form on the globe,
which it encases completely and constitutes a sort of bony
framework; it is the direct product of consolidated molten matter.
It is upon this layer, and in the cavities that appeared on its tortured
surface, where the successively deposited strata of other terrains
formed afterward. What distinguishes the granite layer from the
latter is the absence of any stratification; that is, it forms a compact
and uniform mass throughout its thickness and it is not stratified.
The effervescence of the incandescent matter must have produced
numerous, deep fissures, through which this matter poured out.
        20. The second effect of the cooling process was to liquefy
some of the matter contained in the air in the state of vapor, and
which then precipitated onto the surface of the soil. Consequently,
there were showers and lakes of sulfur and bitumen, veritable
streams of iron, copper, lead and other molten metals. This matter
infiltrated into the fissures to create veins and lodes of metals.
        Under the influence of these various agents, the granite
surface underwent alternating decompositions; mixtures were
produced that formed the primitive ground per se, distinct from
rock of granite, but in indistinct masses, and without regular
stratification.
        Next came the waters, which, falling upon the fiery ground,
re-vaporized and re-fell in torrential rains, again and again, until
the temperature finally allowed it to remain on the ground in a
liquid state.
        It was with the formation of the granite layer that the series
of geological periods began, to which it would be proper to add
that of the primitive, incandescent state of the globe.
      21. Such was the aspect of that primary period, a veritable
chaos of all elements mixed together and seeking their place, a
period in which no living being could have possibly existed. Thus,


                                   157

                            Genesis - Chapter VII


one of its distinctive characteristics in geology is the absence of any
trace of plant or animal life whatsoever.
       It is impossible to assign a definite timeframe to that first
period as well as the following ones. However, according to the
time needed for a cannonball of a given size, heated to white-hot,
and then cooled off to the point that a drop of water can remain on
it in a liquid state, it has been calculated that if such a cannonball
were the size of the earth, it would take more than a million years.

                   The Transition Period
        22. At the beginning of the transition period, the solid
granite crust was still very thin and offered only very weak
resistance to the effervescence of the fiery matter that it covered
and compressed. Thus, dilations were produced, numerous fissures
through which the interior lava escaped. The ground displayed
only slight irregularities.
        Shallow waters covered nearly the entire surface of the
globe, with the exception of elevated parts that formed frequently
submersed lowlands.
        The air was little by little purged of the heaviest matter
that had been gasified temporarily, and which, upon condensing
through the effect of the cooling process, precipitated onto the
surface of the ground to be carried away and dissolved by the
waters afterward.
        When we speak of the cooling process at that time, one must
understand the term in a relative sense, that is, in relation to the primitive
state, because the temperature must still have been boiling hot.
        The dense aqueous vapors that rose from this entire immense
liquid surface fell back again in torrential, hot rain that obscured
the air. Nevertheless, the rays of the sun began to appear through
the misty atmosphere.


                                     158

                           A Geological Sketch of the Earth


      One of the last substances of which the air must have been
purged – because it is naturally in the gaseous state – was carbonic
acid, which at the time formed one of its constituent parts.
      23. At this time the layers of sediment started to form upon
the ground, deposited by waters loaded with silt and other diverse
matter suitable for organic life.
      Then, the first living beings of the plant and animal
kingdoms appeared; small in number at first, one finds more and
more vestiges of them as one ascends the layers of this formation. It
is worth noting that life manifests everywhere as soon as conditions
are favorable, and that each species is born once the conditions
proper for its existence are produced.
        24. The first organic beings that appeared on the earth were
plants of the least complex organization, designated in botany by
the names cryptogams, dicotyledons and monocotyledons, that
is, lichens, mushrooms, mosses, ferns and herbaceous plants. One
does not yet see any trees with woody trunks except palm types,
whose spongy stem is analogous to that of herbs57.
        The animals of this period, which came after the first plants,
were exclusively marine types. At first, there were the polyparia, radiata
and zoophytes: animals whose simple and, shall I say, rudimentary
organization closely approximated that of plants. Later came the
crustaceans and fish whose species no longer exist nowadays.
       25. Under the influence of heat and humidity, and as a
consequence of the excessive carbonic acid – a gas unsuitable for
terrestrial animals to breathe but necessary for plants – disseminated
in the air, the exposed grounds quickly became covered with lush
vegetation, while at the same time aquatic plants multiplied in
the swamps. Plants of this kind, which today are simple herbs of a
57
     Herb: a flowering plant whose stem above ground does not become woody and persistent
     (Webster’s, 1991, op. cit.) – Tr.



                                           159

few centimeters, reached prodigious heights and diameters. Thus,
there were forests of tree-like ferns 8 to 10 meters58 high and of
proportional diameter; lycopods (club moss) of the same size;
horsetail 4 to 5 meters59 tall, but which today are only 1 meter60; and
an infinite number of species that no longer exist. Toward the end
of the period, a few coniferous or pine-type trees began to appear.
       26. As a result of the displacement of the waters, the grounds
that produced such masses of vegetation were submerged over and
over, and were covered again and again with sediments, while those
that dried out were in turn decorated with similar vegetation.
Hence, many generations of plants were alternately destroyed and
renewed. The same did not occur with the animals, which, since
they were all aquatic, could not undergo such alternations.
       The plant remains accumulated over a long series of
centuries to form extremely thick layers. Under the action of
heat, humidity and the pressure exerted by later soil deposits,
and undoubtedly due to various chemical agents, gases, acids and
salts produced by a combination of primitive elements, this plant
matter underwent a fermentation that converted it into coal. Coal
mines are therefore the direct product of the decomposition of
heaps of plants accumulated during the transition period, which is
why coal may be found on nearly every continent.61
      27. The fossil remains of the lush vegetation of that era, found
today under the ice of the polar lands as well as in the tropics, lead
to the necessary conclusion that since the vegetation was uniform,
the temperature also must have been. The poles, therefore, were not

     Peat was formed in the same way by the decomposition of plant accumulations in

     different conditions, it did not have time to carbonize – Auth.

                              A Geological Sketch of the Earth


covered with ice as they are now. Back then, the earth drew its heat
from itself, from the central fire that warmed equally the entire solid,
quite thin layer. This heat was much greater than what the solar rays
were able to furnish, weak as they still were due to the density of
the atmosphere. Only later, when the central heat could exert only
a weak or no action at all upon the outer surface of the globe, did
the heat from the sun become preponderant, and the polar regions,
which received only oblique rays providing very little heat, became
covered with ice. We know that, at the time of which we speak – and
even for a long time thereafter – ice was unknown on the earth.
       That period must have been very long, judging by the
number and thickness of the coal layers.62

                           The Secondary Period
      28. With the end of the transition period, the colossal
vegetation and the animals that characterized that era disappeared,
either because the atmospheric conditions were no longer the
same or because a series of cataclysms wiped out everything that
lived on the earth. It is probable that both causes contributed to
this change, because, on one hand, a study of the terrains that
signaled the end of that period attest to great convulsions caused
by upthrusts and eruptions that spread huge quantities of lava
over the ground, and because, on the other hand, notable changes
occurred in the three kingdoms of nature.
      29. From the mineral aspect, the secondary period is
characterized by numerous and solid strata that attest to a slow

62
     Under the Bay of Fundy (Nova Scotia), Mr. Lyell found, under a coal layer 400 meters [1,200
     feet] thick, 68 different levels, displaying evident traces of many soils from forests, wherein
     the tree trunks still had their roots. (L. Figuier) Supposing that it took 1,000 years to form
     each of these levels, it would have taken 68,000 years for this single coal layer to have
     formed – Auth.

formation in the midst of the waters and signal different well-
characterized eras.
       The vegetation spreads less quickly and is less colossal than
in the preceding period, undoubtedly as a result of the decrease in
heat and humidity, along with the supervening modifications in the
elements comprising the atmosphere. The herbaceous and bulbous
plants are joined by those with woody trunks and the first trees per se.
       30. The animals are still aquatic, or are amphibious at best;
animal life on dry land makes little progress. A prodigious quantity
of shell animals develops in the seas as a result of the formation of
calcareous matter; new fish species of a more perfected organization
than in the prior period appear. The first cetaceans arrive. The
animals most characteristic of this period are the gigantic reptiles,
among which may be noted:
       Ichthyosaurus – a species of fish-lizard that reached a length
of nearly 10 meters, and whose prodigiously elongated jaws were
armed with 180 teeth. Its overall shape looked a little like that of
a crocodile, but without the scaly skin; its eyes were the size of a
human head; it had fins like a whale, and like a whale, it expelled
air through a blow-hole.
       Plesiosaurus – another marine reptile as large as the
ichthyosaurus. Its extremely long neck was bent like that of a swan
and gave it the appearance of a huge snake fixed to the body of a
turtle. It had the head of a lizard and the teeth of a crocodile. Its
skin must have been smooth like the ichthyosaurus’, because no
sign of scales or a carapace has yet been discovered.63
       Teleosaurus – this one looked more like today’s crocodiles,
which seem to be miniatures of it. Like crocodiles, it had a scaly
hide and lived both in water and on land. It was around 10 meters64
63
     The first fossil of this animal was discovered in 1823 in England. Fossils were also later
     found in France and Germany. – Auth.

long, of which 3 or 465composed the head. Its enormous mouth
could open up to 2 meters66.
        Megalosaurus – a large lizard, a species of crocodile 14 to 15
meters67 in length, essentially carnivorous, that fed on reptiles, small
crocodiles and turtles. Its formidable jaws were armed with teeth
in the shape of a double-edged billhook blade curved backward in
such a way that once they sunk into prey, it was impossible for it
to get loose.
        Iguanodon – The largest lizard that has ever appeared on the
earth. It measured 20 to 25 meters68 from its head to the tip of its
tail. Its snout was topped by a bony horn similar to that of today’s
iguana, which the animal seemed no different from except in size
(the modern-day iguana is only about 1 meter69 in length). The
shape of its teeth shows that it was herbivorous and that of its feet
that it was a land animal.
        Pterodactyl – a bizarre animal the size of a swan possessing a
reptile-like body, a bird-like head and bat-like fleshy membranes that
connected its toes. These membranes were quite long and acted like a
parachute when it jumped on its prey from the top of a tree or from a
rock. It did not have a horny beak like birds, but its jawbones, as long as
half its body, were adorned with teeth and ended in a point-like beak.
       31. During this period, which must have been very long –
as attested to by the number and strength of the geological strata –
animal life developed abundantly in the waters, as had occurred
with vegetation in the previous period. The air, purer and more
suitable for breathing, began to allow a few animals to live on
land. The oceans were displaced several times, but without violent

upheavals. With this period, those species of gigantic aquatic
animals disappeared in their turn to be replaced later by analogous
ones of less disproportionate shapes and smaller sizes.
       32. Pride has caused humans to say that all the animals were
created for their purposes and needs. However, what is the number
of those that serve them directly, those they can subjugate, compared
to the incalculable number of those with which they have never
had and never will have any relationship? How can such a theory
be sustained in the presence of such innumerable species which
populated the earth by themselves for thousands and thousands of
centuries, and which finally disappeared before humankind even
arrived? Could one say that they were created for humankind’s
benefit? Nevertheless, those species had their reason for being, their
usefulness. God could not have created them on a whim only to
take pleasure in wiping them out later, for all of them had life,
instincts, and feelings of pain and well-being. For what purpose did
God create them? That purpose must have been supremely wise,
even though we do not yet comprehend it. Maybe one day it will be
given to humans to understand it in order to confound their pride.
Meanwhile, waiting, how much their ideas have broadened in light
of the new horizons into which they are now permitted to plunge
their sight, in the presence of the imposing spectacle of creation, so
majestic in its slowness, so admirable in its foresight, so punctual,
so precise and so invariable in its results!

                     The Tertiary Period
       33. With the tertiary period, a new order of things begins for the
earth. The state of its surface changes completely in appearance. The
conditions for supporting life are modified profoundly and are close to
the state they are in today. The first stages of this period are highlighted


                                    164

                     A Geological Sketch of the Earth


by a halt in plant and animal production; everything reveals the traces
of an almost general destruction of living beings, and then subsequent
new species appear whose more perfect organization is adapted to the
nature of the environment in which they have been called to live.
        34. During the preceding periods, due to its thinness the
globe’s solid crust displayed, as stated above, very weak resistance to
the action of the interior fire. This envelope tore easily to allow molten
matter to spread freely across the surface of the ground. This was no
longer the case when it acquired a certain thickness. The fiery matter,
compressed in every part like boiling water in a sealed container, ended
up producing a sort of explosion. The granite mass split violently at
a multitude of points and was crisscrossed with fissures like a cracked
vase. Along the course of these crevasses the rising-then-sinking solid
crust formed peaks, mountain chains and their offshoots. Some of
the untorn parts of the envelope were merely raised, whereas at other
points, depressions and excavations were produced.
        The surface of the ground thus became very uneven; the
waters, which until then had almost uniformly covered a great part
of its area, were driven to the lowest places, leaving in the dry parts
vast continents or isolated mountain peaks that formed islands.
        Such was the great phenomenon that was completed in the
tertiary period, and which transformed the appearance of the globe.
It was produced neither instantaneously nor simultaneously at all
points, but successively and at various times remote from one another.
       35. One of the first consequences of this upheaval, as stated
earlier, was the inclination of the primitive, horizontal sediment
layers, which remained in this last position wherever the ground
was not altered. Thus, it is on the sides and in the vicinity of
mountains that these inclinations are most pronounced.
      36. In order to reach the first formation in the regions where
the sedimentary layers retained their horizontalness, it is necessary


                                   165

                                   Genesis - Chapter VII


to traverse all the others, frequently to a considerable depth, at the
end of which one eventually finds the granite rock. However, when
these layers were raised into mountains, they were raised higher
than their normal level – and sometimes to great heights – in such
a way that if one were to make a vertical cut in the mountainside,
they would be exposed to view in all their thickness and would be
superposed like the layers of the foundation of a building.
       This is why at great heights one can find huge mollusk shell
beds that had originally formed in the depths of the seas. It is perfectly
known nowadays that there was no era during which the level of the
sea could have reached such a height, because all the waters that existed
on the earth would not have been sufficient, even if they had been a
hundred times more voluminous. Hence, one would have to assume
that the amount of water decreased, but then one would have to ask
what happened to the portion that disappeared. The upthrusts, which
are today an incontestable fact, explain both logically and unbendingly
the marine deposits that may be found on certain mountains.70
       37. In the places where the upthrust of the primitive rock
caused a complete break in the ground, whether by its speed or
by the shape, size, height and volume of the upraised mass, the
granite was exposed bare like a tooth that has broken through the
gums. Uplifted, broken and set back in order, the layers that had
covered it were uncovered. That is why lands belonging to the oldest
formations, and which may be found in their original position to a
great depth, comprise the ground of certain regions today.
       38. The granite mass, dislocated by the effect of the
upthrusts, left fissures in some places through which the interior
fire escaped, and through which molten matter flowed out: these
are volcanoes. Volcanoes are like chimneys of this huge furnace, or

70

better still, safety valves, which, providing an exit for excess igneous
matter, preserve the globe from otherwise terrible disturbances.
Consequently, it may be stated that the number of active volcanoes
is a cause of security for the whole of the ground’s surface.
       One can get an idea of the intensity of such fire by thinking
about how many volcanoes have opened up in the middle of the
ocean, and about the fact that the mass of water that covers and
enters them is not enough to extinguish them.
       39. The upthrusts operating on the solid mass necessarily
displaced the waters, which retreated to the hollow areas and became
deeper due to the rising of emerging terrains and the sinking of
others. However, these same low places, thrust up in their turn here
and there, fended off the waters, which then flowed elsewhere, and
so on and so forth until they could settle in a more stable position.
       The successive dislocations of this liquid mass inevitably
carved and altered the surface of the ground. As the waters flowed
off, they drew with them part of the land of the earlier formations
uncovered by the upthrusts, denuded some of the mountains that
had been covered by them and exposed their granite or calcareous
base. Deep valleys were hollowed out, while others were filled up.
       Hence, there are mountains formed directly by the action
of the central fire: these are principally the mountains of granite.
Others are the result of the action of the waters, which, carrying
along moveable earth and soluble matter, carved valleys around a
resistant base, calcareous or otherwise.
       The matter carried by the water currents formed the layers
of the tertiary period, which are easily distinguished from those of
the preceding periods, not so much by their composition, which is
much the same, but by their placement.
       The strata of the primary, transition, and secondary periods
formed upon a surface that was disturbed very little, and are
therefore almost uniform throughout the earth. Those of the

                                   167

                         Genesis - Chapter VII


tertiary period, on the other hand, formed over a highly uneven
base, and due to the carrying action of the waters, have a more
local character. Everywhere, however, by excavating to a certain
depth one can find all the previous layers in the order of their
formation, while one cannot find everywhere the terrain of the
tertiary period, nor all of its layers.
      40. During the ground upheavals taking place at the
beginning of this period, one perceives that organic life must have
experienced a standstill, recognizable by examining the terrains
lacking fossils. However, once a calmer state ensued, plants and
animals reappeared. With the conditions for life changing and the
atmosphere becoming more purified, one sees new species being
formed bearing a more perfect organization. Regarding their
structure, plants differ little from those of our day.
       41. During the two preceding periods, the grounds not
covered with water were not very extensive and were still marshy
and frequently flooded; that is why there were only aquatic animals
or amphibians. The tertiary period, which saw the formation of
vast continents, is characterized by the appearance of land animals.
       Just as the transition period saw the appearance of colossal
vegetation and the secondary period gigantic reptiles, the tertiary
period saw the appearance of giant mammals such as the elephant,
rhinoceros, hippopotamus, paleotherium, megatherium, dinotherium,
mastodon, mammoth, etc. These last two varieties of elephant were 5
to 6 meters71 in height and their tusks reached up to 4 meters72 in
length. This period also saw the arrival of birds as well as a majority
of the animal species in existence today. Some species of this era
survived the subsequent cataclysms; others, generically classified as
antediluvial animals, disappeared completely, or were replaced by

similar species that were less heavy and massive, and whose first
types were like prototypes. Such were the felis spelaea, a carnivore the
size of a bull, with the anatomical characteristics of a tiger and lion,
and the cervus megaceros, a variety of elk, whose antlers, 3 meters73 in
length, were spaced 3 to 4 meters74 from tip to tip.

                            The Diluvial Period
        42. This period is marked by one of the greatest cataclysms
that have ever shaken the globe, changing once more the aspect of its
appearance and destroying forever a huge number of living species, of
which only remains have been found. Everywhere, it left traces that
attest to how widespread it was. The waters were violently torn from
their resting places to invade the continents, taking earth and rock with
them, denuding mountains and uprooting centuries-old forests. The
new deposits they formed are designated in geology as diluvial terrains.
       43. One of the most significant signs of this great disaster
are rocks called erratic blocks: the name given to granite boulders
that are found isolated on the plains, resting on top of tertiary
terrains and in the middle of diluvial terrains, sometimes several
hundred leagues from the mountains from which they were torn.
It is obvious that they could not have been carried such great
distances except by violent currents.75
        44. Another no less characteristic fact, and whose cause has
not yet been explained, is that it is in the diluvial terrains that the first
aerolites are found; since it is only in this epoch that they began to
fall, the cause that produced them must not have existed previously.

       45. It is also around this period that the poles began to be
covered with ice and that the glaciers in the mountains were formed,
which points to a noticeable change in the earth’s temperature. This
change must have been sudden, because if it had been gradual,
animals such as elephants, which today live only in hot climates,
but which are found in such great numbers in the fossilized state
in the polar lands, would have had time to gradually move to more
temperate regions. On the contrary, everything proves that they
must have been caught suddenly by a great cold spell and encased
in the glaciers.76
       46. This was, then, a veritable universal deluge. Opinions
are divided as to the causes that might have produced it, but
whatever they may have been, the fact remains no less real.
       It is generally thought that an abrupt change occurred in
the position of the earth’s axis and poles resulting in a surge of the
waters over the globe’s surface. If the change had occurred slowly,
the waters would have been displaced gradually without shock,
whereas everything points to a violent and sudden upheaval.
Ignorant as we are of the true cause, one can state only hypotheses.
       The sudden displacement of the waters could also have
been caused by the upthrust of certain parts of the solid crust and
the formation of new mountains in the bosom of the oceans, as
happened at the beginning of the tertiary period; however, besides
the fact that the cataclysm would not have been universal, this would
not explain the sudden change in the temperature at the poles.

     In 1771 the Russian naturalist Pallas discovered the entire body of a mammoth covered
     with its hide and part of its flesh in the middle of the ice of the North. In 1799 another one,
     described by the naturalist Adams, was discovered also encased in a huge block of ice at the
     mouth of the Lena River in Siberia. The Jakoutes of the area cut its flesh into pieces to feed
     their dogs. The hide was covered with black hair and the neck was laurelled with a thick
     mane. Without the tusks, which measured more than 3 meters [9 feet], the head weighed
     more than 400 pounds. Its skeleton is in the St. Petersburg museum. On the islands and
     beaches of the glacial sea, there is such a large quantity of tusks that they have become the
     object of a considerable trade, under the name of fossilized or Siberian ivory. – Auth.

       47. In the chaos caused by the upheaval of the waters,
many animals perished. Others, in order to escape the inundation,
retreated to high ground, caves and crevasses where they perished
en masse either from hunger, from devouring one another,
or perhaps from the eruption of the waters in the places where
they had sought refuge, and from which they could not escape.
This would explain the large quantity of diverse animal bones –
carnivores and others – that are found mixed together in certain
caves, named for this reason breccia or bone caves. They are most
often found under stalagmites. In some, the bones seem to have
been carried there by water currents.77

          The Post-Diluvial or Present Period –
               The Birth of Humankind
       48. Once equilibrium was reestablished on the surface of the
globe, plant and animal life quickly resumed its course. The ground
had hardened to assume a more stable position; the air had become
more purified and was more suitable for more delicate organs. The
sun, which shined with all its light through a clean atmosphere,
spread a less suffocating and more vivifying heat than that of the
internal furnace. The earth became populated with less-ferocious and
more-social animals. The more-succulent plants offered less coarse
nourishment. In other words, everything was prepared on the earth
for the new guest that would inhabit it. And it was then that human
beings appeared, the last beings of creation, whose intelligence should
from then on contribute to the overall progress as well as to their own.

     A large number of such caverns are known, of which some extend for a considerable
     distance. In Mexico there is one that extends for many leagues. The one at Adelsberg
     in Carniola (Austria) is no less than 3 leagues [9 miles]. One of the most famous is at
     Gailenreuth in Wurttemberg. There are also many in France, England, Germany, Sicily, and
     other European countries. – Auth.

       49. Have human beings really existed on the earth only
since the diluvial period, or had they appeared before? This is a
very controversial question nowadays, but its solution – whatever
it may be – would not change anything about the set of established
facts, and the appearance of human beings would be no less than
thousands of years prior to the date assigned by the biblical Genesis.
       What led to the thinking that the appearance of humans
occurred only after the deluge is that no authentic vestige of their
existence in the prior period has ever been found. The bones that
were discovered in various places, and which led to the belief in
the existence of a supposed race of gigantic antediluvians, were
recognized as being elephant bones.
       What cannot be doubted is that humans did not exist in
the primary, transition, or secondary periods, not only because no
trace of them has ever been discovered, but because life-supporting
conditions did not yet exist for them. If they appeared during the
tertiary period, it could have been only toward the end and they
would not have yet multiplied very much.
       Furthermore, the diluvial period was short; consequently, it
did not bring notable changes in atmospheric conditions. Plants
and animals were nearly the same before and afterward; it is
therefore not impossible that the appearance of humans preceded
the great cataclysm. The presence of monkeys at that time is an
established fact today and recent discoveries seem to confirm that
of humans as well.78
       Whatever the case may be as to whether or not human
beings appeared before the great universal flood, it is certain that
their humanitarian role actually did not really begin to take shape
except in the post-diluvial period; one might therefore consider
this period as characterized by their presence.

       Theories about the Earth
           The Projection Theory • The Condensation Theory •
            The Incrustation Theory • The Soul of the Earth



                           The Projection Theory
       1. Of all the theories referring to the earth’s origin, the one
that has received the most credit of late is that of Buffon79 either
because of this author’s position in the academic world or because
not much more was known at the time in which he lived.
       Observing that all the planets were moving in the same
direction – west to east – and on the same plane, traveling orbits
whose inclination did not exceed seven and a half degrees, Buffon
concluded from this uniformity that they must have been set in
motion by the same cause.
       Since the sun is a molten incandescent mass, Buffon believed
that a comet had struck it obliquely, scraping its surface and tearing
away a portion, which, projected into space by the violence of the
collision, spit into many fragments. These fragments formed the
planets, which continued to move in a circle due to a combination
of centripetal and centrifugal forces and in the direction given to
them by the initial collision, i.e., on an ecliptic plane.

                                                    173

                        Genesis - Chapter VIII


       The planets would thus be parts of the incandescent substance
of the sun and would therefore also have been incandescent at
their origin. They began to cool off and consolidate in an amount
of time proportional to their volume, and when the temperature
permitted, life appeared on the surface.
       As a result of the gradual lessening of the central heat, the
earth at a given time would reach a state of complete cooling; the
liquid mass would solidify entirely, and the air, condensing more
and more, would finally disappear. The decreasing temperature
would render life impossible and would bring about the decrease
and subsequent disappearance of all organic beings. The cooling,
which began at the poles, would reach all the continents all the
way to the equator.
       Such is, according to Buffon, the current state of the moon,
which, being smaller than the earth, would now be an extinct
world where life henceforth is excluded. The sun itself would
one day suffer the same fate. According to his calculations, the
earth would have taken approximately 74,000 years to reach its
current temperature, and in 93,000 years it would see the end of
organized nature.
      2. Buffon’s theory was disproved by new scientific
discoveries, and has now been almost completely abandoned for
the following reasons:
      1) For a long time, it was believed that comets were solid
objects, whose encounter with a planet could lead to the latter’s
destruction. According to this hypothesis, Buffon’s supposition
would not be improbable. But today we know that comets are
composed of a condensed gaseous matter, rarified enough,
however, that it is possible to see medium-sized stars through
their cores. In this state, offering less resistance than the sun, a
violent collision capable of projecting a portion of its mass to
such distances would be impossible.

                                Theories about the Earth


       2) The sun’s incandescent nature is also a hypothesis that
nothing till now has confirmed, but which, to the contrary,
observations seem to refute. Although there is no certainty yet as
to its nature, powerful means of observation currently available
have enabled us to study it more thoroughly. It is now generally
believed by science that the sun is a globe composed of solid matter
surrounded by a luminous or photospheric atmosphere that is not
in contact with its surface.80
       3) In Buffon’s time, only the six planets acknowledged by
the ancients were known: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn. Afterward, many more were discovered, of which
three – Juno, Ceres and Pallas – have inclined orbits of 13, 10 and
34 degrees, respectively, which does not agree with the hypothesis
of a unique projection movement.
       4) Buffon’s calculations regarding the cooling have
been recognized as being completely inaccurate ever since the
discovery of the law of decreasing heat by Fourier. The earth did
not require 74,000 years to reach its current temperature, but
millions of years.
       5) Buffon considered only the globe’s central heat, without
taking the sun’s rays into account. Today, highly precise scientific
data based on experimentation has shown that, due to the thickness
of the earth’s crust, the internal heat of the globe has for a long
time played only an insignificant part in the exterior surface’s
temperature. The variations that this atmosphere undergoes are
periodic and are due to the preponderant action of the solar heat
(see chap. VII, no. 25). The effect of this cause being permanent,
while that of the central heat is nil or almost nil, the diminution
of the latter cannot bring about noticeable modifications on the

earth’s surface. In order for the earth to become uninhabitable due
to overall cooling, the sun would have to be extinguished.81

                     The Condensation Theory
        3. The theory of the formation of the earth due to the
condensation of cosmic matter is the prevailing one in science
nowadays because it is the one that is best supported by observation,
that best resolves the greatest number of problems, and which is
based, more than all the others, on the great principle of universal
unity. It was described previously in chapter VI under the heading
General Uranography.
        As we can see, these first two theories arrive at the same result:
the primitive, incandescent state of the globe, the formation of a solid
crust through cooling, the existence of a central fire and the appearance
of organic life as soon as the temperature renders it possible. They
differ, however, at essential points and it is quite possible that if Buffon
were alive today, he would have formed other ideas.
        Geology takes the earth at the point where direct observation is
possible. Its state prior to that is outside the realm of experimentation
and can be nothing but conjectural; thus, between two hypotheses,
common sense says that one must choose the one which is sanctioned
by logic and which better agrees with observed facts.

                       The Incrustation Theory
     4. We will mention this theory only to make note of it
because there is nothing scientific about it; nonetheless, it has

                                   Theories about the Earth


caused certain repercussions lately and has seduced a few people.
It is summarized in the following letter:
        “According to the Bible, God created the world in six days,
four thousand years before the Christian era. This is contested
by geologists through their study of fossils and the thousands of
incontestable characteristics of ancientness that date the origin
of the earth back to millions of years. However, the Scriptures
speak the truth and geologists do too, and it was a simple peasant82
who brought them into agreement by teaching us that our earth
is an extremely modern encrusted planet composed of extremely
ancient matter.
        “Either after the destruction of an unknown planet that had
reached maturity, or in harmony with one that used to exist in
the place we occupy today, the soul of the earth received orders
to bring its satellites together in order to form our current globe
according to the rules of progress in everything and for everything.
Only four of these heavenly bodies consented to the association
proposed to them. Only the moon persisted in its autonomy, for
globes also possess free will. To proceed with this melding, the earth’s
soul directed an attracting, magnetic ray toward the satellites,
which put into a cataleptic state all their plant, animal and human
life appurtenances that would be brought into the community.
This operation had as its witnesses only the earth’s soul and the
great celestial messengers that aided it in the great task of opening
up the globes to share their innards in common. Once the
melding was done, the waters flowed into the empty places left
by the moon’s absence. The atmospheres mixed together and the
awakening – or resurrection – of the prototypes that had been in
the cataleptic state began. Human beings were the last to be drawn
out of their hypnotic state and they found themselves surrounded
by luxurious vegetation and the animals that dwelt in peace about

them in the terrestrial paradise. All this was accomplished in six
days by the very powerful workers that God had put in charge of
the deed. The planet Asia brought us the yellow race – the planet
that had been civilized the longest; Africa, the black race; Europe,
the white race; and America, the red race. The moon would have
perhaps brought us the green or the blue race.
      “Thus, certain animals, whose remains are all that are left
of them, never lived on our current earth, but would have been
brought from other worlds scattered by old age. The fossils that are
found in climates where such life could not have lived down here
undoubtedly lived in much different zones on the globes where
they originated. Such remains are found at our poles, whereas the
animals used to live on the equator of their former worlds.”
       5. This theory has the most positive data of experimental
science against it; moreover, it ignores the whole issue of the origin
it claims to resolve. It states how the earth might have been formed,
but it does not state how the four worlds that came together to
structure it were formed.
       If things had happened this way, why is it that nowhere can
traces be found of the enormous melding that must have extended
to the entrails of the globe? Each one of those worlds – Asia,
Africa, Europe and America – upon bringing their own matter
would have had a particularly different geology, which is not the
case. On the contrary, we see first of all that the granite nucleus is
uniform, of a homogenous composition in all parts of the globe
and without break in continuity. Second, the geological strata of
the same formation, identical in composition and superposed
everywhere in the same order, continue without interruption
from one side of the oceans to the other, from Europe to Asia,
from Africa to the Americas, reciprocally. These layers, which
testify to the transformations of the globe, verify that such
transformations occurred all over the surface and not only on

                                 178

                                   Theories about the Earth


one part. They display the periods of the appearance, existence
and disappearance of the same plant and animal species equally
in different parts of the world. They show the flora and fauna
of those remote periods progressing simultaneously everywhere
under the influence of a uniform temperature, changing their
characteristics everywhere as the temperature changed. Such a
state of things is irreconcilable with the formation of the earth by
the joining of several different worlds.
       Furthermore, we must ask what would have become of
the ocean that occupied the space left by the moon, since it was
unwilling to join with its sisters. What would happen to the
present earth if someday the moon got the idea to reclaim its place
and thus expel the ocean?
       6. This theory has seduced a few people because it seems
to explain the presence on the earth of the different human races83
and their localization. However, since these races could originate
on those separate worlds, why could they not have done so at
several points of the same globe? It wants to resolve one problem
with an even bigger one. Actually, whatever had been the speed
and artfulness of the process, such a joining together would not
have been possible without violent upheavals. The faster it was the
more disastrous the cataclysms would have been. Hence, it seems
impossible that beings that were simply put to sleep through a magnetic
process could have withstood them to awaken peacefully afterward.
If they were mere prototypes, what were they composed of? How
could beings that were completely formed have been reduced to
the state of prototypes? Moreover, the question remains as to how
these prototypes developed all over again. This would again be the
earth forming in a miraculous way, but by a process less poetic and
less grandiose than the one in the biblical Genesis, whereas natural

laws, deduced from observation, give a much more complete and
rational explanation for its formation.84

                           The Soul of the Earth
       7. The soul of the earth plays a principal role in the
incrustation theory. Let us see if this idea has a better foundation.
       Organic development is always related to the development
of the intellectual principle. The organism completes itself to the
degree that its soul’s faculties multiply. In all beings, the organic
scale always follows the progression of the intelligence, from the
polyp to the human being. It could be no other way, since the soul
requires an instrument that is appropriate for the importance of
the functions it must perform. What good would it do the oyster
to have the intelligence of an ape without the organs needed for
manifesting it? Thus, if the earth were an animate being serving
as the body of a special soul, by reason of its constitution this soul
should be even more rudimentary than that of the polyp, since the
earth does not even have the vitality of a plant. However, by the
role attributed to this soul, one would make it a being gifted with
reason and with the most complete free will, in short, a high order
spirit, which is not rational, since never would a spirit have been
so badly divided up and more imprisoned. Understood in such a
sense, the idea of an earth soul must therefore be ranked among
theoretical and chimerical concepts.
       By soul of the earth, one might more rationally understand the
idea of a collectivity of spirits in charge of developing and guiding

84
     When such a theory is connected to an entire cosmogony, one would have to ask upon
     what rational base the rest could lie. The notion that by means of this theory we can
     establish agreement between the biblical Genesis and science is entirely illusory, since
     science itself contradicts it. The author of the above letter – a learned man - while seduced
     for a moment by this theory, soon saw its vulnerable sides and did not delay in combating
     it with the support of science. – Auth.

its constitutive elements, which already supposes a certain degree
of intellectual development; or better yet, the spirit to whom the
lofty guidance of the moral destinies and progress of its inhabitants
has been entrusted, a mission that could only be attributed to a
being eminently superior in wisdom and knowledge. In this case,
this spirit is not, properly speaking, the soul of the earth, since it is
neither incarnated within it nor subordinated to its material state.
It is a leader in charge of its direction, like a general is in charge of
conducting an army.
        A spirit charged with a mission as important as governing
a world could not be capricious; otherwise, God would be very
improvident to entrust the execution of God’s laws to beings
capable of transgressing them through their ill will. Now then,
according to the incrustation doctrine, it would have been the ill
will of the soul of the moon that would have caused the earth to
remain incomplete. There are ideas that are self-refuting (see Revue
Spirite, Sept. 1868, p. 261).

        General or Partial Transformations
       1. The geological periods point out the phases of the
general appearance of the globe resulting from its transformations.
However, except for the diluvial period, which was characterized
by a sudden upheaval, all the others occurred slowly and without
a brusque transition. Throughout the time the globe’s constituent
elements took to settle into their final positions, changes must
have been of a general order. Once the base consolidated, only
partial modifications occurred on the surface.
       2. Besides the general upheaval, the earth experienced a
large number of local disturbances that changed the appearance
of certain regions. As with all the other disturbances, two causes
contributed to them: fire and water.
       Fire: whether by the volcanic eruptions that buried surrounding
terrains under thick layers of ash and lava, engulfing villages and their


                                  183

                           Genesis - Chapter IX


inhabitants; whether by earthquakes or by upthrusts of the solid
crust, driving the waters back to the lowest areas; or whether by the
sinking of the crust in certain places to a greater or lesser extent, into
which the waters flowed leaving other lands uncovered. This is what
caused islands to emerge in the middle of the ocean, while others
disappeared, how portions of continents separated to form islands,
and how dried up arms of the ocean joined islands to continents.
       Water: whether by the invasion or retreat of the oceans in
certain coastal areas; whether by collapses, which, holding back
the course of the waters, formed lakes; whether by overflowing
and inundation; or whether by deposits that formed at the mouths
of rivers. In drawing back the ocean, these deposits formed new
regions: such is the origin of the Nile delta in Lower Egypt, and
the Rhone or Camargue delta.

               The Age of the Mountains
       3. By examining the terrains torn up by the upthrust of the
mountains and the layers that formed the foothills, it is possible to
determine their geological age. By geological age of the mountains
one ought not to understand it to mean the number of years of their
existence, but rather the period during which they were formed,
and, therefore, their relative ancientness. It would be erroneous to
believe that this ancientness corresponds to their height or to their
exclusively granitic nature, since the granite mass, upon being thrust
up, could have perforated and separated the superposed layers.
       Thus, it has been established by observation that the
mountains of Vosges in Brittany, and Côte-d’Or in France – none
of which are very high – belong to the oldest formations. These date
from the transition period and formed prior to the coal deposits.
The Juras formed during the middle of the secondary period and
were contemporaneous with the giant reptiles. The Pyrenees formed


                                   184

                             The Transformations of the Globe


much later, toward the beginning of the tertiary period. Mont Blanc
and the western Alps came after the Pyrenees and date from the
middle of the tertiary period. The eastern Alps, which include the
mountains of Tyrol, are even more recent because they formed only
toward the end of the tertiary period. Some of the mountains in Asia
are posterior to the diluvial period or are contemporaneous with it.
      These upheavals must have caused huge localized disturbances
and more or less considerable floods due to the displacement of
the waters and the interruption and change of river courses.85

                              The Biblical Flood
       4. The biblical flood, also designated by the name “great
Asiatic flood,” was an event whose occurrence cannot be contested. It
must have been caused by the upthrust of a part of the mountains in
that region similar to what happened in Mexico. What has arisen in
support of this opinion is the existence of an inland sea, which once
extended from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean, and which has
been confirmed by geological investigations. The Azov and Caspian
Seas, whose waters are salty, although they are not connected to any
other sea, and the Aral Sea, along with countless lakes scattered over

85
     “The last century [18th] offered a noteworthy example of a phenomenon of this type.
     In 1750, at a six-day hike from Mexico City, there was a fertile and well-cultivated area,
     where rice, corn and bananas were grown in abundance. During June, awful earthquakes
     constantly shook the ground for two whole months. On the night of September 28, the
     ground was shook by a violent convulsion; an area several miles across began to gradually
     rise and wound up reaching a height of 500 feet over an area of 10 square leagues [30 square
     miles]. The ground rolled like the waves of the ocean under the wind of a storm; thousands
     of mounds alternately rose and sank. Finally, a rift of nearly 3 leagues [9 miles] opened up;
     smoke, fire, red-hot rocks and ash shot up to a prodigious height. Six mountains rose up out
     of this enormous fissure, among which was the volcano given the name of Jorullo, which
     now rises 550 meters [app. 1,800 feet] above the ancient plain. At the time in which the
     ground began to shake, the Cuitimba and San Pedro Rivers flowed backward and flooded
     the entire plain that is now occupied by Jorullo; however, in the area that continued to rise,
     an abyss opened and swallowed them up. They reappeared to the west at a point far from
     their old banks.” (Louis Figuier, La Terre avant le déluge) – Auth.



                                                185

                                       Genesis - Chapter IX


the immense plains of Tartary and the Russian Steppes, seem to
be what remain of this ancient sea. At the time of the thrusting up
of the Caucasus Mountains after the universal flood, a portion of
these waters retreated north toward the Artic Ocean, while the other
flowed south toward the Indian Ocean. These inundations flooded
and ravaged Mesopotamia and the entire region inhabited by the
ancestors of the Hebrew people. Although this flood extended over
quite a large area, it is acknowledged today that it was only local;
that it could not have been caused by rain, no matter how heavy
and continuous it might have been for forty days, since calculations
have proven that the quantity of water that fell could not have been
sufficient to cover all the earth up to the tops of the highest mountains.
       Consequently, since the flood invaded all the lands known
to them, the people at the time, who knew only about a very
small fraction of the globe’s surface, and who had no idea of its
configuration, must have thought that it affected the whole earth.
If to this belief we add the imaginative and hyperbolic descriptive
form peculiar to the oriental style, the exaggeration of the biblical
narrative comes as no surprise.
      5. The Asiatic flood is obviously posterior to the appearance
of humans on the earth, since the memory of it has been preserved
in the traditions of all that part of the world’s peoples, who have
consecrated it in their theogonies.86 87

     1991, op. cit.). – Tr.

     According to the Vedas, the Indian legend about the flood says that Brahma, transforming
     himself into a fish, approached the pious monarch Vaïvaswata and said to him: “The time
     for the ending of the universe has come. Soon, everything on earth shall be destroyed. You
     must build a ship, which you shall board after having loaded it with seeds of all the plants.
     You must await me in this ship and I will come to you, bearing on my head a horn that will
     enable you to recognize me.” The saint obeyed, built a ship, boarded it and attached it with a
     very strong cable to the horn of the fish. The ship was towed for many years at a great speed
     in the midst of the darkness of a dreadful storm, finally coming to rest on the top of Mount
     Himawat (in the Himalayas). Brahma then ordered Vaïvaswata to raise all living beings and to
     repopulate the earth. The similarity of this legend to the biblical narrative of Noah is striking.

                         The Transformations of the Globe


      The Asiatic flood is also posterior to the great universal
flood, which marked the beginning of the present geological
period; when we speak of antediluvian humans and animals, it is
to be understood as referring to that first cataclysm.

                   Periodic Transformations
       6. Besides its annual movement around the sun, which
produces the seasons, and its 24-hour rotational movement, which
produces day and night, the earth has a third movement, which it
completes in approximately 25,000 years (more precisely, 25,868),
and which produces the phenomenon designated in astronomy by
the name Precession of the Equinoxes (see chap. V, no. 11).
       This movement, which would be impossible to explain in
only a few words, without figures and a geometric demonstration,
consists in a sort of circular oscillation, which has been compared to
that of the spin of a toy top slowing down, by which the earth’s axis,
changing in inclination, describes a double cone whose tip is at the
earth’s center and whose bases take up the surface circumscribed by
the polar circles, that is, an area of a 23 ½ degree radius.
      7. The equinox is the moment in which the sun, in passing
from one hemisphere to the other, is perpendicular to the equator.
This happens twice per year: around March 21st, when the sun
returns to the northern hemisphere, and around September 22,
when it returns to the southern.
      However, as a result of the gradual change in the axis’ slant,
which causes another in the slant of the equator on the ecliptic,
the moment of the equinox advances a few minutes (25 minutes,

 From India it passed on to Egypt, along with a multitude of other beliefs, and since the book
 of the Vedas predates that of Moses, the record of the former cannot be an imitation of the
 latter. It is therefore probable that the Mosaic writer, who had studied the doctrines of the
 Egyptian priests, drew his doctrine from theirs. – Auth.



                                           187

7 seconds) each year. This advance is what is called the precession of
the equinoxes (from the Latin procedere, to move forward, combined
from proe, forward, and cedere, to go).
       Over time, these few minutes add up to hours, days, months
and years, with the result that the spring equinox, which now
arrives in March, will, at a given time, arrive in February, then
in January, then in December. Then, December will have the
temperature of March, March that of June, and so forth, until
arriving back at March; at this point things will once again be
in their current state, which will take place in 25,868 years, to
recommence the same revolution indefinitely.88
       8. The result of this conical movement of the axis is that the
earth’s poles do not constantly look at the same points in the sky;
that the North Star will not always be the North Star; and that the
poles will gradually incline varying degrees toward the sun and will
receive varying degrees of direct rays from it. Thus, it follows that
Iceland and Lapland, for example, which are below the Artic Circle,
could at a given time receive solar rays as if they were on the latitude
of Spain and Italy, and that, in the extreme opposite position, Spain
and Italy could have the temperature of Iceland and Lapland, and
so on and so forth with each renewal of the 25,000-year period.89
      9. The consequences of this movement have not yet been
determined precisely, because it has been possible to observe only a
88
     The precession of the equinoxes leads to another change, which operates on the position of the
     signs of the Zodiac. The earth revolves around the sun in one year, and as it advances, the sun
     each month faces a different constellation. There are twelve of these constellations: Aires, Taurus,
     Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. They are called
     Zodiac constellations or signs of the Zodiac, and they form a circle on earth’s equatorial plane.
     According to the month in which an individual is born, it is said that he or she was born under such
     and such sign; hence, the prognostications of astrology. However, due to the precession of the
     equinoxes, it just so happens that the months no longer correspond to the same constellations. A
     person born in the month of July is no longer under the sign of Leo, but that of Cancer. Thus falls
     the superstitious notion connected to the influence of the signs (see chap. V, no. 12). – Auth.
89
     The gradual displacement of the isothermal lines, a phenomenon recognized by science as
     positively as the displacement of the ocean, is a material fact supporting this theory – Auth.

                           The Transformations of the Globe


small part of its revolution. Therefore, regarding this subject there have
been only presumptions, some of which have a certain probability.
       Such consequences are:
       1) The alternating heating and cooling of the poles and,
consequently, the melting of the polar icecaps during half of the
25,000-year period, and their formation again during the other half,
with the result that the poles would not be doomed to perpetual
barrenness, but would in turn enjoy the benefits of fertility.
       2) The gradual dislocation of the ocean, slowly invading the
lands while uncovering others, to abandon them again and reenter
its former sea floor. This periodic movement, renewed again and
again, would constitute a true 25,000-year universal tide.
       The slowness at which this movement of the ocean occurs
makes it almost imperceptible to each generation, but it becomes
discernable at the end of several centuries. It cannot cause any
kind of sudden cataclysm, because humans retreat generation after
generation as the ocean advances, and they advance into lands
from which the ocean has withdrawn. It is more than probable
that some scholars attribute to this cause the ocean’s withdrawal
from certain coasts and its invasion of others.
        10. The slow, gradual and periodic dislocation of the ocean
is a fact proven by experience and attested to by numerous examples
on all points of the globe. Its consequence is the upkeep of the
productive capacity of the earth. This long immersion is a time of
repose, during which submersed lands recoup the vital principles
that have been exhausted by a no less lengthy time of production.
The huge deposits of organic matter, formed by the stay of the
waters for centuries and centuries, are natural fertilizers that are
renewed periodically, and generations go by without perceiving
such changes.90
90
     Among the most recent occurrences proving the dislocation of the ocean, we may cite
     the following: when the ocean in the Gulf of Gascony [France] – between old Soulac and



                                            189

                           Future Cataclysms
      11. The great upheavals on the earth occurred at the time in
which its solid crust, due to its thinness, offered only weak resistance
to the effervescence of the fiery matter in its interior. One can see
that such disturbances diminished in intensity and generality as
the crust consolidated. Numerous volcanoes are now extinct, while
others were covered over by terrains that formed afterward.
      Of course, localized disturbances might still be caused as
a result of volcanic eruptions, the emergence of new volcanoes
and the sudden flooding of certain regions. A few islands might
emerge from the ocean and others might sink, but the time
of widespread cataclysms such as those that signaled the great
geological periods has passed. The earth has taken a position,
which, although not completely unchanging, has, from now on,
placed the human species under protection from generalized
 the tower of Cordouan – is calm, one can see segments of a wall on the bottom. These
 are the remains of the ancient and great city of Noviomagus, which was invaded by the
 waves in 580 A.D. The rock of Cordouan, which was then connected to the shore, is now 12
 kilometers [7 miles] away. In the English Channel, on the coast of Le Havre, the ocean gains
 ground daily and is undermining the cliffs of Sainte-Adresse, which are crumbling little by
 little. Two kilometers [app. 1.5 miles] from the coast, between Sainte-Adresse and Cap de
 la Heve [Cape la Hague], the embankment of Eclat can be found, which in times gone by
 had been exposed and connected to dry land. Ancient documents state that upon that
 site, which is sailed over nowadays, there was a town called St. Denis-Chef-de-Caux. The
 sea invaded the land in the 14th century and the church was engulfed in 1378. It is stated
 that in good weather one can see its remains on the ocean bottom.
 Along almost the entire length of Holland’s coastline, the ocean is contained solely by the
 strength of dikes, which break from time to time. The ancient Lake Flevo, which rejoined
 the ocean in 1225, today forms the Gulf of Zuyder Zee. This invasion by the ocean engulfed
 a number of towns. According to these occurrences, the territory of Paris and of France will
 someday be once again occupied by the ocean, as it already has been many times, as proven by
 geological observations. The mountainous parts will form islands like today’s Jersey, Guernsey
 and England, previously all contiguous to the continent. Then, it will be possible to sail over
 areas that today are traveled by railroads. Ships will reach Montmartre, Mont Valerien, and the
 hills of Saint-Cloud and Meudon. The woods and forests, through which we now stroll, will be
 buried under the waters, covered with silt and populated with fish instead of birds. The biblical
 flood could not have had the same cause, since in its case the invasion by the waters was
 sudden and of short duration; otherwise, that duration would have lasted for many thousands
 of years, and would still be the case today, without humans being aware of it. – Auth.

disturbances – with the exception of causes alien to our globe,
which nothing could predict.
       2. As for comets, today we are fully assured of their more
beneficial rather than damaging influence, since they seem destined
to revitalize the worlds, if we may put it like that, by taking to
them the vital principles they have acquired during their travels
through space and in the neighborhood of suns. They would thus
be sources of prosperity rather than messengers of misfortune.
       Due to their fluidic nature, currently well-proven, (see chap.
VI, nos. 28 ff.), a violent collision is not to be feared, because if
one of them has a close encounter with the earth, the earth would
pass through the comet as if through a fog.
       Their tail is even less to be feared; it is nothing but the
reflection of solar light on the immense atmosphere that surrounds
them, as it is constantly turned away from the sun and changes
direction according to the position of this heavenly body. Due to
the speed of its travel, this gaseous matter might well form a type
of mane similar to the wake behind a ship, or the smoke of a
locomotive. Furthermore, many comets have already come close
to earth without causing any damage, and, due to their respective
densities, the earth would actually exert a greater attraction over
the comet than the comet over the earth. Only a vestige of old
preconceptions could inspire fear over their presence.91
       13. It is also necessary to relegate to the arena of absurd
hypotheses the possible encounter of the earth with another planet. The
regularity and invariability of the laws that preside over the movements
of heavenly bodies remove all probabilities of such an encounter.
       Nevertheless, the earth will have an end. How? This still
remains in the realm of conjecture; however, since it is still far away

     The comet of 1861 passed through the earth’s orbit at 20 hour’s distance ahead of the
     planet, which became immersed in its atmosphere without any resultant accident. – Auth.

from the perfection that it can reach and the old age that would
signal its decline, its current inhabitants can rest assured that it will
not happen during their lifetime. (See chap. VI, nos. 48 ff )
       14. Physically, the earth experienced the convulsions of
childhood; it henceforth entered a period of relative stability:
that of a calm progress, accomplished by the regular return of
the same physical phenomena and the intelligent cooperation of
humankind. However, it is still in the midst of the task of giving
rise to moral progress. Therein shall lie the cause of its greatest
disturbances. Until humankind has progressed sufficiently in
perfection through intelligence and the practice of the divine laws, the
greatest disturbances will be events caused by human beings more than
by nature; that is, they will be moral and social rather than physical.

 The Increase or Decrease in the Earth’s Size
       15. Does earth’s size increase, decrease or remain the same?
       In support of the increase in the earth’s size, some individuals
base their position on the notion that plants are adding more to
the soil than they are taking from it, which in one sense is correct,
but not in another. Plants nourish themselves as much, or even
more, from the gaseous substances they draw from the atmosphere
than from those they extract through their roots. The atmosphere
makes up an integral part of the globe; the gases that constitute
it come from the decomposition of solid bodies, which, upon
recomposing, take back from the atmosphere what they released
into it. This is an exchange, or rather, a perpetual transformation;
the increase of plants and animals is carried out through the
constitutive elements of the globe, and as such, their remains, as
considerable as they may be, do not add one atom to the mass. If
the solid part of the globe were to continuously increase due to


                                  192

                     The Transformations of the Globe


such a cause, it would be at the expense of the atmosphere, which
would decrease proportionally and would end up being unsuitable
for life if it did not recover through the decomposition of solid
bodies what it lost through their composition.
        At earth’s origin, the first geological strata were formed from solid
matter momentarily volatilized by the effect of the high temperature,
and which later, condensed by the cooling, fell as precipitation.
Undoubtedly, they raised the surface of the ground a little, but
without adding anything to the overall mass, since it was nothing but
a displacement of matter. Once the atmosphere was purged of the
foreign elements that had been in suspension to arrive at a normal
state, things began to follow the regular course they took thereafter.
Today, the least modification in the atmosphere’s composition would
lead to the destruction of the earth’s current inhabitants, but new races
would probably form under different conditions.
        Considered from this point of view, the globe’s mass, i.e.,
the sum of the molecules that comprise the whole of its solid,
liquid and gaseous parts, has incontestably been the same since
its origin. If it were to experience a dilation or condensation, its
size would increase or decrease without its mass undergoing any
change. However, if the earth did increase in mass, it would have
to be the effect of some outside cause, since it could not draw from
itself the elements needed for its own growth.
        According to one theory, the globe will increase in mass and
volume by the influx of interplanetary cosmic matter. There is nothing
irrational about this idea, but it is too hypothetical to be accepted in
principle. It is no more than one theory fought by opposing theories,
none of which science has yet settled on. Regarding this subject, let
us hear the opinion of the eminent spirit who dictated the scholarly
uranographic studies described above in chapter VI:
        “Worlds become exhausted as they age and tend to dissolve in
order to serve as elements for the formation of other worlds. Little by


                                    193

                                     Genesis - Chapter IX


little, they return to the universal cosmic fluid of space, which they
themselves took in order to form. Furthermore, all bodies become
spent due to attrition; the rapid and incessant movement of the globe
through the cosmic fluid has the effect of continuously decreasing its
mass, although of an indiscernible quantity over a given time.92
         “As I see it, the existence of worlds is divided into three periods.
First period: the condensation of matter, during which the globe’s size
decreases considerably while its mass remains the same; this is the period
of its infancy. Second period: the contraction and solidification of the
crust; the eclosion of prototypes and the development of life up to the
appearance of the most perfectible biotype. At this moment, the globe is
in all its plenitude; it is the age of adulthood. It loses, though very little, its
constitutive elements. As its inhabitants progress spiritually, it passes on
to the period of material decrease. It suffers loss not only due to attrition,
but also due to the disaggregation of its molecules – like a hard stone
which, eroded by time, ends up falling into dust. In its dual movement
of rotation and translation, it leaves fluidic bits of its substance in space
until the moment in which its dissolution is complete.
         “However, since its force of attraction is due to its mass – I am
not referring to size – as the globe’s mass decreases, its conditions for
equilibrium in space are modified. Overpowered by more massive
planets against which it can no longer act as a counterweight,
it suffers deflections in its movements, and as a result, there are
profound changes in the conditions for life on its surface. Thus:
birth, life and death; or infancy, adulthood, and decrepitude; these
are the three phases through which every agglomeration of organic
or inorganic matter passes. Only the spirit, which is not matter at
all, is indestructible.” (Galileo, Parisian Society, 1868)

92
     In its orbit around the sun, the earth’s velocity is about 400 leagues [1,200 miles (1,930

     The First Formation of Living Beings
       1. There was a time when there were no animals; thus,
they had a beginning. Each species appeared to the degree that
the globe acquired the conditions necessary for its existence – that
is certain. How were the first biotypes of each species formed? We
can understand that once the first couple appeared, individuals
multiplied. But where did this first couple come from? This is
one of those mysteries connected to the beginning of things and
about which one can only make hypotheses. If science cannot yet
completely resolve the problem, it can at least point the way.
       2. One of the first questions that arise is the following: Did
each animal species come from a primary couple or from many
couples created, or, if you will, germinated simultaneously in
different places?
       This latter supposition is the most probable; we might
even say that it results from observation. In fact, the study of the
geological layers attests to the presence – in terrains of similar


                                195

                         Genesis - Chapter X


formation and across vast areas – of the same species on the
farthest apart points of the globe. Such generalized and somewhat
contemporaneous multiplication would have been impossible
with one single primitive type.
       Additionally, the life of one individual, especially an
emerging individual, is subject to so many eventualities that an
entire creation could have been compromised if not for the plurality
of types, which would imply an unacceptable improvidence on the
part of the Supreme Creator. Moreover, if a particular type could
have been formed at one point, it could have been formed at many
points by the same cause.
       Hence, everything concurs in demonstrating that there was
a simultaneous and multiple creation of the first couples for each
animal and plant species.
      3. The formation of the first living beings may be deduced
by analogy from the same law according to which inorganic
bodies were formed and continue to be formed each and every
day. As one delves further into the laws of nature, one can see
the mechanisms, which at first seem so complicated, become
simplified and melded together in the great law of unity that
presides over the whole work of creation. This will be better
understood when one becomes aware of the formation of
inorganic bodies, which was the first step.
       4. Chemistry regards a certain number of substances as
elementary, such as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, chlorine,
iodine, fluorine, sulfur, phosphorous and all the metals. Through
their combination, they form compounds: oxides, acids, alkalis, salts
and the innumerable varieties that result from combinations of these.
       The combination of two elements to form a third requires a
particular concourse of circumstances, whether a particular degree
of heat, dryness or humidity, whether movement or rest, whether


                                196

                         The Organic Genesis


an electric current, etc. Unless these conditions are present, the
combination does not occur.
       5. When a combination does occur, the elements lose
their characteristic properties, whereas the resultant compound
possesses new and different qualities from those of the originals.
It is thus, for example, that oxygen and hydrogen, which are
invisible gases, when combined chemically form water, which is
liquid, solid or gaseous, depending on the temperature. Properly
speaking, in water there is no longer either oxygen or hydrogen,
but rather a new substance. If water is decomposed, the two gases
return to their free state, recover their own properties and there is
no longer water. The same quantity of water can thus be alternately
decomposed and recomposed ad infinitum.
       6. The composition and decomposition of substances
occur as a result of the degree of affinity the basic elements have
for one another. The formation of water, for example, results from
the mutual affinity between oxygen and hydrogen. However, if
water comes in contact with an element that has a greater affinity
for oxygen than hydrogen has, the water decomposes: the oxygen
is absorbed, the hydrogen is released and there is no longer water.
      7. Compound substances are always formed in definite
proportions, that is, by the combination of a certain quantity of
constituent elements. Hence, in order to form water, one part
oxygen and two parts hydrogen are required. If two parts oxygen
are combined with two of hydrogen, then instead of water one gets
hydrogen dioxide, a corrosive liquid, formed nonetheless from the
same elements as water, but in a different proportion.
      8. Such is, in a few words, the law that presides over the
formation of all the substances in nature. The innumerable variety
of these substances results from a small number of basic elements
combined in different proportions.

                                197

                          Genesis - Chapter X


       Thus, oxygen combined in certain proportions with carbon,
sulfur and phosphorous forms carbonic, sulfuric and phosphoric
acid; oxygen and iron form iron oxide or rust; oxygen and lead –
both harmless – form lead oxides such as litharge (lead monoxide),
white lead and red lead oxide, which are poisonous. Oxygen
combined with calcium, sodium or potassium forms lime, soda
and potash. Lime combined with carbonic acid forms calcium
carbonate or calcareous stone such as marble, chalk, sandstone,
and stalactites in caves; combined with sulfuric acid it forms
calcium sulfate or gypsum and alabaster; with phosphoric acid it
forms calcium phosphate, the main component of bone. Chlorine
and hydrogen form hydrochloric acid; chlorine and sodium form
sodium chloride or sea salt.
        9. All these combinations and thousands of others are
obtained artificially in small quantities in chemistry labs; they form
spontaneously on a large scale in the great laboratory of nature.
        At its origin, the earth did not contain these compounds but
only their volatized constituent elements. When the calcareous
terrains and others, turned stony over time, were deposited on the
earth’s surface, those elements did not exist completely formed.
However, they were contained in the air, in a gaseous state.
Having precipitated due to the cooling effect, these elements
combined under favorable conditions according to the degree
of their molecular affinity. It was then that the different varieties
of carbonates, sulfates, etc. were formed, at first dissolved in the
waters and afterwards deposited on the surface of the ground.
        Let us suppose that, for whatever reason, the earth returned
to its primitive incandescent state and everything decomposed. The
elements would separate, all fusible substances would melt, and all
those that were volatile would volatilize. Later, a second cooling
would bring about a new precipitation and the old combinations
would form once again.

                                 198

                        The Organic Genesis


      10. These considerations show how much chemistry is
necessary for the understanding of Genesis. Before the knowledge
of the law of molecular affinity, it was impossible to comprehend
how the earth formed. Chemistry has clarified the question under
a completely new light, just as astronomy and geology have from
other points of view.
       11. In the formation of solid bodies, one of the most
remarkable phenomena is crystallization, which consists in the
symmetrical form assumed by certain substances in passing from
the liquid or gaseous state to the solid state. This form, which
varies according to the nature of the substance, is usually that of
geometric solids such as the prism, the rhomboid, the cube or
the pyramid. Everyone is familiar with crystals of sugar, crystals
of rock or crystallized silica, which are six-sided prisms that end
up in an equally hexagonal pyramid. The diamond is pure carbon
or crystallized carbon. The designs that are produced on window
panes in winter are due to the crystallization of water vapor during
freezing in the form of prismatic needles.
       The regular arrangement of crystals has to do with the
particular shape of the molecules of each body. These particles,
infinitely small to us, but which nevertheless occupy a certain
amount of space, seek one another out through molecular
attraction and arrange and juxtapose themselves according to the
requirement of their shape so as to take their place around the
nucleus or initial center of attraction to form a symmetric whole.
       Crystallization occurs only under certain favorable
circumstances, apart from which it cannot take place. Temperature
and motionlessness are essential conditions. One knows that
high heat keeps the molecules apart and does not allow them to
condense, and that agitation opposes their symmetric arrangement,
yielding only a disorganized and irregular mass, differing from
crystallization per se.

                                     Genesis - Chapter X


      12. The law that presides over the formation of minerals
leads naturally to the formation of organic bodies.
      Chemical analysis shows us that all plant and animal
substances are composed of the same elements as inorganic
compounds. Of these elements, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and
carbon play a principal role, while others are found only accessorily.
As in the mineral kingdom, the difference of proportion in the
combination of these elements produces all the varieties of organic
substances and their diverse properties such as muscle, bone,
blood, bile, nerve tissue, brain matter and fat in animals; sap,
wood, leaves, fruit, essences, oils and resins, etc. in plants. Thus, in
the formation of animals and plants there is no special substance
that may not be found also in the mineral kingdom.93
      13. A few common examples will enable one to understand
the transformations that occur in the organic kingdom solely
through modification of the constitutive elements.
      In grape juice there is not yet either wine or alcohol, but
only water and sugar. When the juice matures and is placed under
the right conditions, an inner process occurs to which we give
the name of fermentation. In this process, a part of the sugar
decomposes; the oxygen, hydrogen and carbon separate and
combine in the proportions needed to produce alcohol. Thus,

     of properties that result from the difference in the proportion of the constituent elements.

                         The Organic Genesis


when we drink grape juice, we are not drinking alcohol because it
does not yet exist. It is formed from the constituents of water and
sugar, without having one more or one less molecule in all.
       In the bread and vegetables we eat there is obviously no
meat, blood, bone, bile or brain matter, and yet these same foods
decompose and recompose by means of digestion to produce those
different substances simply through the transmutation of their
constitutive elements.
       In the seed of a tree, there are no wood, leaves, blossoms or
fruit, and it would be a childish error to believe that a microscopic
form of the entire tree could be found in the seed. Moreover, there
is not nearly enough oxygen, hydrogen and carbon in the seed
to form even one tree leaf. The seed contains a prototype that
germinates when the conditions are favorable, and this prototype
thrives through the liquids it draws from the soil and the gases it
breathes from the air. These liquids, which are not stem, leaves,
blossoms or fruit, seep into the plant to form the sap, the same as
food, in animals, forms the blood. This sap is taken by circulation
to all parts of the plant, and depending on what part it arrives at
and what special preparation it undergoes, becomes stem, leaves
and fruit, just as the blood becomes flesh, bone, bile, etc. And yet,
they are always the same elements: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen
and carbon combined in various ways.
       14. The different combinations of elements needed to
form mineral, plant and animal substances cannot, therefore,
occur except in a favorable environment and circumstances. Apart
from such circumstances, the elementary principles are in a sort of
inertia. However, as soon as the circumstances become favorable,
a process of development begins; the molecules start to move, to
jiggle, to attract, approaching and separating in virtue of the law of
affinity, and through their multiple combinations, they compose
the infinite variety of substances. If such conditions cease, the

                                 201

                          Genesis - Chapter X


process stops suddenly, only to start over when the appropriate
conditions reappear. This is how plants become active, slow down,
stop and start over under the action of heat, light, humidity, cold
or dryness; that a certain plant prospers in one climate or soil, but
weakens or dies in another.
       15. What occurs daily under our very eyes can set us on the
road to what happened at the beginning of time, for the laws of
nature are invariable.
       Since the constituent elements of both organic and inorganic
beings are the same, and since we see them incessantly form rocks,
plants and fruit, one can conclude that, like the first rocks, the
bodies of the first living beings were formed by the aggregation of
elementary molecules in virtue of the law of affinity to the degree
that the conditions for life on the globe were favorable for this or
that species.
       The similarity in form and color in the reproduction of the
biotypes of each species can be compared to the similarity in the
form of each type of crystal. Juxtaposed under the influence of the
same law, the molecules produce an analogous whole.

                    The Vital Principle
       16. In stating that plants and animals are formed from the
same basic constituents as minerals, one must understand it in an
exclusively material sense; moreover, it is an issue that relates solely
to the body.
       Without speaking of the intelligent principle, which is a
separate concept altogether, there is in organic matter a special,
elusive principle, which has not yet been defined: the vital
principle. This principle, active in the living being and extinct in
the dead one, gives to substance the characteristic properties that


                                  202

                          The Organic Genesis


distinguish it from inorganic substances. The chemical processes
that decompose and recompose the greater part of inorganic bodies
can decompose organic bodies as well, but have never succeeded
at recomposing even one dead leaf, obvious proof that in organic
bodies there is something that is non-existent in the others.
       17. Is the vital principle something distinct with an
existence of its own? Or rather, going back to the theory of a sole
generative element, is the vital principle a particular state, one
of the modifications of the universal cosmic fluid, which then
becomes the life principle, just as it becomes light, fire, heat or
electricity? It is in this last sense that the issue has been resolved
through the communications quoted earlier in the book. (See
chap. VI, General Uranography)
       Whatever one’s opinion may be on the nature of the vital
principle, however, it does exist, because we see its effects. One can
therefore logically admit that as organic beings are formed they
assimilate the vital principle that is necessary for their purpose; or if
we prefer, that this principle develops in each individual by the same
effect of the combination of the elements, much like we see heat, light
and electricity develop under the influence of certain circumstances.
       18. If oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon combine
without the vital fluid, they form only a mineral or inorganic body;
the vital principle modifies the molecular composition of that
body to give it special properties. Instead of a mineral molecule
one has an organic molecule.
       The activity of the vital principle is maintained during life
by the activity of the organs, just as heat is maintained by the
rotating movement of a wheel. When this action ceases because
of death, the vital principle is extinguished like the heat when the
wheel stops turning. However, the effect produced on the molecular
state of the body by the vital principle persists after the extinction


                                  203

                          Genesis - Chapter X


of the principle, just as the carbonization of wood persists after the
extinction of the heat. In the analysis of organic bodies, chemistry
recovers the constituent elements: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and
carbon, but it cannot reconstruct these bodies because the cause
no longer exists; hence, it cannot reproduce the effect, whereas it
can reconstitute a stone.
        19. We have taken for comparison the heat produced by the
movement of a wheel because it is a commonplace effect, familiar
to all and easy to understand. However, it would be more precise
to say that, in the combination of elements to form organic bodies,
electricity is produced. Organic bodies would thus be veritable
electric batteries, which function as long as the components of
these batteries can sustain the conditions required to produce
electricity, that is, life; and which stop when such conditions cease,
that is, death. According to this, the vital principle would be but
a particular type of electricity called animal electricity, released
during life by the activity of the organs, and whose production
ceases upon death by the cessation of such action.

               Spontaneous Generation
        20. One might of course ask why living beings no longer
form under the same conditions in which the first ones appeared
on the earth.
        The question of spontaneous generation, with which science
is still preoccupied today, although solved differently, cannot help
but cast light on the subject. The proposed problem is this: are
organic beings nowadays formed spontaneously by the sole union
of constituent elements, without prototypes produced beforehand
by ordinary methods of generation; in other words, without fathers
or mothers?


                                 204

                                    The Organic Genesis


       The supporters of spontaneous generation respond in the
affirmative and support themselves on direct observations that seem
to be conclusive. Others think that all living beings are reproduced
by one another and support themselves on the fact that experience
has proven that when the prototypes of certain plant and animal
species are scattered about, they can retain a latent vitality for a
considerable amount of time, until circumstances are favorable for
their eclosion. This opinion always leaves open the question of the
formation of the first types of each species.
       21. Without discussing the two theories, one should note
that the principle of spontaneous generation can obviously apply
only to beings of the lowest orders of the plant and animal kingdoms,
to those in which the manifestation of life begins, whose extremely
simple organism is somewhat rudimentary. In fact, these are the
first beings that appeared on the earth, and whose generation had
to have been spontaneous. We would therefore be witnessing an
ongoing creation analogous to that which took place during the
earliest ages of the world.
       22. So then, why do we not see beings of a more complex
organization form in the same way? Such beings have not always
existed – this is a positive fact – so they must have had a beginning.
If the moss, the lichen, the zoophyte, the infusoria94, the intestinal
worms and others can be produced spontaneously, why could not
the same happen with trees, fish, dogs or horses?
       Here, investigations have stopped for the time being. The
guide wire has been lost and until it is found again, the field is
open to hypotheses. It would thus be imprudent and premature to
take mere theories as absolute truths.

94
     One of the classes of Protozoa, including a large number of species, all of minute size.
     Formerly, the term was applied to any microbe found in infusions of decaying organic
     material, but the term is now applied more specifically to one of the classes of the phylum
     Ciliophora, of ciliated protozoa. (Webster’s, 1913) – Tr.

                                  Genesis - Chapter X


      23. If spontaneous generation is an established fact,
as limited as it may be, it is no less a crucial one, a landmark
pointing the way to new observations. If complex organic beings
are not produced in this manner, who knows how they started?
Who knows the secret of all transformations? When one sees an
oak sprout from an acorn, who could say that some mysterious
tie might not also exist between the polyp and the elephant?
(See no. 25).
      In the current state of our knowledge, we cannot present the
theory of ongoing spontaneous generation except as a hypothesis,
although a probable one, and which may someday take its place
among recognized scientific truths.95

                  The Scale of Organic Beings
       24. There is no clearly marked out delimitation between
the plant and animal kingdoms. Outside the confines of the two
kingdoms are the zoophytes or animal-plants, whose name indicates
that they have a little of each: it represents the link between both.
       Like animals, plants are born, live, grow, draw nourishment,
breathe, reproduce and die. Like animals, they need light, warmth
and water to live; if they are deprived of these elements, they
languish and die. The absorption of noxious air and deleterious
substances poisons them. Their most distinctive characteristic is
that they are bound to the soil and extract their nutrition from it
without moving about.
       The zoophyte has the outward appearance of a plant. Like
the plant, it is attached to the soil; like the animal, life in it is
more accentuated – it draws its nourishment from the ambient
environment.

                         The Organic Genesis


       A step higher, the animal is free and goes in search of its
nourishment. First, there are the innumerable varieties of polyps
with gelatinous bodies, without well-defined organs, and which
differ from plants only because of their locomotion. Next in the
order of development of organs, vital activity and instinct come
the helminthes or intestinal worms; the mollusks, fleshy animals
without bones, some of which are naked, such as the gastropods
and octopi, whereas others bear shells, such as the snails and
oysters; the crustaceans, whose skin is covered with a hard crust,
such as the crab and lobster; the insects, in which life takes on
a prodigious activity and in which an industrious instinct often
manifests, such as in the ant, bee and spider. Some undergo a
metamorphosis, such as the chrysalis that becomes an elegant
butterfly. Then comes the order of the vertebrates – animals with
bony skeletons – which includes the fish, reptiles, birds and finally
the mammals, whose organization is the most complete.
       25. If we consider only the two extreme ends of the chain,
there is obviously no apparent analogy; but if one goes from one
link to the next without breaking continuity, one goes from plants
to vertebrates without a brusque transition. One understands
therefore that animals of a complex organization could be but
a transformation, or if one prefers, a gradual development,
imperceptible at first, from the species immediately before, and
so on, step by step, all the way down to the elementary primitive
being. The difference between the acorn and the oak is enormous,
yet if one follows step by step the development from the acorn,
one will arrive at the oak and will marvel that it has come from
such a small seed. Now, if the acorn contains the appropriate latent
elements for the formation of a giant tree, why could it not be the
same from the mite to the elephant? (See no. 23)
       From this, we understand that there is spontaneous generation
only for elementary organic beings; more complex species would be

                                207

                          Genesis - Chapter X


the product of successive transformations among these same beings
as climatic conditions became suitable. As each species acquired the
faculty to reproduce, cross-breeding led to innumerable varieties.
And subsequently, once the species became established and
sustainable, who is to say that the primitive prototype from which it
came did not disappear as useless henceforth? Who is to say that our
present-day mite is the same as the one that, mutation by mutation,
has produced the elephant? Thus it could be explained why there is
no spontaneous generation among complex animals. This theory,
though not accepted as definitive, is the one that prevails in science
today; it is regarded by serious observers as the most rational.

                       Human Beings
       26. From the corporeal and purely anatomical point of
view, humans belong to the class of mammals, differing from them
only by nuances in their outward appearance; furthermore, they
are of the same chemical composition as all animals, and have the
same organs, the same functions, and the same modes of nutrition,
breathing, secretion and reproduction; they are born, live and die
under the same conditions, and at death their body decomposes
just as those of everything else that lives. In their blood, flesh and
bones there is not one atom different from those found in the
body of animals; like them, upon dying, the oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen and carbon that had combined to form them return to
the earth, and through new combinations will form mineral, plant
and animal bodies once more. The analogy is so close that one can
study the organic functions of certain animals when experiments
cannot be performed on actual human beings.
      27. In the class of mammals, human beings belong to the
biped order. Immediately below them are the quadrupeds (animals


                                 208

                         The Organic Genesis


with four legs) or apes, some of which, such as the orangutan
and the chimpanzee, display certain human-like behaviors, so
much so that for a long time they were designated by the name
jungle men; like humans, they walk upright, use a stick, construct
their shelters and take food to their mouth with their hands – all
human-like characteristics.
       28. However little one might observe the scale of living
beings from the point of view of their organisms, one realizes
that, from the lichen to the tree, and then from the zoophyte to
the human being, there is an unbroken gradual chain in which
all the links have a point of contact with the preceding one; in
following the series of beings step by step, it may be said that each
species is an improvement, a transformation of the one immediately
beneath it. Since the human body is under identical conditions as
other bodies chemically and constitutionally, that it is born, lives,
and dies in the same way, it must have been formed under the
same conditions.
        29. Whatever the impact on their pride, humans must
resign themselves to seeing in their physical bodies nothing but the
last link of animality on the earth. The inexorable argument of the
facts is in plain sight, against which it is useless to protest.
        However, the more the body decreases in value in their eyes,
the more the spiritual principle increases in importance. If the
former places them on the level of the animal, the latter raises
them to an immeasurable height. We see the circle within which
the animal is contained; we do not see the limit that can be reached
by the human spirit.
      30. Materialism can see in that fact that Spiritism, far from
fearing the discoveries of science and its positivism, moves forward
and encourages them because it is sure that the spiritual principle,
which has its own existence, cannot suffer any damage.


                                209

                         Genesis - Chapter X


       Spiritism walks hand in hand with materialism on the terrain
of matter; it accepts everything that materialism accepts; but at the
point where materialism stops, Spiritism goes farther. Spiritism
and materialism are like two travelers who journey together from
the same starting point; having gone a certain distance, one says, “I
cannot go any farther,” while the other continues on his way and
discovers a new world. Why, then, would the former say that the
latter is mad simply because, in seeing new horizons, he wants to
go beyond the limits in which it is proper for the former to stop?
Was not Christopher Columbus also regarded as crazy because
he believed in a world beyond the ocean? How often has not
history told of such sublime madmen who enabled humankind to
advance, and for whom we braid garlands after we pushed them
into the mud?
       Well then! Spiritism, that madness of the 19th century –
according to those who wish to remain on the terrestrial shore –
uncovers a whole world to us, a world much more important for
humankind than the Americas because not everyone goes to the
Americas, whereas all, without exception, go to the spirit world,
making continuous journeys from one to the other.
       Having come to this point within Genesis, materialism
stops, whereas Spiritism carries on with its research in the realm of
the spiritual Genesis.

                 The Spiritual Principle
        1. The existence of the spiritual principle is a fact which,
so to speak, has no more need of demonstration than the material
principle. To some extent, it is an axiomatic truth: it is affirmed by
its effects, just as matter is affirmed by its own effects.
        According to the principle, “Since every effect has a cause,
every intelligent effect must have an intelligent cause,” there is
no one who cannot tell the difference between the mechanical
movement of a bell rattled by the wind and the movement of this
same bell meant as a signal or a warning, thereby attesting to a
thought, an intent behind it. Now, since it would not occur to
anyone to attribute the thought to the physical matter comprising
the bell, one must conclude that it was moved by an intelligence
that used it as an instrument to manifest itself.
        For the same reason, it would not occur to anyone to
attribute thought to the corpse of a dead person. If living persons

                                 211

                          Genesis - Chapter XI


think, it is because there is something within them that is no
longer there when they are dead. The difference between living
persons and the bell is that the intelligence that makes the latter
move is outside of it, whereas the intelligence that causes the
former to act is within them.
       2. The spiritual principle is the corollary of the existence of
God. Without this principle, God would have no reason to exist,
since one could no more conceive of the supreme intelligence
reigning solely over brute matter throughout eternity than an
earthly monarch reigning solely over stones throughout his or
her life. Since it is not possible to accept a God apart from one
possessing the essential attributes of the Divinity, that is, justice
and goodness, such attributes would be worthless if they were
exerted solely on matter.
       3. On the other hand, one could not conceive of a supremely
just and good God creating intelligent and sensible beings in order
to consign them to nothingness after a few days of uncompensated
suffering, gazing upon that unending succession of beings who are
born without having been asked to be, who think for an instant
in order to know nothing but pain, and who then cease to exist
forever after an ephemeral existence.
       Without the survival after death of the thinking being, the
suffering of life would be a purposeless cruelty on God’s part. That is
why materialism and atheism are corollaries of each other: denying
the cause, they cannot accept the effect; denying the effect, they
cannot accept the cause. Materialism therefore becomes plausible
to itself, but it is not plausible to reason.
      4. The idea of the perpetuity of the spiritual being is innate
in human beings; it exists within them as an intuition, a yearning.
They understand that the compensation for the miseries of life
lies only in the perpetuity of the spiritual being, which is why


                                  212

                          The Spiritual Genesis


there always have been and always will be more spiritualists than
materialists, and more theists than atheists.
       To the intuitive idea and the power of reasoning, Spiritism
adds the sanction of the spirit phenomena, that is, the physical
proof of the existence of the spiritual being, its survival after death,
its immortality and its individuality. Spiritism renders precise and
definite what used to be a vague and abstract idea. It shows us the
intelligent being acting outside of matter, whether after or during
the life of the body.
       5. Are the spiritual principle and the vital principle one and
the same thing?
       Starting, as always, from the observation of the facts, we
will state that, if the vital principle were inseparable from the
intelligent principle, there would be good reason to confuse the
two. However, because there are beings that live but do not think,
such as plants, human bodies that are still animated with organic
life while there is no manifestation of thought, vital movements
that are produced in living beings independent of any act of their
will, and organic life that during sleep is preserved in full activity
while mental life does not manifest itself by any outward sign, we
should conclude that there are grounds to believe that organic life
per se resides in a principle inherent to matter, independent of
the spiritual life that is inherent to the spirit. Since matter has a
vitality independent of the spirit, and since the spirit has a vitality
independent of matter, it is obvious that this two-fold vitality rests
upon two different principles. (See chap. X, nos. 16-19)
       6. Might the spiritual principle have its source in the universal
cosmic element? Might it not be only a transformation, a mode of
existence of that element, such as light, electricity, heat, etc.?
       If that were the case, the spiritual principle would undergo
the vicissitudes of matter and it would be extinguished through


                                  213

                         Genesis - Chapter XI


disaggregation just as the vital principle is. The intelligent being
would have only a momentary existence like the body, and at death
it would return to nothingness, or to the universal whole, which
would amount to the same thing. In other words, this would be
the sanction of materialist doctrines.
       The sui generis properties that are recognized in the spiritual
principle prove that it has its own independent existence, since
if its origin were in matter, it would lack such properties. Since
intelligence and thought cannot be attributes of matter, by going
back from the effects to the cause, one reaches the conclusion
that the material element and the spiritual element are the
two constitutive principles of the universe. The individualized
spiritual principle constitutes the beings called spirits, while the
individualized material element constitutes the different organic
and inorganic bodies of nature.
       7. Accepting the spiritual being and the fact that its source
cannot be found in matter, then what is its origin, its point of
departure?
       Here, the means of investigation are completely lacking, just
as for everything else connected with the origin of things. Humans
can only verify what actually exists; concerning everything else,
they can formulate only hypotheses; and whether the knowledge
of human origins is beyond the reach of their present intelligence
or whether it is useless or unsuitable for them to possess it at the
moment, God has not given them such knowledge – not even
through revelation.
       What God does say to them through his messengers, and what
humans can deduce otherwise by themselves from the principle of
supreme justice – an essential attribute of the Divinity – is that
all humans have the same point of departure; that they are all
created simple and ignorant with an equal aptitude for progressing
by means of their individual activity; that they will all reach the

                                 214

                         The Spiritual Genesis


degree of perfection suitable to them through their own personal
efforts; that being children of the same Father, they are all objects
of the same consideration; and that none are more favored or more
gifted than others, nor excused from the labor that will be imposed
on everyone else to reach the goal.
       8. Just as God has created material worlds throughout all
eternity, God has also created spirit beings throughout all eternity;
otherwise, material worlds would have no objective. It would be
easier to conceive of spirit beings without material worlds than
the latter without spirit beings. It is the material worlds that
must furnish spirit beings with the elements of activity for the
development of their intelligence.
       9. Progress is the normal condition of spirit beings and
relative perfection is the goal they must reach. Now, if God
has created incessantly throughout all eternity, it follows that
throughout all eternity there also have been beings that have
reached the culminating point of the scale.
       Before the earth came into being, worlds had succeeded
worlds, and when the earth emerged from the chaos of the
elements, space was already populated with spirit beings of every
degree of advancement, from those who had just been born to
life to those who, since time immemorial, had taken their place
among the pure spirits – commonly called angels.

             The Union of the Spiritual
               Principle and Matter
      10. Before matter could be the object of labor of the spirit
for the development of its faculties, it was necessary for the spirit
to be able to act upon it, and this is why it came to dwell in it
like a lumberjack dwells in the forest. Since matter had to be

                                 215

                                     Genesis - Chapter XI


simultaneously the object and instrument of labor, God, instead of
joining the spirit to rigid stone, created organized, flexible bodies
capable of both receiving all the impulses of the spirit’s will and of
lending itself to all its movements.
       The body is therefore simultaneously the envelope and
instrument of the spirit, and as the spirit acquires new aptitudes,
it clothes itself in another envelope that is appropriate for the
new type of work that it must perform, just as less heavy tools are
employed by those capable of performing more delicate work.
        11. To be more exact, it must be stated that it is the spirit
itself that molds its own envelope and renders it adequate for its
new requirements. The spirit perfects, develops and completes
the organism to the degree that it feels the need to manifest new
faculties; in other words, it tailors it to the stature of its intelligence.
God furnishes the spirit with the materials, but it is up to the spirit
to use them. That is why advanced races have an organism, or rather,
a cerebral apparatus that is more perfected than that of primitive
races.96 This also explains the special style that the spirit’s character
imprints on the outline of the physiognomy and the appearance of
the body. (See chap. VIII, no. 7: The soul of the earth)
       12. Once a spirit is born to spiritual life, in order to
advance it must make use of its faculties, which are rudimentary
at first. For this reason, it clothes itself in a corporeal envelope
that is adequate for its state of intellectual infancy, an envelope
it leaves behind to put on another as its abilities increase. Now,
since there have been worlds throughout all time, and since
these worlds have given birth to organized bodies appropriate for
receiving spirits, likewise throughout all time, spirits – whatever
their degree of advancement – have found the elements required
for their corporeal life.

                         The Spiritual Genesis


       13. Since the body is exclusively material, it undergoes the
vicissitudes of matter. After functioning for some time, it becomes
disorganized and decomposes. Since the vital principle no longer
finds the element needed for its activity, it is extinguished and
the body dies, and since the lifeless body has become useless
henceforth, the spirit leaves it as one leaves a house that is in ruins
or clothes that are worn-out.
       14. The body therefore is nothing but an envelope meant for
receiving the spirit; thus, its origin and the materials from which it
is constructed are of little importance. Whether or not the human
body is a special creation, it is nonetheless composed of the same
elements as the body of animals; it is animated by the same vital
principle – in other words, lit by the same fire and illuminated by
the same light – and is subject to the same vicissitudes and the
same needs: there is no contesting this point.
       If we were to subtract the spirit and consider matter only,
the human being would have nothing that distinguishes it from
the animal. However, all that changes when a distinction is made
between the habitation and the inhabitant.
       A great lord, whether living under a thatched roof or
dressed in the coarse woolen clothing of a peasant, is a great lord
nonetheless. The same applies to the human being: it is not its
garment of flesh that sets it above the animal and makes it a being
apart; it is its spiritual being, its spirit.

            A Hypothesis concerning the
              Origin of Human Bodies
      15. Because of the similarity between the outward form
of the human body and that of an ape, some physiologists have
concluded that the former is only a transformation of the latter.


                                 217

                                        Genesis - Chapter XI


There is nothing impossible in this, nor would the dignity of the
human being suffer if such were the case. The bodies of apes could
very well have served as garments for the first human spirits, who
were necessarily little-advanced; for their incarnation on the earth,
these garments were more appropriate for their needs and more
adequate for the exercise of their faculties than the body of any
other animal. Instead of a special garment having to be made for
the spirit, it found one completely ready. It could therefore clothe
itself in the skin of the ape without ceasing to be a human spirit,
just as humans sometimes cover themselves in the skins of certain
animals but remain human beings.97
        It must be well understood that this is only a hypothesis,
which is in no way intended as a principle. It is given only to show
that the origin of the body does not prejudice the spirit, which is
the principal being, and that the similarity between the human
body and that of the ape does not imply parity between its spirit
and that of the ape.
        16. In accepting this hypothesis, one could say that, under
the influence and by the effect of the intellectual activity of its
new inhabitant, the envelope became modified and embellished
in its details, while retaining the general form of the whole (see no.
11). In procreating, these improved bodies reproduced displaying
the same changes, much as what occurs with grafted trees. They
gave origin to a new species that gradually pulled away from the
primitive type as the spirit progressed. The ape spirit did not
disappear, but continued to procreate ape bodies for its use – just
as the fruit of the wild plant reproduces wild plants – whereas the
human spirit continued to procreate human bodies, variants of
the first mold in which it was established. The strain bifurcated: it
produced an offshoot and this offshoot became a strain.

                          The Spiritual Genesis


        Since there are no brusque transitions in nature, it is probable
that the first humans that appeared on the earth must have differed
little from the ape in outward appearance and, undoubtedly, also
in intelligence. In our times, there are still primitives whose arm
and foot length and head conformation bear so much similarity to
that of an ape that with the addition of body hair the resemblance
would be even closer.

               The Incarnation of Spirits
       17. Spiritism teaches us how the union of the spirit and the
body occurs in incarnation.
       Due to its spiritual essence, the spirit is an indefinite,
abstract being that cannot act directly upon matter; it needs an
intermediary. This intermediary is the fluidic envelope, which
is, in a certain way, an integral part of the spirit, a semi-material
envelope, which one could say is linked to matter by its origin and
to spirituality by its ethereal nature. Like all matter, it is drawn
from the universal cosmic fluid, which, in this instance, undergoes
a special modification. This envelope, designated by the name
perispirit, makes the spirit – an abstract being – into a concrete,
definite being that is perceptible to thought. It renders it capable
of acting upon tangible matter as well as all imponderable fluids,
which, as we know, are the most powerful driving forces.
       The perispiritual fluid is therefore the link between the
spirit and matter. During its union with the body, it is the vehicle
of its thought for transmitting movement to the various parts of
the organism, which act under the impulse of its will, and for
enabling repercussion within the spirit of the sensations produced
by exterior agents. The nerves are its conducting wires, in the
same way that the metal wire is the conductor of the electric fluid
in the telegraph.


                                  219

                            Genesis - Chapter XI


        18. When the spirit must incarnate in a human body that is
about to be formed, a fluidic tie, which is nothing but an extension
of its perispirit, connects it to the zygote, to which it is attracted by
an irresistible force from the moment of conception. As the fetus
develops, the tie tightens. Under the influence of the fetus’ vital
material principle, the perispirit, which possesses certain properties
of matter, is united molecule by molecule to the body that is forming,
a fact from which one may deduce that the spirit, through the
intermediary of its perispirit, sort of takes root in the fetus, much as
a plant takes root in the soil. When the fetus is fully developed, the
union is complete and the being is born to external life.
        By an opposite effect, this union between the perispirit and
corporeal matter (a union that had been completed under the influence
of the zygote’s vital principle) terminates when this principle ceases
to act due to the disorganization of the body. This union, which had
been maintained only by an actuating force, breaks down as soon as
this force ceases to act. Then, the perispirit disengages molecule by
molecule – as when it was uniting – and the spirit is set free. Thus, it
is not the departure of the spirit that causes the death of the body; rather,
the death of the body is what causes the departure of the spirit.
        From the moment of death, the integrity of the spirit is complete;
its faculties acquire an even greater power of penetration, while the life
principle is extinguished in the body. This is obvious proof that the
vital principle and the spiritual principle are two distinct things.
       19. By enabling us to observe the phenomena that accompany
this separation, Spiritism teaches us that this separation is sometimes
quick, easy, gentle and painless; at other times it is slow, laborious
and horribly painful due to the moral state of the spirit, and it may
take entire months.
      20. One particular phenomenon, also pointed out through
observation, always accompanies the incarnation of the spirit.


                                    220

                          The Spiritual Genesis


Since the spirit is held by the fluidic tie that attaches it to the fetus,
confusion seizes it; this confusion increases as the tie strengthens, and
during the last moments, the spirit loses all self-awareness so that it is
never a conscious witness of its own birth. The moment the newborn
breathes, the spirit begins to recover its faculties, which develop as the
organs that are to serve for their manifestation form and consolidate.
       21. However, at the same time that the spirit recovers
its self-awareness, it loses the memory of its past, but without
losing the faculties, qualities and aptitudes that it had acquired
previously, aptitudes which had remained temporarily in a latent
state, and which, upon resuming their activity, will help the
spirit do more and do better than what it did in its previous
incarnation. It picks up its previous work where it left off; it is for
it a new departure point, a new step to climb. Here, the Creator’s
goodness is once again expressed, since the remembrance of an
often painful or humiliating past, if added to the heartaches
of its new existence, could trouble and hamper it. Instead, it
remembers only what it has learned because it is useful. If it
sometimes retains a vague intuition of past events, it is like the
remembrance of a fleeting dream. Therefore, this is indeed a
new person despite how old the spirit might be. It leans on new
experiences aided by its earlier acquisitions. When it returns to
the spirit life, its past unfolds before it and it can then determine
whether it used its time well or badly.
       22. Thus, there is no gap in the life of the spirit in spite of
the forgetfulness of the past. The spirit is always itself before, during
and after incarnation; incarnation is but one special phase of its
existence. Such forgetfulness occurs only during the outward life of
relationships, however. During sleep, while it is partially disengaged
from its corporeal ties and restored to freedom and the spirit life,
the spirit remembers; its spirit sight is not so obscured by matter.


                                   221

                          Genesis - Chapter XI


       23. Taking humankind at its lowest degree of the intellectual
scale, such as the least evolved humans, one questions if that is the
starting point for the human soul.
       According to the opinion of certain spiritualist
philosophers, the intelligent principle, distinct from the material
principle, individualizes and develops by passing through
the many degrees of animality. This is the time when the soul
rehearses for life and develops its first skills through practice.
One might say that this is its incubation period. Having arrived
at the degree of development that the human state requires, it
receives the special characteristics that comprise the human soul.
Hence, there would be a spiritual filiation from animal to human
being, just as there is a corporeal filiation.
       Founded on the great law of unity that presides over creation,
one must agree that this theory is in keeping with the justice and
goodness of the Creator. It gives a reason, an objective and a destiny
to animals, which are no longer disinherited beings, but which find
in the future reserved for them a compensation for their sufferings.
What constitutes the spiritual human being is not its origin, but
the special attributes it is endowed with upon entering humanity,
attributes that transform it and make it into a distinct being, just as
the tasty fruit is distinct from the bitter root that produced it. By
having passed through the lineage of animality, the human being
would not be any less human; it would not be any more an animal
than the fruit is the root, just as a learned person is not the shapeless
fetus through which he or she debuted in the world.
       However, this theory leads to numerous issues, whose pros
and cons are not amenable to discussion at the moment, nor would
it be appropriate to examine the different theories that have been
formulated on the matter. Hence, without searching for the soul’s
origin and the channels through which it might have passed, we
shall take as its entrance into humanity the point at which, endowed


                                  222

                          The Spiritual Genesis


with moral sense and free will, it begins to bear responsibility for
its own actions.
       24. The incarnate spirit’s obligation to provide for the
sustenance of its body, its safety and well-being constrains it
to apply its faculties in the search to exercise and develop such
faculties. Thus, its union with matter is useful for its evolution
and that is why incarnation is a necessity. Furthermore, by means
of the intelligent labor that it performs upon matter to its own
advantage, it concurs in the physical transformation and progress
of the globe that it inhabits. Its laboring for its own progress is how
it contributes to the Creator’s work as an unsuspecting agent.
       25. The spirit’s incarnation, however, is neither constant
nor perpetual; it is only transitory. Upon leaving one body behind,
it does not take another immediately. During a shorter or longer
length of time, it lives the spirit life, which is its normal life. Hence,
the amount of time spent during its different incarnations is very
small compared with the time it spends in the state of a free spirit.
       During the interval between its incarnations, the spirit
also progresses in the sense that it uses for its advancement the
knowledge and experience it acquired during its corporeal life. It
examines what it did during its earthly stay, reviews what it learned,
recognizes its wrongs, draws up its plans and makes resolutions by
which it hopes to be guided in a new existence as it tries to do
better. It is in this way that each life is a step forward on the path
of progress, a sort of a practical schooling.
      26. Incarnation is therefore not normally a punishment
for the spirit, as some might think, but a condition inherent to
the unevolved state of the spirit and a means of progressing. (See
Heaven and Hell, chap. III, nos. 8 ff.)
      As the spirit progresses morally, it dematerializes; that is,
by freeing itself from the influence of matter, it purifies itself. Its


                                   223

                          Genesis - Chapter XI


life becomes more spiritualized and its abilities and perceptions
broaden; its happiness is a result of the progress it has accomplished.
However, since it acts in virtue of its free will, it can, through
negligence or ill will, delay its advancement. Consequently, it
prolongs the duration of its material incarnations, which then
become a punishment, since due to its own fault it remains in the
lower ranks and must start the same task all over again. It thus
depends on the spirit itself to shorten – through its own efforts at
self-purification – the extent of the period of incarnations.
       27. The physical progress of a planet accompanies the
moral progress of its inhabitants. Now, since the creation of worlds
and spirits is incessant, and since the latter progress quickly or
slowly by virtue of their free will, it follows that there are both
newer and older worlds at different degrees of physical and moral
advancement; worlds where incarnation is more material or less
so, and where, consequently, the labor for spirits is also harsher
or less harsh. From this point of view, earth is one of the least
advanced. Because it is populated with relatively low ordered
spirits, corporeal life is harder than on other worlds, just as there
are less-evolved worlds where life is even harder than on the earth,
and for whom the earth would be a relatively happy world.
       28. When, on one world, spirits have accomplished the
amount of progress that the state of that world makes possible,
they leave it in order to incarnate on another that is more advanced,
where they acquire new knowledge; this process continues until
incarnation in physical bodies is no longer useful, and they live
the spirit life exclusively, where they progress in yet another sense
and through other means. When they arrive at the culminating
point of progress, they enjoy supreme bliss. Admitted into the
counsels of the Almighty, they have God’s thought and become
God’s messengers and direct ministers in the government of


                                  224

                          The Spiritual Genesis


worlds, having under their orders other spirits at different degrees
of advancement.
       Hence, all spirits, incarnate or discarnate, at whatever degree
they may find themselves in the spirit hierarchy, from the lowest
to the highest, have their functions in the grand mechanism of
the universe. All are useful to the whole while at the same time
useful to themselves; the least advanced, as happens with unskilled
underlings, are charged with material tasks, at first unconsciously
and then gradually more aware. There is activity everywhere in the
spirit world; nowhere is there useless idleness.
       The collectivity of spirits is, in a way, the soul of the universe.
It is the spiritual element that acts in everything and everywhere
under the impulse of the divine thought. Without this element
there is only inert matter, without purpose, without intelligence,
and without any other driving power than the physical forces that
leave a multitude of unsolvable problems. Through the action of
the individualized spiritual element, everything has a purpose, a
reason for being; everything is explained. This is why, without
spirituality, one runs into insurmountable difficulties.
       29. When the earth possessed the climactic conditions
appropriate for the existence of the human species, human spirits
began to incarnate on it. Where did they come from? Whether they
were created at that moment, or whether they came completely
formed from the earth, space or other worlds, their presence after
a certain time is a fact, because before their arrival there were only
animals. They clothed themselves in bodies that were appropriate
for their special needs and aptitudes, and which physiologically
belonged to animality. Under their influence and by the exercising
of their faculties, these bodies changed and improved – this is
what results from observation. Thus, let us set aside the issue
of origin as being unsolvable for the time being; let us consider
the spirit, not at its point of departure, but at the point in which

                                   225

                                     Genesis - Chapter XI


the first seeds of free will and moral sense start to manifest in it:
we see it performing its human-related role, without troubling
ourselves with the environment where it had spent the period of
its infancy, or, if one prefers, its incubation. Despite the similarity
of its envelope to that of the animals, by the intellectual and moral
faculties that characterize it, we are able to distinguish the human
spirit from the latter, just as beneath the same woolen garments we
may distinguish the uncouth from the refined person.
        30. Although the first humans to arrive must have been
little-advanced, and for that very reason had to incarnate in highly
imperfect bodies, they must have had among them perceivable
differences in their characteristics and aptitudes. Kindred spirits
naturally grouped together due to similarity and affinity. The
earth was thus populated with diverse categories of spirits who
varied in their desire either to progress or to rebel against progress.
Their bodies received the imprint of their spirit’s character, and
procreating according to their respective types, the result was races
that differed both physically and morally (see no. 11)98 Similar
spirits continued to incarnate, preferably amongst those who were
similar to them, thereby perpetuating the distinctive physical and
moral characteristics of the various races and their peoples. Such
characteristics are lost only over long periods of time through
interbreeding and the progress of the spirits. (See Revue Spirite,
Jul. 1860, p. 198: Phrénologie et physiognomonie)
       31. The spirits who came to populate the earth may be
compared to those multitudes of immigrants of various origins
who go to settle in a virgin land. There they find wood and stone
to build their dwellings, and individuals give theirs their own
different style, according to the degree of their own knowledge
and particular flair. There, they form groups based on similarity of

                                             226

                          The Spiritual Genesis


origin and taste, and these groups end up forming tribes and then
whole nations with their own customs and character.
       32. Therefore, progress has not been uniform throughout
the human species. The more intelligent races naturally surpassed
the others, aside from the fact that, upon coming to incarnate on
the earth after the arrival of the first ones, spirits newly-born to
the spirit life rendered the differences in progress more noticeable.
In fact, it would be impossible to attribute the same antiquity of
creation to the primitives barely distinguishable from the apes, to
the Chinese, for example, and even less to civilized Europeans.
       Nevertheless, the spirits of primitives also belong to
humankind; someday they will reach the level of their elders, but
this certainly will not occur in bodies of the same physical race, bodies
unsuited to a certain degree of moral and intellectual development.
When the instrument is no longer on par with their development,
they will emigrate from such surroundings to incarnate on a
higher level, and so on and so forth until they have surmounted all
earthly levels, at which point they will leave the earth behind to go
on to other more and more advanced worlds.

                         Reincarnation
       33. The principle of reincarnation is a necessary
consequence of the law of progress. Without reincarnation, how
can one explain the difference between the present societal state
and that of the times of barbarism? If souls are created at the same
time as the body, those being born today are as new and primitive
as those who lived a thousand years ago. Adding the fact that there
would be no connection or necessary relationship between the two
groups and that they would be completely independent of each
other, why then are souls today better endowed by God than those


                                  227

                         Genesis - Chapter XI


of their predecessors? Why do they possess greater understanding?
Why do they possess finer instincts and gentler customs? Why
do they have an intuition about certain matters without having
learned them? This dilemma is a challenge to solve if we are led
to believe that God creates souls of different qualities according
to times and places, a proposition irreconcilable with the idea of
supreme justice. (See chap. II, no. 19)
       On the contrary, if we say that the souls of today have already
lived in far-off times; that they could have been barbaric in barbaric
times, but have since progressed; that for each new existence they
bring with them what they acquired in previous lives; and that,
consequently, the souls of civilized times are not souls created
more perfect, but rather, souls that have been perfecting themselves
over time, then you will have the only plausible explanation for the
cause of social progress. (See The Spirits’ Book, chaps. IV and V).
       34. Some persons believe that the soul’s various existences
are accomplished by going from world to world, and not on one
and the same globe, where each spirit would appear only once.
       This doctrine would be acceptable if all earth’s inhabitants
were at the same intellectual and moral level. In that case, they
could not progress except by going from one world to another, and
their reincarnation on earth would be pointless. God, however,
does nothing pointless. On earth we find all degrees of intelligence
and morality, from primitivism bordering on animality to the
most advanced civilization; hence it offers a vast field for progress.
It would bear asking why primitives would be obligated to seek
the next evolutionary level elsewhere when it and successive levels
lie right next them where they now are; why advanced humans
could take their first steps only on less evolved worlds when beings
analogous to all such worlds are all around them; and why there
are different degrees of advancement, not only from culture to
culture, but within the same culture and the same family. If such

                                 228

                          The Spiritual Genesis


were the case, God would have done something useless in placing
ignorance and wisdom, barbarism and civilization, good and evil
side by side, when in reality it is precisely such contact that enables
stragglers to progress.
       There is therefore no more need for humans to change worlds
at each step than there is for a student to change schools at each grade.
Far from being an advantage for progress it would be a hindrance,
because the spirit would be deprived of the example of seeing the
higher degrees, and of the possibility of correcting its errors within
the same environment and in the presence of those whom it had
offended, a possibility that represents for it the most powerful means
of moral progress. After a short cohabitation, spirits would disperse
and become strangers to one another, and the bonds of family and
friendship, without time to consolidate, would be broken.
       Furthermore, to a moral unsuitability, a material unsuitability
would be added. The nature of the elements, the organic laws and
the conditions for life vary from world to world; in this regard,
there are no two that are perfectly identical. Our treatises on
physics, chemistry, anatomy, medicine, botany, etc. might be of
no use on other worlds. Whatever is learned on other worlds is
not lost, however; not only does it develop the intelligence, but
it also helps to develop ideas previously acquired on them. (See
chap. VI, nos. 61ff.). If the spirit made but one appearance –
often of brief duration – on the same world, at each migration
it would find itself in entirely different conditions. Each time,
it would operate on new elements with powers and according to
laws unfamiliar to it before having had time to work with known
elements, to study them, and to apply them. Each time, it would
be a new apprenticeship, and these incessant changes would be an
obstacle to progress. The spirit must therefore remain on the same
world until it has acquired the sum of knowledge and degree of
perfection that such world renders possible. (See no. 31)


                                  229

                                     Genesis - Chapter XI


      Thus it is and thus it must be that spirits depart for a more
advanced world, leaving behind the old one on which there is
nothing else to acquire – such is the principle. If there are some
who leave before that time, it is obviously due to individual causes
that God has weighed in the divine wisdom.
      Everything in creation has an objective, without which God
would neither be prudent nor wise. Besides, if the earth were only
one stage in the progress of each individual, what use would it be
for children who die at a very young age to come here to spend
a few years, months or hours, during which they could acquire
nothing? The same applies to the mentally impaired. A theory is
no good unless it can resolve all issues connected with it. The issue
of premature deaths has been a stumbling block for all doctrines
except the Spiritist Doctrine, the only one that has resolved it
rationally and completely.
      For those who, for their progress, complete a normal lifespan
on the earth, there is a real advantage in finding themselves in
the same environment in order to continue what they had left
unfinished. They often return to the same family or encounter
the same persons in order either to make up for the evil they have
done or to suffer the law of talion.99

       Emigrations and Immigrations of Spirits
        35. During the intervals between their corporeal existences,
spirits are in the errant state and comprise the ambient spirit population
of the globe. Through death and birth, the two populations incessantly

     Lex Talionis is latin for Law of Retaliation. This concept is derived from the Mosaic law “an
     eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth”, which is a variation of the original concept promulgated

     Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lex_Talionis_

                                                230

                        The Spiritual Genesis


circulate from one to the other. Hence, there are daily emigrations
from the corporeal to the spirit world and immigrations from the
spirit world to the corporeal: these are normal daily happenings.
       36. At certain times determined by the divine wisdom,
various degrees of mass emigrations and immigrations occur as
a result of a great turmoil that causes enormous numbers to exit
at the same time, to be soon replaced by equivalent numbers of
incarnations. Therefore, one must regard destructive calamities
and cataclysms as occasions for collective arrivals and departures,
the providential means for renewing the globe’s corporeal
population and for reinvigorating it by introducing newer more
purified spirit members. If in such catastrophes a large number of
bodies are destroyed, they should be viewed as nothing more than
torn garments, since not one spirit perishes. They simply switch
environments. Instead of departing individually, they depart en
masse – that is all the difference – whether they depart by one
cause or another, they would depart sooner or later nonetheless.
       The rapid, nearly instantaneous renewals that occur in
the spirit element of the population as a result of destructive
calamities speed up social progress. Without the emigrations and
immigrations that occur from time to time in order to give society
a strong boost, it would progress extremely slowly.
       It is remarkable that all the great calamities that decimate
populations are always followed by an era of progress in the
physical, intellectual and moral orders, and, consequently, in the
societal state of the nations where they take place. The purpose of
such calamities therefore is to cause a reorganization in the spirit
population, which is the normal and active population of the globe.
      37. This transfusion that occurs among the incarnate and
discarnate populations of the same globe also occurs among the
many worlds, whether individually under normal conditions, or


                                231

                          Genesis - Chapter XI


en masse under special circumstances. Hence, there are collective
emigrations and immigrations from one world to another. This
results in introducing entirely new members into the population
of a globe. New races of spirits come to mix in with present ones,
thereby forming new races of humans. Now, since spirits never lose
what they have acquired, they bring with them their intelligence
and the intuition of the knowledge they possess. Consequently, they
imprint their particular character on the corporeal race they have
come to animate. For this, they do not need new bodies to be created
specially for their use; since the corporeal species already exists, they
find bodies fully ready to receive them. They are therefore simply
new inhabitants. In coming to the earth, they at first compose part
of its spirit population, and later they incarnate like the rest.

                      The Adamic Race
       38. According to the teaching of the Spirits, it was one of
these great immigrations, or rather, one of these spirit colonies that
came from another globe and gave rise to the race symbolized in the
person of Adam, and for this reason is called the Adamic race. When
it arrived here, the earth had already been populated since time
immemorial, much like the Americas when the Europeans arrived.
       The Adamic race was more advanced than those that had
preceded it on the earth and was, in effect, more intelligent; it was
the one that drove all the others to progress. The book of Genesis
shows us that it was industrious from the start, that is was skillful
in the arts and sciences without having passed through intellectual
infancy, which is not characteristic of primitive races, but which
does agree with the notion that it was composed of spirits who had
already progressed. Everything indicates that the Adamic race is
not very old on the earth, and nothing opposes it having been here
for only a few thousand years; hence, the idea contradicts neither


                                  232

                         The Spiritual Genesis


geological facts nor anthropological observations, which, quite to
the contrary, tend to confirm it.
       39. The doctrine according to which the entire human species
came from one sole individual six thousand years ago is no longer
acceptable according to the current state of our knowledge. Taken
from the physical and moral order of things, the main considerations
that contradict this assertion may be summed up as follows:
       From the physiological point of view, certain races display
characteristically particular types, a fact that prevents assigning
them to a common origin. There are differences that are obviously
not simple effects of the climate, since Whites who reproduce in
countries predominated by Blacks do not become Blacks, and
vice versa. The strength of the sun rays tans and darkens the skin,
but it has never transformed a White into a Black, changed the
characteristics of the face, or changed straight hair into afro-type
hair. Today we know that black skin color comes from a particular
subcutaneous tissue distinctive of that species.
       Therefore, one must regard the Black, Mongolian and
White races as having their own origins and as having come into
being simultaneously or successively in different parts of the globe;
their interbreeding has given rise to secondary mixed races. The
physiological characteristics of the primitive races are obvious
indications that they came from special types. Consequently, the
same considerations apply both to humans and animals regarding
the plurality of their lineage. (See chap. X, nos. 2 ff.)
      40. Adam and his descendants are presented in Genesis as
essentially intelligent people, who from their second generation
build cities, cultivate the land and work with metals. Their
progress in the arts and sciences is rapid and sustained. Thus, it is
inconceivable that this lineage would have had as its descendants
numerous peoples so backward and of an intelligence so rudimentary


                                 233

                                     Genesis - Chapter XI


that it approached animality, and who would have lost all traits and
all remembrance of what their ancestors accomplished. A difference
this radical in intellectual aptitudes and moral development attests
no less clearly to a difference in origin.
       41. Regardless of the geological facts, proof of the existence
of human beings on the earth before the time set by Genesis may
be gleaned from the population of the globe.
       Without mentioning Chinese chronology, which is said to go
back some thirty thousand years, authentic documentation shows
that Egypt, India and other lands were populated and flourishing
at least three thousand years before the Christian era, that is, one
thousand years after the creation of the first man according to
the biblical chronology. Recent documentation and observation
leave no doubt nowadays as to the relations that existed between
the Americas and the ancient Egyptians, from which one must
conclude that that land mass was already populated at the time.
It would thus be necessary to believe that, in one thousand years,
the descendants of only one individual could cover the largest part
of the earth. The reality is, such profusion would be completely
contrary to all anthropological laws.100
      42. The impossibility becomes even more obvious if one
accepts the Genesis account that the flood destroyed the entire
human species – except for Noah and his family – which could not

      The 1867 World’s Fair displayed antiquities from Mexico that left no doubt as to the
      connections the peoples of this country had with the ancient Egyptians. On a placard
      affixed to the Mexican temple at the Fair, Mr. Leon Mechedin stated:
      “From the human history point of view, it is not proper to prematurely publish discoveries
      made by the recent scientific expedition to Mexico. Nonetheless, nothing should keep
      the public from knowing nowadays that that exploration has pointed to the existence of
      a large number of cities that disappeared over time, but which the pick and fire can draw
      from their burial shroud. In all, the excavations uncovered three layers of civilizations,
      which seem to give the American world a remarkable ancientness.” This is how science
      belies daily the claims of the doctrine that limits to 6,000 years the appearance of
      humankind on the earth and claims that it derives from one single founder. – Auth.

have been very numerous in the 1,656th year of the world, that
is, 2,348 years before the Christian era. Therefore, in reality, the
date for the peopling of the earth would have started with Noah;
however, when the Hebrews settled in Egypt 612 years after the
flood, that country – not to mention others – was already a powerful
empire that would have had to have been populated in less than six
centuries by Noah’s sole descendants, which is inadmissible.
       Let us note in passing that the Egyptians welcomed the
Hebrews as foreigners. It would be surprising that they had lost
all recollection of a commonality of origin so close while they
religiously preserved the monuments of their history.
       A strict logic, corroborated by the facts, demonstrates
peremptorily that humankind has been on the earth for an
indeterminate amount of time, well before the time assigned
by Genesis. The same applies to the diversity of the primitive
lineages, because, demonstrating the impossibility of a proposition
is to demonstrate the opposite proposition. If Geology were to
discover authentic traces of human presence before the great
diluvial period, the demonstration would be even more complete.

matter and morally through the purification of the spirits who

101
      In the Jan. 1862 issue of Revue Spirite, when we published an article on the interpretation
      of the doctrine of the fallen angels, we presented this theory as a hypothesis, with no other
      authority than that of a debatable personal opinion, because, at the time, we lacked
      elements sufficiently complete for an absolute assertion. We put it out as a trial essay,
      seeking to elicit examination of the issue, fully determined to abandon it or modify it if
      need be. Today, however, this theory has endured the test of universal control. It has not
      only been accepted by the majority of Spiritists as the most rational and most in agreement
      with God’s justice, but has also been confirmed by most of the instructions given by the
      Spirits on the subject. The same applies to the origin of the Adamic race. – Auth.



                                                235

                          Genesis - Chapter XI


inhabit them. Happiness on them is due to the predominance of
good over evil, and the predominance of the good is the result of
the moral advancement of the spirits. Intellectual progress is not
enough, however, because intelligence can be used for evil.
       Thus, as soon as a world reaches one of its periods of
transformation – necessary to enable it to ascend hierarchically –
mutations occur within its incarnate and discarnate population.
This is when the large emigrations and immigrations take place
(see no. 34, 35). Those who, in spite of their intelligence and
knowledge, persevere in evil – in their rebellion against God and
God’s laws – would henceforth be a hindrance to subsequent
moral progress and a permanent cause of problems contrary to
the happiness and peacefulness of the good ones. That is why they
are excluded and sent to less advanced worlds; there they will use
their intelligence and intuition of previously acquired knowledge
for the progress of those among whom they have been called to
live. At the same time, by means of a series of pain-filled existences
and arduous labor, they will expiate their past wrongs and the
intentional hardening of their hearts.
       What could they be among such new (from their point of
view) peoples that are still in the infancy of barbarism but fallen
angels or spirits sent in expiation? The world from which they were
expelled, would it not be for them a paradise lost? Would it not be for
them a place of delight in comparison with the harsh environment
to which they have been relegated for thousands of centuries until
the day when they will have deserved their deliverance? Their
vague, intuitive memory of that world is like a distant mirage that
reminds them of what they lost due to their own fault.
      44. However, at the same time that evil spirits depart the
world they used to inhabit, they are replaced by better spirits, perhaps
coming from a world less advanced that they have merited leaving
behind, and for whom the new habitation is a reward. Because the

                                  236

                          The Spiritual Genesis


spirit population has been renewed and purged of its worst members,
after some time the moral state of that world is improved.
        Such changes are sometimes partial, that is, limited to one
culture or race. At other times, they are widespread, when the
period for renewal for the entire globe has come.
       45. The Adamic race displays all the characteristics of a
proscribed race. The spirits that comprised it were exiled to the
earth, which was already populated, but with primitive human
beings immersed in ignorance. They had the mission of enabling
them to progress by bringing amongst them the light of a
developed intelligence. Is this not actually the role that this race
has played until today? Its intellectual superiority shows that the
world it left behind was more advanced than the earth. However,
this world had to enter a new phase of progress, and due to their
own obstinacy, these spirits were not up to this task. They would
have been out of place and would have become an obstacle to the
providential headway of things. Consequently, they were expelled,
while others more deserving began to replace them.
       In relegating that race to this earth of labor and suffering, God
had reason to tell them, “You shall gather your nourishment with the
sweat of your brow.” However, out of divine mercy God promised to
send them a Savior, that is, one who would shine a light on the path
they were to follow so that they could leave this place of misery, this
hell, and attain to the bliss of the elect. God sent this Savior in the
person of Christ, who taught the law of love and charity unknown to
them, and which would be their true anchor of salvation.
       It is with the same objective of enabling humankind to
advance in a determined sense that high order spirits – although
without Christ’s qualities – incarnate from time to time on the
earth to carry out special missions that simultaneously result in
their own personal advancement if they fulfill them according to
the objectives of the Creator.

                                  237

                         Genesis - Chapter XI


       46. Without reincarnation, God’s promise and Christ’s
mission would have been senseless. Let us suppose that the soul of
each human being is actually created at the birth of its body and that
it does nothing except to appear and then disappear from the earth
for good. There would be no relationship between those who came
between Adam and Christ, nor between those who have come since
Christ; they would all be strangers to one another. God’s promise of
a Savior would not apply to Adam’s descendants if their souls had
not yet been created. So that Christ’s mission could correspond to
God’s words, it would be necessary for it to apply to the same souls.
If such souls are new, however, they could not be stained by the
wrong of the first father, who is a carnal father and not a spiritual
one. Otherwise, God would have created souls stained by a wrong
that could not apply to them because they did not yet exist at the
time. The common doctrine of original sin consequently implies
the need for a link between the souls of Christ’s time and those of
Adam’s; it implies, therefore, reincarnation.
       If you state instead that all those souls made up a part of the
colony of spirits exiled on earth at the time of Adam and that they
were stained with vices that had caused them to be excluded from a
better world, then you will have the only reasonable interpretation
of original sin, a sin that is proper to each individual and not the
result of his or her responsibility for the wrong of another whom
he or she has never known. If you say that those souls or spirits
are reborn many times on the earth to live corporeally in order to
progress and purify themselves, and that Christ came to enlighten
those same souls not only about their past lives but also about their
subsequent ones, then you will give his mission a real and serious
objective acceptable to reason.
     47. A familiar example, striking by its similarity, will

                          The Spiritual Genesis


        On May 24, 1861, the frigate Iphigenia transported a
disciplinary company of 291 men to New Caledonia. When they
arrived, the commander of the colony gave them an order for the
day, as follows:
        “When you set your feet upon this far-off land, you will
have already understood the role reserved for you.
        “At the example of the brave sailors of our navy serving in
your presence, you will help us bring with distinction the banner
of civilization into the midst of the primitive tribes of New
Caledonia. Is this not a fine and noble mission, I ask you? You
shall fulfill it worthily.
        “Listen to the voice and advice of your superiors. I am their
commander; may my words be well understood.
        “The choice of your commander, your officers, your
subordinates and corporals is a sure guarantee for all efforts that
will be made to render you excellent soldiers, and, I might add, to
elevate you to the stature of good citizens and transform you into
honored colonists if you so desire.
        “Your discipline will be harsh and so it must be. In our hands you
can be sure it will be firm and unbending, but also just and paternal.
It will know how to discern error from vice and degradation…”
        Here we have men who because of bad conduct have been
expelled from a civilized country and sent to a barbaric culture as
punishment. What did their leader tell them? “You broke the laws
of your own country. You were cause for trouble and scandal and
you were expelled. They sent you here, but here you can redeem
your past. Through labor, you will be able to create an honorable
position and become honest citizens. You have a fine mission to
fulfill: bringing civilization to these wild tribes. The discipline will
be harsh but just, and we will know how to discern those who
proceed well. Your fate is in your own hands; you can improve it if
you so desire, because you have free will.”


                                   239

                           Genesis - Chapter XI


       For those men relegated to the midst of the wild, was their
motherland not a paradise lost because of their wrongs and their
rebellion against the law? In that far-off land were they not fallen angels?
Was not the language of their leader that which God used in addressing
the spirits exiled on earth: “You disobeyed my laws and for that you
were expelled from the world where you could have lived happily and
peacefully. Here, you shall be condemned to labor; however, through
good behavior you will merit pardon and regain the homeland you lost
because of your own fault, that is, the heaven you have lost?”
       48. At first sight, the notion of a fall seems to contradict the
principle that spirits cannot regress. However, one must consider
that it is not the case of a return to the primitive state. The spirit,
notwithstanding its lower position, loses nothing of what it has
acquired. Its moral and intellectual development remains the
same, whatever may be the environment into which is has been
placed. It is in the situation of the man and woman of the world
condemned to prison for their crimes; certainly, they are disgraced
and fallen from a societal point of view, but they become neither
more stupid nor more ignorant.
      49. Would we believe that those men sent to New Caledonia
are suddenly going to become models of virtue? Are they going to
suddenly be absolved of their past errors? One would have to not
know humanity to believe so. For the same reason, the spirits of
the Adamic race, once transplanted in the land of exile, did not
instantly shed their pride and their evil instincts. For a long time
they retained the tendencies they brought with them, a vestige of
the old yeast – now, is this not original sin?

                                The Six Days102
       1. CHAPTER I 1 In the beginning, God created heaven and
the earth 2 The earth was uniform and entirely barren; darkness
covered the face of the deep and the Spirit of God hovered over the
waters. 3 And God said: Let light be made, and light was made. 4
God saw that the light was good and he separated the light from the
darkness. 5 He gave to the light the name day and to the darkness
the name night; and evening and morning made the first day.
       6
         God also said: Let the firmament be made in the midst of
the waters, and let it separate waters from waters. 7 And God made
the firmament; and he separated the waters that were beneath the
firmament from those that were above the firmament. And thus
it was. 8 And God gave to the firmament the name heaven; and
evening and morning made the second day.
       9
         God said further: Let the waters that are under heaven
be gathered into only one place, and let the dry element appear.
And thus it was. 10 God gave to the dry element the name land
and he called all the gathered waters ocean. And he saw that this

was good. 11 God said further: Let the land produce green plants
that bear seed, and fruit trees that bear fruit, each according to its
species, and let them contain their seeds within them in order to
reproduce on the earth. And so it was. 12 The earth thus produced
green plants that bore their seed according to their species, and fruit
trees that contained their seeds within them, each one according
to its species. And God saw that it was good. 13 And evening and
morning made the third day.
       14
          God also said: Let bodies of light be made in the
firmament of heaven in order to separate the day from the night,
and let them serve as signs to mark the time and the seasons,
the days and the years. 15 Let them shine in the firmament of
heaven and illumine the earth. And thus it was done. 16 God
then made two great luminous bodies, one larger to preside over
the day, and the other smaller to preside over the night; he also
made the stars. 17 And he put them in the firmament of heaven
to shine upon the earth. 18 It was thus done so that they would
preside over the day and the night and to separate the light from
the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And evening and
morning made the fourth day.
       20
          And God said further: Let the waters produce living
animals that swim in the water and birds that fly over the earth
and beneath the firmament of heaven. 21 God thus created the
great fishes and all the animals that have life and movement, which
the waters produced, each one according to its species, and he also
created all the birds according to their species. And he saw that
it was good. 22 He blessed them, saying: Grow and multiply, and
occupy the waters of the ocean; and let the birds multiply over the
earth. 23 And evening and morning made the fifth day.
       24
          God also said: Let the earth produce living animals, each
one according to its species: domestic animals, reptiles and wild
beasts of the earth in their different kind. And so it was. 25 Thus,


                                 242

                         The Mosaic Genesis


God made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, the
domestic animals and all the reptiles, each according to its kind.
And God saw that it was good.
       26
          Next he said: Let us make man in our image and likeness,
and let him rule over the fishes in the ocean, the birds in the sky,
the beasts upon all the earth and over all the reptiles that move
upon the earth. 27 Thus, God created man in his image and he
created them in the image of God, and he created them male
and female. 28 God blessed them and said to them: Grow and
multiply, occupy the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish
in the ocean, over the birds in the sky and over all the animals
that move upon the earth. Furthermore, God said: I give to you
all the plants that bear their seed upon the earth and all the trees
that carry their seeds within them, each one according to its kind,
so that they may serve as your food; 30 And to all the animals of
the earth, all the birds in the sky and everything that moves upon
the earth, and which are alive and animated so that they may be
fed. And thus it was done. 31 God saw all the things he had made;
and that they were all very good. 23 And evening and morning
made the sixth day.
       CHAPTER II. 1 Heaven and earth were thus finished with
all their ornaments. 2 On the seventh day, God finished all the
work that he had made, and he rested on the seventh day after
having finished all his work. 3 He blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it, because on this day he ceased producing all the works
that he had created. 4 Such is the origin of heaven and earth, and
thus they were created on the day that the Lord made each one. 5
And thus he created all the plants of the fields before they came
out of the earth and all the grass of the plains before they grew,
because the Lord God had not yet made it rain upon the earth and
there were no men to work it. But a spring rose from the ground
which watered the whole surface.

                        Genesis - Chapter XII


      7
        Then the Lord God formed man from the clay of the earth
and he spread over their face a breath of life, and man became
living and animated.
       2. Following the explanations contained in the preceding
chapters on the origin and constitution of the universe, according
to the data furnished by science for the physical part and according
to Spiritism for the spiritual aspect, it would be useful to place
them in parallel with the Genesis text of Moses so that everyone
can make a comparison and judge knowingly. A few supplementary
explanations will suffice to make comprehensible the parts that
require special clarification.
       3. On certain points there is certainly a noteworthy
agreement between the Mosaic Genesis and scientific doctrine;
however, it would be erroneous to believe that it would be enough
simply to replace the six twenty-four hour days of creation with
six indeterminate periods in order to find a complete similarity.
It would be a no less great mistake to believe that, apart from
the allegorical meaning of some of the words, Genesis and science
walk side by side, as if one were only a paraphrase of the other.
       4. Let us note from the start that, as we have stated (chap.
VII, no. 14), the number of six geological periods is arbitrary,
since more than twenty-five well characterized formations may be
counted. This number merely marks out the large general phases;
it was adopted in the beginning only to match the biblical text as
much as possible regarding a time not too long ago when it was
believed that science was to be verified by the Bible. This is why
that, in order to be more readily accepted, the authors of most
cosmogonical theories endeavored to make science harmonize
with the sacred text. Once supported by the experimental method,
science felt stronger and became emancipated; today, it is the Bible
that is to be verified by science.

                         The Mosaic Genesis


      Moreover, in taking as its starting point the formation of
the granitic layers, geology does not include in its periods the
primitive state of the earth. It is no longer concerned with the
sun, the moon, the stars or the universe as a whole, which belongs
to astronomy. In order to enter the framework of Genesis, one
would thus have to add a primary period embracing this order of
phenomena, and which could be called the astronomical period.
      Moreover, the diluvial period is not considered by all
geologists as forming a distinct period, but as a transitory and
temporary event that did not change the globe’s climactic state
notably or mark a new phase for plant and animal species, since,
with few exceptions, the same species are to be found both before
and after the flood. Thus, we can set aside that period without
compromising the truth.
       5. The following comparative table, in which the
phenomena that characterized each of the six periods are summed
up, allows us to embrace the whole and judge the relationships and
differences between them and the biblical Genesis.

       6. An initial fact that stands out from the comparative table
above is that the work of each of the six days does not correspond
as strictly as many believe to each of the six geological periods.
The most noticeable concordance is that of the sequence of
organic beings, which is approximately the same, and that of the
appearance of humankind last. Now, this is an important fact.
       There is also coincidence, not as to the numeric order of
the periods, but as to the fact per se in the passage where it is
stated that, on the third day, “the waters that are under heaven
be gathered into only one place, and let the dry element appear.”
This is the expression of what occurred in the tertiary period,
when the upheavals of the solid crust caused the uncovering
of the continents and the waters to recede to form the oceans.
It was only then that land animals appeared according to both
geology and Moses.
      7. When Moses said that creation took six days, did he mean
24-hour days or did he understand this word to mean a period
or span of time? The first hypothesis is most likely if one refers

                                247

                         Genesis - Chapter XII


to the text itself; foremost because such is the proper meaning of
the Hebrew word ïôm, translated as day; then, the specification of
evening and morning, which limit each of the six days, supports the
assumption that he meant ordinary days. There can be no doubt in
this respect when he states in verse 5: “He gave to the light the name
day and to the darkness the name night; and evening and morning
made the first day.” Obviously, this can apply only to a 24-hour day
divided by light and darkness. The meaning is even more precise
when he states in verse 17, speaking of the sun, moon and stars, “He
put them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth, to
preside over the day and the night and to separate the light from the
darkness. And evening and morning made the fourth day.”
       Moreover, everything in creation was miraculous, and
within the context of miracles, people could easily believe that the
earth was made in six 24-hour days, especially when the primary
natural laws were unknown. This belief was shared by all civilized
peoples up to the time in which geology appeared, facts in hand,
demonstrating its impossibility.
       8. One of the points most criticized in Genesis has been
the creation of the sun after the light. Attempts have been made
to explain this with data furnished by geology itself, stating that
in the early times of its formation, the earth’s atmosphere was
loaded with dense and opaque vapors and did not allow the sun
to be seen, thereby concluding that it did not exist as far as the
earth was concerned. This reasoning perhaps might be acceptable
if there had been inhabitants at that time to verify the presence or
absence of the sun; now, according to Moses himself, there were
only plants, which by all accounts, could not have grown and
multiplied without the action of the sun’s heat.
       Thus, there is obviously an anachronism in the order Moses
assigns for the creation of the sun; however, unintentionally or
not, he was not wrong in saying that the light preceded the sun.

                                 248

                         The Mosaic Genesis


       The sun is not the principle universal light, but a
concentration of luminous elements upon one spot, or to state
it another way, of the fluid that, in given circumstances, acquires
luminous properties. This fluid, which is the cause, must have
necessarily preceded the sun, which is only an effect. The sun is
cause with respect to the light it radiates, but it is an effect with
respect to what it received.
       In a dark room, one lit candle is a tiny sun. What is done
to light the candle? The illuminating property has developed from
the luminous fluid, and this fluid has become concentrated on one
spot. The candle is the cause of the light that shines throughout
the room, but if the luminous principle did not exist before the
candle, it could not have been lit in the first place.
       The same applies to the sun. The error comes from the long-
standing wrong idea that the entire universe began with the earth,
and it was not understood that the sun could have been created
after the light. It is now known that before our sun and earth,
millions of suns and earths existed, which consequently enjoyed
the light. Moses’ assertion, then, is perfectly exact in principle;
however, it is wrong in stating that the earth was created before
the sun. The earth is subject to the sun in its orbital movement, so
it must have been formed afterward; this is what Moses could not
have known, because he did not know about the law of gravity.
       The same thought may be found in the Genesis of the
ancient Persians. In the first chapter of the Avesta, Ahura Mazda,
narrating the world’s origin, states: “I created the light that was
to illumine the sun, the moon and the stars.” (Dictionnaire de
mythologie universelle.) The form here is certainly clearer and more
scientific than in Moses and needs no comment.
       9. Moses obviously shared the most primitive beliefs about
cosmology. Like everyone else at his time, he believed in the
solidity of the heavenly canopy and the upper repositories for the

                                249

                                         Genesis - Chapter XII


waters. This idea is expressed without allegory or ambiguity in this
passage (verses 6 ff.): “God said, ‘Let there be a firmament in the
midst of the waters to separate waters from waters. God made
the firmament and he separated the waters that were beneath the
firmament from those that were above the firmament.’” (See chap.
V, Ancient and modern theories about the world, nos. 3-5)
       According to one ancient belief, water was considered to be
the principle, the primitive generative element; therefore, Moses
was not speaking of the creation of the waters, which seemed to
exist already. “Darkness covered the deep,” means the depths of
space, which imagination vaguely portrayed as being occupied by
the waters and existing in darkness prior to the creation of the
light. That is why Moses says, “The Spirit of God hovered over the
waters.” Since the earth was supposedly formed in the midst of the
waters, it was necessary to isolate it; thus, it was believed that God
made the firmament, the solid canopy that separated the waters
above from those that were on the earth.
       In order to understand certain parts of Genesis, it is
indispensable to look at it from the point of view of the cosmological
ideas of the time of which it is the reflection.
      10. Due to the progress of physics and astronomy, such
a doctrine is not sustainable.103 Nevertheless, Moses attributed
these words to God himself; thus, since they express data that
is notoriously erroneous, one must consider: either God was
mistaken in the narrative about his work, or the narrative is not a
divine revelation after all. Since the first supposition is impossible,
one must conclude that Moses was expressing his own ideas. (See
chap. I, no. 3)


103
      As much as this belief is in error, it is no less a fact that it is still passed on to our children as
      a sacred truth. It is not without trembling that educators dare to risk a timid interpretation.

                                 The Mosaic Genesis


       11. Moses is more correct when he says that God formed
the man from the clay of the earth.104 In fact, Science shows us
(chap. X) that the human body is composed of elements taken
from inorganic matter, in other words, from the clay of the earth.
       The woman formed from one of Adam’s ribs is an allegory
that is obviously childish if taken literally, but is profound in
meaning. Its purpose is to show that woman is of the same nature as
man and is consequently his equal before God, and not a separate
creature to be enslaved and treated like a pariah. Made from his
very flesh, the image of equality is much more expressive than if
she had been formed separately from the same clay; it intends to
tell the man that she is his equal and not his slave, and that he
must love her as part of himself.
       12. For uneducated spirits who had no idea about general
laws, and who were incapable of comprehending the whole and
of conceiving of the infinite, this miraculous and instantaneous
creation had something fantastic about it that struck their
imagination. The picture of the universe taken from nothingness
in only a few days by a single act of the creative will was for such
spirits the most impressive sign of God’s power. What portrait of
such power could be more sublime and poetic than those words,
“God said, ‘Let there be light and there was light!’” Creating the
universe through the slow and gradual fulfillment of the laws
of nature, God would have seemed less great and less powerful.
Something extraordinary was necessary beyond ordinary ways;
otherwise, they would have said that God was no more skillful
than humans. A scientific and rational theory about creation
would have left them cold and indifferent.
       Therefore, we do not reject the biblical Genesis; on the
contrary, we study it as if we were studying the childhood history

of cultures. It is an epopee rich in allegories whose hidden meaning
must be searched for and which must be commented upon and
explained in the light of reason and science. Having highlighted
the poetic beauties and veiled teachings under the allegorical form,
it is necessary to honestly point out its errors in the interest of
religion itself. Religion will be more respected when such errors are
no longer imposed on faith as truths, and God will seem greater
and more powerful only when the divine name is not mixed with
controversial facts.

                                 Paradise Lost105
       13. CHAPTER II 9 The Lord God had planted a garden of
delights, in which he put the man that he had formed. – The Lord
God had also produced from the earth all kinds of trees beautiful
to look at and whose fruits were pleasing to the palate, and the
tree of life in the midst of this paradise106 along with the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil (Yahweh Elohim caused to come from
the earth (min haadama) every tree beautiful to look upon and good
for eating, and the tree of life (vehetz hachayim) in the midst of the
garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil).
       15
          Then the Lord took the man and placed him in the paradise
of delights in order for him to cultivate and tend it. 16 He also gave
him this order, and said to him, “You may eat from all the trees of
paradise (Yahweh Elohim ordered the man (hal haadam) by saying:
From every tree in the garden (hagan) you may eat). 17 But do not eat
the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for as soon as

                          The Mosaic Genesis


you eat from it you shall most certainly die. (And from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil (oumehetz hadaat tob vara) you will not
eat, for on the day on which you eat of it, you shall die).
        14. CHAPTER III 1 The serpent was the sliest of all the
animals that the Lord God had formed on the earth. It said to the
woman, “Why did God order you not to eat the fruit of all the
trees of paradise? (And the serpent (nâhâsch) was the most cunning
of all the land animals that Yahweh Elohim had made; it said to the
woman (el haïscha): Did Elohim say, “You shall not eat from any tree
in the garden?) – 2 The woman answered, “We may eat the fruit
of all the trees that are in paradise. (She, the woman, said to the
serpent, “The fruit (miperi) of the trees in the garden we may eat.) – 3
But as for the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of paradise, God
ordered us not to eat of it or touch it, for fear that we would be in
danger of dying. – 4 The serpent replied to the woman, “Certainly,
you will not die; – 5 But it is that God knows that as soon as you
have eaten of that fruit, your eyes will be opened and you will be
like gods, knowing good and evil.”
        6
          The woman then considered that the fruit of that tree would
be good to eat; that it was pleasant to look at. And having taken it,
she ate it and gave it to her husband to eat also. (She, the woman,
saw that the tree was good as food and that the tree was desirable for
UNDERSTANDING (leaskil), and she took of its fruit, etc.).
        8
          And because they heard the voice of the Lord God, who
was strolling in paradise after midday as a mild breeze was blowing,
they withdrew to the midst of the trees of paradise in order to hide
from his face.
        9
          Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where
are you?” – 10 Adam answered, “I heard your voice in paradise and
was afraid because I was naked; that is why I hid myself. – 11 The
Lord responded, “And how did you know that you were naked
unless it was because you ate the fruit of the tree from which I

                                  253

                         Genesis - Chapter XII


forbade you to eat?” – 12 Adam answered, “The woman whom you
gave me as a companion gave me the fruit of that tree and I ate
it.” – 13 The Lord God said to the woman, “Why did you do that?”
She responded, “The serpent deceived me and I ate of that fruit.”
        14
           Then, the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you
have done this, you are cursed among all the animals and all the
beasts of the earth; you shall crawl upon your belly and you shall
eat the earth all the days of your life. 15 I shall put enmity between
you and the woman, between her race and yours. She shall smash
your head and you shall try to bite her heel.”
        16
           God said to the woman also, “I shall afflict you with many
ills during your pregnancy; you shall give birth with pain; you shall be
under the domination of your husband and he shall dominate you.”
        17
           Next, he said to Adam, “Because you listened to the voice
of your wife and you ate of the fruit of the tree of which I forbade
you to eat, the earth shall be cursed because of what you have
done and only with much labor shall you take your food from it
throughout your whole life.
        18
           It shall produce thorns and briers and you shall eat the
plants of the earth. 19 And you shall eat your bread with the sweat
of your face until you return to the earth from which you were
taken, for you are dust and to dust you shall return.”
        20
           And Adam gave his wife the name Eve, which means life,
because she was the mother of all the living.
        21
           The Lord God also made for Adam and his wife garments
of skins with which they clothed themselves.
        22
           And he said, “Adam has become as one of us, knowing
good and evil. Therefore, let us prevent him from taking from
the tree of life, so that he does not take of its fruit also, and upon
eating that fruit, he shall live forever. (Yahweh Elohim said, “Thus,
the man has become as one of us for the knowledge of good and evil;
and now he can stretch out his hand and take from the tree of life

(veata pen ischlachyado velakach mehetz hachayim); he will eat
from it and live forever.)
      23
         The Lord God made him leave the garden of delights in
order to work at cultivating the earth from which he was taken.
      24
         And having expelled him, he placed cherubim107 in front
of the garden of delights; they made a flaming sword shimmer to
guard the way that led to the tree of life.
       15. Beneath a puerile and sometimes ridiculous imagery –
if we stop at the form – an allegory often hides the greatest truths.
At first sight, has there ever been a more absurd fable than that
of Saturn, a god devouring stones that he took as being his sons?
However, at the same time, there can be nothing more profoundly
philosophical and true than this figure if we search for its moral
meaning! Saturn is the personification of time; since all things
are the work of time, he is the father of everything that exists;
but everything is also destroyed with time. Saturn devouring the
stones is the symbol of destruction over time of the most lasting
objects – his sons – since they were formed with time. And who
escapes such destruction according to this same allegory? Jupiter,
the symbol of higher intelligence, of the spiritual principle, which
is indestructible. This image is so natural that, in modern language
and without allusion to this ancient fable, it is said of a thing that
has deteriorated over a stretch of time, that it has been devoured
by time, gnawed and ravaged by it.
       In reality, all pagan mythology is nothing more than a huge
allegorical picture of the various good and evil facets of humankind.
For whoever searches for the spirit in it, it is a complete course in
the highest philosophy, as is also the case with our modern fables.
Absurdity would be to take the form as being the substance.

        16. The same applies to Genesis, where it is necessary to
see great moral truths beneath material figures, which, if taken
literally, would be as absurd as if, regarding our own fables, we
were to take literally the scenes and dialogs attributed to animals.
        Adam is the personification of humankind; his wrong
individualizes the weakness of human beings, where the material
instincts that they are unable to resist predominate.108
        The tree – as in the tree of life – is the symbol of spiritual
life; like the tree of knowledge, it is the consciousness of good and
evil that humans acquire in order to develop their intelligence and
free will, and by means of which they choose between the two.
It signals the point at which the human soul ceases to be guided
solely by the instincts, takes possession of its freedom and incurs
responsibility for its acts.
        The fruit of the tree is the symbol of the material objects of
human desire; it is the allegory of greed and ambition; in a single
picture it sums up the reasons for the inducement to evil; eating it is
to yield temptation. It grows in the middle of the garden of delights
to show that seduction is at the center of pleasure and to remind us
that, if humans give preponderance to material pleasures, they are
kept bound to the earth and far from their spiritual destiny.109
        The death with which Adam is threatened if he transgresses
the prohibition is a warning of the inevitable physical and moral

108
      It is well known nowadays that the Hebrew word haadam is not a proper name, but
      means humans in general – humankind – which destroys any structure erected upon the
      personage of Adam – Auth.
109
      Nowhere in the text is the fruit specified as an apple; this word is to be found only in
      puerile versions. The term in the Hebrew text is peri, which has the same meanings as
      in French, without specifying the species, and could be taken in the material, moral or
      allegorical sense, both per se and figuratively. Among the Israelites there was no obligatory
      interpretation; when a word had many meanings, each person could understand it as he
      or she wished, provided that the interpretation was not contrary to proper grammar. The
      term peri was translated into Latin as malum, which could mean an apple or any other kind
      of fruit. It derives from the Greek melon, the participle of the verb melo: to interest, to take
      care of, to attract – Auth.



                                                  256

consequences resulting from violating the divine laws that God
has engraved on his conscience. It is quite obvious that the subject
here is not bodily death, because after his wrong, Adam continued
to live for a long time; rather, it refers to spiritual death, or in other
words, the loss of the assets that result from moral advancement, a
loss that is symbolized in his expulsion from the garden of delights.
       17. Nowadays, the serpent is far from personifying slyness.
Thus, here, with respect to its form rather than its character, it
is an allusion to the perfidy of bad counsel, which slithers like a
serpent, and so, for that very reason, is often not to be trusted.
Furthermore, if the serpent was condemned to crawl upon its belly
for having deceived the woman, this would mean that it formerly
had legs, and in that case it was not actually a serpent. Why, then,
impose on the naïve and credulous faith of children such obvious
allegories as truths, and which, in violating their reason, will make
them later regard the Bible as a web of absurd fables?
       Additionally, one should note that the Hebrew word
nâhâsch, translated as serpent, comes from the root nâhâsch,
which means to cast spells, to divine occult matters, and can thus
mean spell-caster, diviner. It is found with this meaning in
Genesis 44:5,15 in reference to the goblet that Joseph ordered to
be hidden in Benjamin’s bag: “The goblet that you have stolen
is that from which my Lord drinks, and which he uses to divine
(nâhâsch).110 – Did you not know that no one is my equal in
the knowledge of divination (nâhâsch)?” In Numbers 23:23
it states, “There are no spells in Jacob, nor diviners in Israel.”
Consequently, the word nâhâsch also had the meaning of serpent,


110
      Would this fact lead us to think that the Egyptians knew about mediumship involving
      a glass of water? (Revue Spirite, June 1868, p. 161) – Auth. [The article in Revue Spirite
      describes facts related to a type of seeing mediumship (clairvoyance) consisting in the
      ability of a medium to see things in a glass of water, which could be explained as fluidic
      images projected in the water by spirits. – Tr.]

or reptile, which spell-casters pretended to be able to enchant, or
which they used in their spell-casting.
       It was only in the Septuagint version (which, according to
Hutcheson, corrupted the Hebrew text in several places) written
in Greek in the second century B.C. that the word nâhâsch was
translated as serpent. The inaccuracies of this version are no doubt
connected to modifications that the Hebrew language had gone
through from time to time, because the Hebrew of Moses’ time
was by then a dead language that differed from common Hebrew,
just as ancient Greek and literary Arabic differ from modern Greek
and Arabic.111
       Hence, it is likely that Moses understood the seducer of the
woman to be the indiscrete desire to know about secret matters
aroused by the spirit of divination, which is in agreement with the
original meaning of the word nâhâsch, diviner, and on the other
hand, with these words: “God knows that as soon as you have eaten
the fruit, your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods. – The
woman saw that the tree was desirable for understanding (léaskil)
and she took of its fruit.” One must not forget that Moses wanted
to proscribe among the Hebrews the art of divination in use among
the Egyptians, hence his prohibition against questioning the dead
and his prohibition regarding the spirit of Python. (See Heaven
and Hell according to Spiritism, chap. XII)
      18. The passages where it is stated that, “The Lord strolled
through paradise after midday when a soft wind was blowing” is
a naïve image and a bit puerile, which criticism has not failed to
point out; however, there is nothing surprising in it if we recall the
idea the Hebrews of early times had about the Divinity. For such
unsophisticated minds incapable of conceiving abstractions, God

111
      The term nâhâsch existed in the Egyptian language with the meaning of black, probably
      because Blacks had the gift of spell-casting and divination. This was also perhaps why the
      Sphinxes – of Assyrian origin – were represented by the figure of a Black. – Auth.

had to have a concrete form, and they related everything to humanity
as their sole point of comparison. That is why Moses spoke to them
as children by using discernible images. In the case at hand, the
Supreme Power was personified, just as the pagans personified the
virtues, vices and abstract ideas with allegorical figures. Later on,
humans rid themselves of the idea of form, like a child who becomes
an adult and seeks the moral meaning in the tales with which he or
she used to be rocked to sleep. Thus, one must regard this passage
as an allegory of the Divinity itself watching over the objects of
creation. The great Rabbi Wogue translated it this way: “They heard
the voice of the Eternal God moving through the garden from the
side from which the day comes.”
       19. If Adam’s wrong consisted literally in having eaten a
fruit, such wrong, due to its almost puerile nature, incontestably
could not justify the harshness with which he was struck, nor could
one any more rationally believe that the event could have been as
is generally supposed; otherwise, by considering the incident as an
unforgivable crime, God would be condemning his own work, since
he had created the man for propagation. If Adam had understood in
this sense the prohibition against touching the fruit of the tree and
had scrupulously conformed to it, where would humankind be and
what would have become of the Creator’s designs?
       God did not create Adam and Eve to remain alone on the
earth, and the proof of this is in the very words that he speaks to
them right after having formed them and when they were still
in the earthly paradise: “God blessed them and said, ‘Increase
and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it.’” (Gen. 1:28). Since
the multiplying of human beings was already a law in the earthly
paradise, their expulsion from it could not have been caused by the
supposed incident.
       What has given credibility to this supposition is the feeling
of shame that Adam and Eve felt before God, and which led

                                259

                        Genesis - Chapter XII


them to hide themselves. However, this very shame is a figure of
comparison: it symbolizes the confusion that all guilty persons feel
in the presence of someone they have offended.
       20. What then, exactly, was that wrong which was so great
that it could cause the perpetual reprobation of all the descendants
of the one who committed it? The fratricidal Cain was not dealt
with so severely. No theologian can define it logically, because they
all take it literally and thus go around in a vicious circle.
       Today, we know that this wrong was not an isolated, personal
act by an individual, but that, beneath a unique allegorical event,
it comprises the whole of the sins for which imperfect earthly
humankind is guilty, and which are summed up in these words:
the infraction of God’s laws. This is why the wrong of the first man,
symbolizing all humankind, is portrayed as an act of disobedience.
       21. By telling Adam that he would take his food from the
earth with the sweat of his brow, God symbolizes the obligation
of labor; but why does he make labor a punishment? What would
human intelligence be if it were not developed through labor?
What would the earth be if it were not fertilized, transformed and
made habitable through intelligent human labor?
       Genesis 2:5,7 states, “The Lord God had not yet caused
it to rain upon the earth and there were no human beings to
work it. Then the Lord formed man from the clay of the earth.”
These words, much like “Fill the earth,” show that, from their
beginning, humans were intended to occupy all the earth and
cultivate it, and that, moreover, the terrestrial paradise was not a
circumscribed place in one corner of the globe. If the cultivating
of the earth had been the consequence of Adam’s wrong, it
would follow that, if Adam had not sinned, the earth would have
remained uncultivated, and that God’s objectives would not have
been accomplished.


                                260

                         The Mosaic Genesis


        Why did God tell the woman that, because she had
committed her wrong, she would give birth in pain? How could
the pain of childbirth be a punishment, since it is the consequence
of the organism, and that it is physiologically proven that it is
necessary? How could something that is in accordance with the
laws of nature be a punishment? This is what the theologians have
not yet been able to explain, and they will never be able to explain
it as long as they do not abandon the point of view where they have
placed themselves. Nonetheless, these seemingly contradictory
words can be explained.
        22. First of all, we notice that if, at the moment of Adam
and Eve’s creation, their souls were taken from nothingness – as
is still taught – they would have been inexperienced in all things;
they could not have known what it meant to die. Since they were
alone on earth while they lived in the earthly paradise, they never
could have seen anyone die. Then how could they have understood
what God’s death threat entailed? How could Eve have understood
that giving birth in pain would be a punishment since she herself
had just been born to life, had never had children, and was the
only woman in the world?
        Therefore, God’s words would have made no sense to Adam
and Eve. Since they had just been taken from nothingness, they
could not have known how or why they had come from it. They
could have understood neither the Creator nor the reason for his
prohibition. Without any experience of life’s conditions, they
sinned like children who act without discernment, which makes
even more incomprehensible the terrible responsibility that God
laid upon them and upon the whole of humankind.
      23. What comprises an impasse for theology, Spiritism
explains without difficulty and in a rational manner by means
of the preexistence of the soul and the plurality of existences, a


                                261

                        Genesis - Chapter XII


law without which everything is a mystery and an anomaly in
human life. In fact, let us believe that Adam and Eve had lived
previously and everything is justified: God did not speak to them
as children, but as beings capable of understanding God and who
did understand – obvious proof that they had previous knowledge.
Furthermore, let us admit that they had lived on a more advanced
and less material world than ours, where the labor of the spirit
supplants the labor of the body; that, because of their rebellion
against God’s law – portrayed in their disobedience – they had
been excluded and exiled, as a punishment, on the earth, where
due to the nature of the globe, humans are subject to bodily labor,
then God would have been right in telling them: In the world
where you are going to live from now on, “you shall cultivate the
land and take from it your food with the sweat of your brow”; and
to the woman, “You shall give birth in pain”, because such is the
condition of this world. (See chap. XI, nos. 31 ff.)
       The earthly paradise, whose vestiges have been pointlessly
searched for on earth, was the symbol for the happy world where
Adam used to live, or rather the race of the spirits whom he
personified. The expulsion from paradise marks the moment in
which these spirits came to incarnate among the inhabitants of
this world, and the change in the situation that ensued. The angel
armed with the flaming sword, and who blocked the entrance to
paradise, symbolizes the impossibility for spirits of lower worlds to
enter higher ones before having merited it through purification.
(See below, chap. XIV, nos. 8 ff.)
      24. Cain (after the death of Able) answered the Lord, “My
iniquity is too great for me to obtain forgiveness. – You have
expelled me today from upon the earth and I will go hide myself
from your face. I will be a fugitive and wayfarer upon the earth and
therefore anyone who finds me will kill me.” The Lord responded,
“No, this shall not happen, for whoever kills Cain shall be most

                                262

                         The Mosaic Genesis


severely punished.” And the Lord put a sign upon Cain so that
those who found him would not kill him.
      After having withdrawn from the face of the Lord, Cain
became a wayfarer upon the earth and lived in the region east of
Eden. – And having known his wife, she conceived and gave birth
to Enoch. Cain built (vaïehi bôné; literally: was building) a city
which he called Enoch, the name of his son.” (Gen. 4:13-16)
       25. If one takes Genesis literally, these are the conclusions:
Adam and Eve were alone in the world after their expulsion from
the earthly paradise; only afterward did they have their sons, Cain
and Abel. Now, having killed his brother, Cain left for another
region and did not see his father and mother again; they were alone
once more. It was only much later, at 130 years of age, that Adam
had a third son named Seth. After the birth of Seth he continued
to live – according to the biblical genealogy – 800 years and had
more sons and daughters.
       Thus, when Cain settled to the east of Eden, there were
only three persons on the earth: his father and mother and he
himself, alone, away from them. Nonetheless, Cain had a wife and
a son. What woman could that have been and where could he have
found her? The Hebrew text says: He was building a city and not:
he built, which implies an on-going action and not a completed
one. However, a city presupposes inhabitants, because one could
not presume that Cain would build it for himself, his wife and son,
nor could he have built it by himself.
       One must therefore infer from this very narrative that the
region was already populated, and it could not have been populated
with descendents of Adam, who did not have any descendents
other than Cain.
       The presence of other inhabitants are equally inferred by
these words of Cain “I shall be a fugitive and a wayfarer and
whoever finds me will kill me,” and by God’s response to him. Of

                                263

                                     Genesis - Chapter XII


whom could he have been afraid would kill him and of what use
would have been the sign that God put upon him to save him if
there was no one who would find him? Thus, if there had been
other humans on the earth apart from Adam’s family, it is because
such humans were already there before him, which leads to this
result taken from the text of Genesis itself: Adam was neither the
first nor the only father of humankind. (See chap. XI, no. 34)112
        26. The understanding brought by Spiritism concerning
the relations of the spiritual principle and the material principle,
the nature of the soul, its creation in a state of simplicity and
unawareness, its union with the body, its unending evolutionary
march through successive existences and through worlds that
represent the many degrees on the path towards perfection, its
gradual liberation from the influence of matter through the use
of free will, the cause of its good or evil inclinations and of its
aptitudes, the phenomena of birth and death, the state of the spirit
in the errant state, and, finally, thefuture as a reward for its efforts
to improve itself and for its perseverance in the good, have been
necessary to shed light on all the parts of the spiritual Genesis.
        Thanks to this light, men and women can know henceforth
where they have come from, where they are going, why they are
on the earth, and why they suffer. They know that the future is
in their own hands and that the duration of their captivity on
this world depends on them. Rid of restrictive and trivial allegory,
Genesis appears grand and worthy of the majesty, the goodness,
and the justice of the Creator. Considered from this point of view,
it will confound disbelief and shall triumph over it.

      This idea is not new. La Peyrère, the learned theologian of the 17th century, in his book
      Prae-Adamitae, written in Latin and published in 1655, drew from the original biblical text,
      adulterated through translation, obvious proof that the earth was inhabited before Adam
      arrived. This opinion is currently that of many enlightened clerics. – Auth.

         Miracles in the Theological Sense
        1. Etymologically, the word miracle (from mirari, to
admire) means admirable, something extraordinary, surprising. The
Academy defines this word as an act of divine power contrary to the
known laws of nature.
        In its normal acceptation, this word, like so many others, has
lost its original meaning. From having a more generalized meaning,
it has become restricted to a particular order of phenomena. In the
thinking of the masses, a miracle implies the idea of a supernatural
event; in the theological sense it is a derogation from the laws
of nature, through which God manifests the divine power. This
is actually its common acceptation, which has become its proper
meaning, and it is only by comparison and metaphor that it is
applied to the ordinary circumstances of life.
        One of the characteristics of a miracle per se is that it is
inexplicable for the very fact that it occurs outside natural laws; this
is so much the idea that has been attached to it that if a miraculous
event can be explained, it is no longer a miracle, no matter how

                           Genesis - Chapter XIII


surprising it may have been at first. What gives credit to miracles
in the eyes of the Church is precisely their supernatural origin and
the impossibility of explaining them; the Church is so set on this
point that any likening of miracles to the phenomena of nature
is considered heresy, an attack against the faith. The Church has
excommunicated and even burned people at the stake for not
having wanted to believe in certain miracles.
        Another characteristic of the miracle is that it is unusual,
isolated and exceptional. The moment a phenomenon is
reproduced, whether spontaneously or intentionally, it shows that
it is subject to a law, and henceforth, whether that law is known or
not, it is no longer a miracle.
       2. Science performs miracles every day in the eyes of the
unlearned. If a man who was really dead were called back to life
through divine intervention, it would be a true miracle because it is
an event contrary to the laws of nature. However, if the man only
appears to be dead, if there is still within him a vestige of latent vitality,
and if science or a magnetic action manages to reanimate him, then
to knowledgeable persons it is a natural phenomenon, whereas in the
eyes of unlearned folk the event will pass as miraculous. If in the midst
of certain peasants a physicist launches an electric kite and causes
lightening to hit a tree, this new Prometheus will certainly be looked
at as being armed with a diabolical power. However, Joshua’s stopping
the movement of the sun, or rather, the earth – if one accepts the
event as factual – would be a true miracle, for there is no magnetizer
endowed with power great enough to perform such a wonder.
       Centuries of ignorance were steeped in miracles, because
anything whose cause was unknown passed as supernatural. To the
degree that science revealed new laws, the circle of the extraordinary
tightened. Nevertheless, science had not yet explored the entire
realm of nature, and consequently there was still a large part of it
left to the extraordinary.

                                     268

                       Characteristics of Miracles


       3. Having been expelled from the domain of materiality
by science, the extraordinary took refuge in that of spirituality,
which has been its last sanctuary. By demonstrating that the spirit
element is one of the living forces of nature – a force incessantly
acting concurrently with the material force – Spiritism brings
the phenomena that result from its workings back into the realm
of natural effects, because like the others, they too are subject
to the laws of nature. When the extraordinary is expelled from
spirituality, it will have no more reason to exist, and only then will
it be said that the time of miracles has passed. (See chap. I, no. 18)

      Spiritism Does Not Perform Miracles
       4. Therefore, Spiritism has come to do in its own turn what
each science has done when it first appeared: to reveal new laws
and, consequently, to explain the phenomena that are within the
jurisdiction of such laws.
       Of course, these phenomena are attached to the existence
of spirits and their intervention in the material world; well, it is
said, that is precisely what is supernatural about them. However, it
would have to be proven that the spirits and their manifestations
are contrary to the laws of nature; that, in this case, there is not,
nor can there be an application of one of those laws.
       A spirit is nothing but a soul that has survived the body. Since
the spirit does not die, it is the principal being, whereas the body
is only an accessory that is destroyed. Thus, the soul’s existence
is as natural after incarnation as it is during. It is subject to the
laws that govern the spiritual principle, just as the body is subject
to those that govern the material principle. However, since these
two principles have a necessary affinity, since they incessantly react
on each other, and since their simultaneous action results in the
movement and harmony of the whole, it follows that spirituality


                                  269

                        Genesis - Chapter XIII


and materiality are two parts of the same whole, one as natural as
the other, and that the former is not an exception, an anomaly in
the order of things.
       5. During its incarnation, the spirit acts on matter by
means of its fluidic body or perispirit; the same happens outside
incarnation. As a spirit and according to its capabilities, it does
what it used to do as a man or woman; however, since it no longer
has the corporeal body as its instrument, it uses, when necessary,
the physical organs of an incarnate, who then becomes what is
called a medium. It is like someone who cannot write by himself
and thus employs the hand of a secretary, or someone who does not
know a particular language and thus makes use of an interpreter. A
secretary and an interpreter are mediums for an incarnate, just as a
medium is the secretary or interpreter for a spirit.
       6. Since the environment in which spirits act and their
means of doing so are not the same as in the state of incarnation,
the effects are different. Such effects seem supernatural only
because they are produced with the help of agents that are not
the same as the ones that serve us. However, since these agents are
to be found in nature, and since the manifestations occur due to
certain laws, there is nothing supernatural or extraordinary about
them. Before the properties of electricity were known, electrical
phenomena passed as wonders in the eyes of certain people, but
after their cause became known, the extraordinary disappeared.
The same applies to spirit phenomena, which are no more outside
natural laws than are the electric, acoustical, luminous and other
types of phenomena that have served as a source for a multitude of
superstitious beliefs.
       7. Nonetheless, it will be said, you believe that a spirit can
raise a table and hold it up in the air without any point of support;
is that not a derogation from the law of gravity? Yes, from the law


                                 270

                      Characteristics of Miracles


that is known; but do we know every law? Before experiments
were performed entailing the lifting power of certain gases, who
would have said that a heavy apparatus carrying several people
could overcome the power of gravity? In the eyes of the common
folk, would that not have seemed extraordinary, diabolical?
A century ago, if anyone had proposed transmitting a message
500 leagues and receiving a response within a few minutes, that
person would have been regarded as insane; and if it had been
done, people would have believed that the Devil was at the
person’s command, because back then only the Devil was capable
of traveling so quickly. Nowadays, however, not only is such a
thing acknowledged as being possible, but it seems most natural.
Why then could not an unknown fluid in certain circumstances
have the property of counterbalancing the effect of gravity, just as
hydrogen counterbalances the weight of a balloon? Actually, that
is exactly what happens in the case of the table. (See The Mediums’
Book, pt. 2, chap. IV)
       8. Because they exist as part of nature, spirit phenomena
have been produced throughout time; but precisely because
they could not be studied through the material means available
to ordinary science, they remained for a much longer time than
other phenomena within the realm of the supernatural, whence
Spiritism has now extracted them.
       Based on inexplicable appearances, the supernatural has free
reign over the imagination, which wanders around in the unknown,
giving rise to superstitious beliefs. A rational explanation founded
on the laws of nature brings people back down to the ground of
reality, sets up a stopping point for the detours of the imagination
and destroys superstition. Far from extending the realm of the
supernatural, Spiritism restricts it to its farthest limits and takes
away its last refuge. If it encourages belief in the possibility of
certain phenomena, it hinders the belief in many others, for it

                                 271

                         Genesis - Chapter XIII


demonstrates, within the sphere of spirituality, just as science does
within the sphere of materiality, what is possible and what is not.
However, since it does not pretend to hold the final word on all
things, not even those that are within its jurisdiction, it does not
present itself as the absolute regulator of what is possible, and takes
into account knowledge that is reserved for the future.
        9. Spirit phenomena consist in the different modes of
manifestation of the soul, or spirit, whether during incarnation
or in the errant state. It is through its manifestations that the soul
reveals its existence, its survival after death, and its individuality.
It is judged by its effects; and since the cause is natural, the effect
is also natural. It is these effects that comprise the special object
of Spiritist research and study so as to arrive at as complete an
understanding as possible concerning the nature and attributes of
the soul, as well as the laws that govern the spiritual principle.
       10. To those who deny the existence of the independent
spiritual principle and, consequently, that of the individual
and surviving soul, all nature is limited to tangible matter; all
phenomena that are connected with spirituality are, from their
point of view, supernatural and, consequently, chimerical. By not
accepting the cause, they cannot accept the effect, and when the
effects are patent, they attribute them to imagination, illusion
and hallucination, and refuse to delve into them; hence among
them the preconceived opinion that renders them incapable
of judiciously appraising Spiritism because they start from the
principle of denying everything that is not matter.
       11. From the fact that Spiritism accepts the effects that are
the consequence of the existence of the soul, it does not follow
that it accepts all the effects qualified as being extraordinary or that
it proposes to justify them and give them credibility; or that it is
the champion of all dreamers, utopias, theoretical eccentricities or


                                  272

                                   Characteristics of Miracles


miraculous legends. One would have to know very little about it to
think this way. Its adversaries think they have opposed it with an
irrefutable argument, when, after having done erudite studies on
the convulsionaries of Saint-Médard, the camisards of Cevennes
or the nuns of Loudun, they discovered patent, incontestable
evidence of fraud. But are such tales the gospel of Spiritism? Have
its adherents ever denied that charlatanism has exploited certain
incidents to its own advantage; that the imagination created
them; and that fanaticism has highly exaggerated them? It is not
liable for the extravagances committed in its name any more than
science is liable for the abuses of ignorance, or true religion for the
excesses of fanaticism. Many critics have judged Spiritism based
on fairytales and popular legends, which are only fictions. It is the
same as judging history based on historical romances or tragedies.
       12. Spirit phenomena are most often spontaneous and
are produced without any preconceived idea on the part of the
persons who least think about them. Under certain circumstances
they can be precipitated by agents known as mediums. In the
former case, mediums are unconscious of what is produced through
their intermediation; in the latter, they act with full knowledge of
the fact; hence the distinction between conscious and unconscious
mediums. The latter are the most numerous and are frequently
found among the most obstinate disbelievers, who thus practice
Spiritism without realizing it or wanting to. For this reason,
spontaneous phenomena are of crucial importance because those
who obtain them cannot be suspected of deceit. Such is the case
with somnambulism, which, in certain individuals is natural
and unintentional, while in others it is brought on by means of
magnetic action.113

113
      The Mediums’ Book, pt. 2, chap. V. – Revue Spirite, examples: Dec. 1865, p. 370; Aug. 1865, p.
      231. – Auth.



                                                 273

                                      Genesis - Chapter XIII


       Regardless of whether or not the phenomena are the result
of an act of the will, the primary cause is exactly the same and
in no way does it deviate from natural laws. Therefore, mediums
produce absolutely nothing supernatural; consequently, they
perform no miracles. Even instantaneous healings are no more
miraculous than other effects because they are due to the action
of a fluidic agent performing the role of a therapeutic agent,
whose properties are no less natural for having been unknown
until today. The epithet thaumaturge114, given to certain mediums
through criticism that is ignorant of the principles of Spiritism, is
thus completely improper. The characterization of miracle given
by comparison to certain types of phenomena can only lead to
error regarding its true character.
       13. The intervention of unseen intelligences in spirit phenomena
do not render them any more miraculous than all the other phenomena
caused by invisible agents, because the unseen beings who populate
space are one of the forces of nature, a force whose action is as incessant
upon the physical world as it is upon the moral world.
       By enlightening us about this force, Spiritism gives us the
key to a multitude of matters inexplicable by any other means,
and which might have passed as miracles in days gone by. Just like
magnetism, Spiritism reveals a law, if not unknown, at least poorly
understood; or, better stated, the effects are known because they have
been produced throughout time; however, the law governing them
has not been, and it is the ignorance of this law that has engendered
superstition. Once this law became known, the extraordinary
disappeared and the phenomena entered the order of natural things.
Thus, spirits perform no more of a miracle by making a table turn or
the dead to write than doctors do when they bring a moribund back
to life, or physicists when they make lightening hit. Those who,

                      Characteristics of Miracles


with the aid of this science, claimed to perform miracles would be
either an ignoramus about the matter or a charlatan.
      14. Since Spiritism rejects all pretension of producing
extraordinary things, are there miracles outside of it in the usual
acceptation of the word?
      First of all, let us state that, among all the supposedly
miraculous events that occurred before the coming of Spiritism,
and which still occur nowadays, most, if not all, find their
explanation in the new laws that it has come to reveal. These
events, therefore, albeit under another name, are included in
the order of spirit phenomena, and as such represent nothing
supernatural. It is well understood that we are dealing only with
authentic events and not those which, under the label ‘miracles’,
are the product of despicable knavery aimed at exploiting
gullibility; nor are we referring to certain legendary events
which could have had some truth to them originally, but which
superstition enlarged to the absurd. It is these particular events
on which Spiritism has come to shed a light by furnishing the
means for separating error from truth.

           Does God Perform Miracles?
      15. As for miracles per se, since nothing is impossible
for God, they could of course be performed by God. Has this
happened? In other words, does God derogate from the laws
that God has established? It is not up to humans to prejudge the
acts of the Divinity and to subject them to the weakness of their
understanding. Nonetheless, regarding divine matters, we have
God’s own attributes as the criteria for our judgment. Supreme
power is combined with supreme wisdom, from which one must
conclude that God does nothing pointless.


                                 275

                         Genesis - Chapter XIII


       Why, then, would God perform miracles? To attest to God’s
power, it is said. However, does not God’s power manifest much
more impressively through the magnificent whole of the works
of creation, through the providential wisdom presiding over the
tiniest parts as well as the greatest, and through the harmony of
the laws that govern the universe, than through a few tiny and
childish derogations that any sleight-of-hand artist knows how to
imitate? What would be said of a skilled craftsman who, in order
to demonstrate his ability, dismantled the clock he had built – a
scientific masterpiece – just to show that he could undo what he
had made? On the contrary, would his knowledge not result more
from the regularity and precision of the movements?
       The matter of miracles per se is not, therefore, within the
jurisdiction of Spiritism; however, supported on the reasoning that
God does nothing pointless, it states the following opinion: Since
miracles are not necessary for the glorification of God, nothing in the
universe deviates from the general laws. God does not perform miracles,
because, since the divine laws are perfect, God has no need to derogate
from them. If there are occurrences that we do not understand, it is
because we still lack the necessary knowledge.
        16. If we were to believe that, for reasons indiscernible
to us, God could derogate unexpectedly from the laws God has
established, such laws would no longer be immutable; but at least
it is rational to think that only God has such power. One could
not believe, however, without denying God’s omnipotence, that
such power would have been given to the Spirit of Evil to undo the
work of God by performing his own wonders in order to seduce
even the elect, for that would imply the idea of a power equal
to God’s. Nevertheless, that is what is taught. If Satan has the
power to suspend the course of natural laws – which are the divine
work – without God’s permission, then he is more powerful than
God. Hence, God would not be omnipotent; if God delegates

                                  276

                      Characteristics of Miracles


such power to him – as proposed – to lead people into evil more
easily, God would no longer be supremely good. In either case
there is a denial of one of the attributes without which God would
not be God.
        The Church also distinguishes good miracles, which come
from God, from evil miracles, which come from Satan. But what
is the difference? Whether a miracle is satanic or divine, it would
nonetheless be a derogation from the laws issued by God alone.
If an individual is healed by a supposed miracle, whether by God
or Satan, the person is healed nonetheless. One would have to
have a very poor idea about human intelligence to think that such
doctrines could be accepted nowadays.
        Recognizing the possibility of certain reputedly miraculous
phenomena, one must conclude that whatever the source attributed
to them, they are natural effects, which, like everything else, both
spirits and incarnates may use, as they can their own intelligence
or scientific knowledge, for either good or for evil, depending on
their goodness or perversity. A perverse being making use of his or
her knowledge can thus do things that pass as wonders in the eyes
of the uninformed; however, when such effects result in something
good, it would be illogical to attribute them to a diabolical origin.
      17. But, it is said, religion is founded on phenomena that
are neither explained nor explainable. Unexplained, perhaps;
unexplainable – that is a different matter. Who knows what
discoveries and knowledge the future reserves for us? Without
mentioning the miracle of creation – the greatest of all without
argument – which today has entered the realm of universal law,
do we not see, under the control of magnetism, somnambulism
and Spiritism, ecstasies, visions, apparitions, perception-at-
distance, instantaneous healings, suspensions in the air, oral and
other types of communications with beings from the invisible
world, phenomena known since time immemorial, considered

                                 277

                         Genesis - Chapter XIII


yesterday as extraordinary, but shown today as belonging to the
order of natural things in conformance with the constitutive law
of beings? The sacred books are full of incidents of this kind,
qualified as supernatural. However, since similar and even more
extraordinary phenomena may be found in all the pagan religions
of antiquity, then if the veracity of a religion depended on the
number and nature of such incidents, then there is no telling
which one would have prevailed.

          The Supernatural and Religions
        18. To insist that the supernatural is the necessary foundation
of all religion, that it is the cornerstone of the Christian edifice, is
to uphold a dangerous thesis. Making the bases of Christianity
rest on the sole base of the extraordinary is to give it a fragile
support, whose stones are coming loose every day. This thesis,
of which eminent theologians have made themselves defenders,
leads directly to the conclusion that, at a given time, religion will
no longer be possible, not even the Christian religion, if what is
considered supernatural were shown to be natural, because no
matter how many arguments are packed into it, one will not be able
to maintain the belief that a particular incident is a miracle when
it has been proven not to be. So, the proof that an event is not an
exception to natural laws occurs when it can be explained by those
same laws and when, by being able to be reproduced through the
intermediation of any individual, it ceases to be the privilege of
saints. It is not the supernatural that is necessary for religions, but
rather the spiritual principle, which has erroneously been confused
with the extraordinary, and without which no religion is possible.
        Spiritism considers the Christian religion from a more
elevated point of view. It gives it a more solid base than miracles: the
immutable laws of God, which govern both the spiritual principle


                                  278

                       Characteristics of Miracles


and the material principle. This base defies both time and science,
because both time and science will come to sanction it.
       God is no less worthy of our admiration, our recognition or
our respect for not having derogated from the divine laws, which
are great especially because of their immutability. There is no need
of the supernatural to render to God the worship God is due.
Is nature not powerful enough by itself? What else must yet be
added to it to prove the supreme power? Religion will encounter
fewer disbelievers the more it is sanctioned by reason at every
point. Christianity has nothing to lose with such a sanction; on
the contrary, it has only to gain. If there has been anything that
could harm it in the opinion of certain individuals, it is precisely
the abuse of the supernatural and the extraordinary.
       19. It we take the word miracle in its etymological acceptation,
in the sense of something wonderful, we will have unending miracles
before our eyes. We breathe them in the air and walk over them with
our feet, because everything in nature is a miracle.
       Does one wish to give people, the unlearned, the poor in
spirit an idea of God’s power? Show them that the infinite wisdom
presides over everything: in the admirable organism of everything
that lives, the fructification of plants, and the appropriation of all
the parts of each being for its needs according to the environment
into which it has been called to live. Show them God’s action in
the sprig of a bush, in the flower that blooms, and in the sun
that gives life to everything. Show them God’s goodness in God’s
kindness for all creatures no matter how tiny they may be; in God’s
providence; in the reason for each thing to exist, none of which
are useless, and in the good that always comes out of an apparent
and temporary evil. Especially, enable them to understand that
true evil is the work of human beings and not of God. Do not
seek to scare them with a picture of eternal flames, which they no
longer believe in and which makes them question God’s goodness;

                                  279

                       Genesis - Chapter XIII


instead, encourage them with the certainty that they will be able
someday to redeem themselves and right the evil they might have
committed. Show them the discoveries of science as revelations
of the divine laws and not as works of Satan. Finally, teach them
to read the book of nature that is constantly open right in front
of them; in that inexhaustible book, where the wisdom and
goodness of the Creator is inscribed on each page. Then they will
comprehend that a Being who is so great and concerned about
everything, who watches over everything and foresees everything,
must be supremely powerful. Farmers will see God whenever they
plow their furrows and the unfortunate will bless God in their
afflictions, because they will say to themselves, “If I am unhappy,
it is my own fault.” Then, men and women will be truly religious
and rationally religious especially, much more so than if they
believe in stones that sweat blood or statues that blink their eyes
and shed tears.

     I. Nature and Properties of the Fluids
                    The Fluidic Elements
       1. Science has provided the key to the miracles that result
most particularly from the material element, either by explaining
them away or by demonstrating their impossibility by means of the
laws that govern matter. However, the phenomena in which the
spiritual element plays a preponderant part cannot be explained
solely by means of the laws of nature and are thus outside the
investigations of science. This is why they possess, more than the
others, the apparent characteristics of the extraordinary. Hence,


                               281

                                    Genesis - Chapter XIV


it is within the laws that govern the spirit life that the key to the
miracles of this category may be found.
       2. As has already been demonstrated, the universal
cosmic fluid is the primitive elementary matter, whose
modifications and transformations comprise the innumerable
variety of bodies found in nature (see chap. X). As the universal
elementary principle, it offers two distinct states: etherization
or imponderability, which may be considered the normal
primitive state, and materialization or ponderability, which is in
a certain way only consecutive to the former. The intermediary
point is the transformation of the fluid into tangible matter.
However, even then there is not a brusque transition, because
our imponderable fluids may be regarded as a halfway phase
between the two states. (See chap. IV, nos. 10 ff.)
       Each of these two states necessarily gives rise to special
phenomena: to the latter belong those of the visible world and
to the former those of the invisible world. Some, called material
phenomena, are within the jurisdiction of science per se; the
others, qualified as spirit or psychic phenomena because they are
most specially connected with the existence of spirits, fall within
the attributions of Spiritism. Nonetheless, since the spirit life
and the corporeal life are constantly in contact with each other,
the phenomena of these two orders often appear simultaneously.
While in the incarnate state, people can perceive only the psychic
phenomena that are linked to the corporeal life; those of the
exclusive domain of the spirit life are outside the physical senses
and can be perceived only in the spirit state.115

115
      The label psychic phenomenon more precisely expresses this thought than does the label
      spirit phenomenon, keeping in mind that such phenomena rest upon the properties and
      attributes of the soul, or rather, the perispiritual fluids, which are inseparable from the
      soul. This qualification connects them more closely with the order of natural phenomena
      governed by laws; thus, they may be accepted as psychic effects without being accepted
      under the label miracles. – Auth.

                               The Fluids


       3. In the state of etherization, the cosmic fluid is not uniform.
Without ceasing to be ethereal, it undergoes modifications highly
varied in kind and perhaps more numerous than in the state of
tangible matter. These modifications comprise the different
fluids, which, even though proceeding from the same principle,
are endowed with special properties and give rise to the particular
phenomena of the invisible world.
       Since everything is relative, these fluids have for spirits –
who are fluidic themselves – an appearance as material as that of
tangible objects for incarnates, and are to them what the substances
of the terrestrial world are to us. They prepare and combine them
to produce certain effects, just as incarnates do with their materials,
although by means of different processes.
       There, as in this world, however, only the most enlightened
spirits are able to comprehend the role performed by the
constitutive elements of their world. The unlearned spirits of
the invisible world are as incapable of explaining the phenomena
they witness, and in which they often mechanically take part, as
the unlearned of the earth are of explaining the effects of light or
electricity, or of explaining how it is that they can see and hear.
       4. The fluidic elements of the spirit world are outside the
scope of our analytical instruments and the perception of our
senses, which have been made for tangible matter and not ethereal
matter. There are those that belong to an environment that is so
different from our own that we cannot imagine them except by
comparisons that are as imperfect as those by which a person blind
from birth would try to get an idea about the theory of colors.
       Nonetheless, among such fluids there are some that are
intimately connected with corporeal life and which belong in a
certain manner to the earthly environment. Even though they
cannot be perceived directly, their effects can be observed, just like
the effects of the fluid of a magnet, which has never been seen

                                  283

                         Genesis - Chapter XIV


but whose nature may be understood with certain precision. Such
study is essential because it is the key to a multitude of phenomena
that cannot be explained solely by the laws of matter.
       5. The starting point for the universal fluid is its degree
of absolute purity, about which nothing can give us an idea;
the opposite point is its transformation into tangible matter.
Between these two extremes are innumerable transformations that
approximate one extreme or the other to varying degrees. The fluids
closest to materiality, and consequently the least pure, comprise
what may be called the spiritual atmosphere of the earth. It is within
this environment – also comprised of various degrees of purity – that
the incarnate and discarnate spirits of the earth absorb the elements
needed for the economy of their existence. As subtle and intangible
as these fluids may be to us, they are nevertheless of a rather coarse
nature when compared to the ethereal fluids of the higher spheres.
       The same occurs on the surface of all worlds, except for
the differences in their constitution and the conditions of vitality
proper to each one. The less material the life on them, the less
affinity the spiritual fluids have with matter per se.
       The characterization spiritual fluids is not strictly
precise, because in reality they are still, in fact, matter that is
quintessentialized to varying degrees. There is nothing truly
spiritual except the soul or intelligent principle. The spiritual fluids
are thus designated as such for comparison because of their special
affinity with spirits. One could say that they comprise the matter
of the spirit world, which is why they are called spiritual fluids.
       6. Besides, who knows the innermost composition of
tangible matter? Perhaps it is compact only in relation to our
senses. This may be demonstrated by the ease with which spiritual
fluids and spirits pass right through it. It offers no more of an
obstacle to them than what transparent objects offer to light.


                                  284

                              The Fluids


       Having as its primitive element the ethereal cosmic fluid,
tangible matter should be able to return to the state of etherization
upon disaggregation, just as the diamond, the hardest substance
known, can be volatilized into intangible gas. The solidification
of matter is in reality only a transitory state of the universal fluid,
which can return to its primitive state when the conditions needed for
cohesion cease.
       Who knows whether in the state of tangibility matter is
not susceptible to acquiring a sort of etherization that endows it
with particular properties? Certain phenomena that seem to be
authentic would tend to support such an idea. For now, however,
we only possess the indicators of the invisible world; the future
undoubtedly holds for us the knowledge of new laws that will
enable us to understand what is still a mystery.
     The Formation and Properties of the Perispirit
      7. The perispirit, or the fluidic body of spirits, is one of the
most important products of the cosmic fluid. It is a condensation
of that fluid around a focal point of intelligence or soul. We have
already seen that the corporeal body also has its origin in this
same fluid condensed and transformed into tangible matter. In
the perispirit, the molecular transformation operates differently
because the fluid retains its imponderability and ethereal qualities.
The perispiritual body and the corporeal body thus have their
source in the same primitive element; both are matter, although
in two different states.
       8. Spirits extract their perispirit from the environment
in which they find themselves, which means that this envelope
is formed from environmental fluids. The result is that the
compositional elements of the perispirit must vary according to the
different worlds. Since Jupiter is indicated as being a highly evolved
world when compared to earth, and is an orb where corporeal life


                                 285

                                     Genesis - Chapter XIV


does not have the materiality of our own, perispiritual envelopes
there must be of an infinitely more quintessentialized nature
than upon the earth. So, just as we could not exist on that world
with our corporeal body, neither could our spirit go there with
its earthly perispirit. When the spirit emigrates from the earth, it
also leaves behind its fluidic envelope and puts on another that is
suited to the world where it is going.
       9. The nature of the fluidic envelope always has to do with
the spirit’s degree of moral advancement. Less evolved spirits
cannot change envelopes at will, and, consequently, cannot go
from one world to another at will. There are some whose fluidic
envelope, even though quite ethereal and imponderable with
respect to tangible matter, is still too heavy – if we may so express
ourselves – with respect to the spirit world to allow them to leave
their environment. In this category one must include those whose
perispirit is so dense that they confuse it with their corporeal body,
and who, for that reason, believe they are still among the living.
These spirits – and there is a great number of them – remain on
earth’s surface like incarnates, believing they are still minding their
earthly concerns. Others, although a little more dematerialized,
are not sufficiently so to ascend above the terrestrial realms.116
       Highly evolved spirits, on the other hand, can go to lower
worlds and can even incarnate on them. They draw from the
compositional elements of the world they enter the materials to
form the fluidic or corporeal envelope that is appropriate to the
environment in which they find themselves. They are like great
lords who leave their fine clothes in order to don temporarily the
garb of serfs, but without ceasing to be great lords because of it.
       This is how spirits of the highest order can manifest
themselves to earth’s inhabitants or incarnate on a mission amongst

116
      Examples of spirits who think they are still in this world: Revue Spirite, Dec. 1859, p 310;
      Nov. 1864, p. 339; Apr. 1865, p. 117 – Auth.



                                                286

                                The Fluids


them. Such spirits do not bring their envelope with them, but
rather their remembrance through intuition of the regions whence
they have come, and which they see by means of thought. They are
seers amongst the blind.
        10. The layer of spiritual fluids that surround the earth
may be compared to the lower layers of the atmosphere, which are
heavier, denser and less pure than the upper layers. These fluids are
not homogenous; they are a mixture of molecules of diverse qualities,
among which one necessarily finds the elementary molecules that form
their base, although altered to various degrees. The effects produced by
these fluids will result from the sum of the pure parts they contain. Such
is, for comparison, alcohol distilled or mixed in different proportions
with water or other substances: its specific density increases with this
mixture, while at the same time its strength and inflammability decrease
even though in the whole there is pure alcohol.
        The spirits called to live in this environment draw their
perispirits from it; however, depending on whether the spirit itself is
more purified or less so, its perispirit is formed of purer or denser parts
of the fluid suitable for the world where it incarnates. There, the
spirit produces – always by comparison and not by assimilation –
the effect of a chemical reaction that attracts to itself the molecules
that are in keeping with its nature.
        From this a crucial fact may be drawn: the inner composition
of the perispirit is not identical among all the incarnate or discarnate
spirits that populate the earth or the space surrounding it. However,
the same does not apply to the corporeal body, which, as has been
shown, is formed of identical elements, however highly or little
evolved the spirit may be. Also, the effects produced by the body
are the same for everyone and their needs are the same, whereas
everybody is different with respect to their perispirit.
        A further result: the perispiritual envelope of the same spirit
changes with its progress in each incarnation even if it incarnates in

                                   287

                          Genesis - Chapter XIV


the same environment; in the exceptional case where high order spirits
incarnate on missions on a less evolved world, they have a less dense
perispirit than the indigenous inhabitants of that world.
        11. The environment always has to do with the nature of
the beings that must live in it: fish are in the water; land beings, in
the air; and spirit beings in the spiritual or ethereal fluid, even on
earth. The ethereal fluid is to the needs of spirits what the atmosphere
is to the needs of incarnates. So, just as fish cannot live in the air and
land animals cannot live in an atmosphere too rarified for their
lungs, low order spirits cannot bear the radiance and impact of
the most ethereal fluids. They would not die while in such fluids,
because the spirit does not die, but an instinctive force keeps them
away, just as incarnates stay away from a very hot fire or a very
bright light. That is why they cannot leave the environment that is
suited to their nature. In order to change environments, they must
first change their nature. They must rid themselves of the material
instincts that keep them in material environments; in other words,
they must purify and transform themselves morally. Then, they
will gradually identify with a more purified environment, which
becomes a need for them, a necessity, like the eyes of someone
who has lived in darkness for a long time imperceptibly grow
accustomed to the light of day and the brilliance of the sun.
        12. Thus, everything in the universe is connected, everything
forms a chain; everything is subject to the grand and harmonious
law of unity, from the most physically dense to the most spiritually
purified. The earth is like a vessel from which a thick smoke escapes:
as it rises higher its rarified particles become lost in infinite space.
        The divine power shines in every part of this grandiose whole,
but in order for God to attest to God’s might in a more impressive
way, and not being content with what God has already done, there
are some who would have God come and upset such harmony!


                                   288

                               The Fluids


They would have God stoop to the role of stage magician through
childish effects worthy of a sleight-of-hand artist! In addition,
there are those who would dare propose Satan himself as God’s
rival in skillfulness! Truly, the divine majesty has never been so
lowered, and yet we are still astounded at the progress of disbelief!
        You are right to say, “Faith is dead,” but it is the faith in
anything that shocks common sense and reason that is dead; the
faith similar to the kind that used to make people say, “The gods
are dead!” However, faith in serious matters, the faith in God and
immortality, has always lived in the human heart, and even if it has
been suffocated under the childish stories that have overburdened
it, it reveals itself all the stronger from the moment it is liberated,
like a withered plant rises again as soon as it receives the sun!
        Yes, everything in nature is a miracle, because everything is
wonderful and bears witness to the divine wisdom! Such miracles
are for the whole world, for all who have eyes to see and ears to
hear – not for just a few! No! There are no miracles in the meaning
that has been connected with the word, because everything derives
from the eternal laws of creation and such laws are perfect.
     The Action of Spirits upon the Fluids; Fluidic
          Creations; Thought Photography
        13. The spiritual fluids, which comprise one of the states of
the universal cosmic fluid, are, properly stated, the atmosphere for
spirit beings; it is the element from which they draw the matter
upon which they operate; it is the environment where special
phenomena occur, perceptible to the spirit’s sight and hearing, but
beyond the corporeal senses, which are impressed solely by tangible
matter. It is where that light which is particular to the spirit world
is formed, and which is different from ordinary light through its
causes and its effects. Finally, it is the vehicle for thought, like the
air is the vehicle for sound.


                                  289

                          Genesis - Chapter XIV


        14. Spirits act upon the spiritual fluids, but they do not
manipulate them like humans manipulate gases; instead, they use
the help of thought and will. Thought and will are for spirits what
hands are to humans. By means of thought they impress upon the
fluids this or that direction; they agglomerate, combine or disperse
them; they form them in ensembles having a single appearance,
shape and certain coloration; they alter their properties as a chemist
alters gases or other substances, combining them according to
certain laws. It is the great workshop or laboratory of the spirit life.
        Sometimes these transformations are the result of intent;
frequently, however, they are the product of an unconscious
thought. It is enough for a spirit to think about something in order
for it to be produced, just as it is enough for the spirit to intone a
melody in order for it to resound in the atmosphere.
        For example, this is how a spirit makes itself visible to an
incarnate endowed with psychic sight, appearing in the same form it
had while alive at the time in which it was known, even if it has had
many incarnations since then. It presents itself in the same clothing
and with the same outward signs – infirmities, scars, amputated limbs,
etc. – that it had then. A beheaded person will appear without a head.
This does not mean that it has retained such an appearance – certainly
not – for as a spirit it is not lame, maimed, cross-eyed or headless.
But going back in thought to the time in which it had been this way,
its perispirit instantly takes on the appearance, just as it will instantly
drop it the moment the thought ceases. Hence, if it had been black at
one time and then white at another, it will present itself either as black
or white depending on which of the two incarnations for it is being
evoked, and to which it goes back in thought.
        Through a similar effect, the spirit’s thought fluidically
creates the objects that it had had the habit of using. A miser will
finger gold; a soldier will bear arms and wear a uniform; a smoker
will use a pipe; a laborer will have his plow and cattle, and an old


                                   290

                                              The Fluids


woman her distaff117. Such fluidic objects are as real to the spirit –
who is also fluidic – as they are in the material state to the live
individual; however, since they are creations of its thought, their
existence is as fleeting as the thought itself.118
        15. Since the fluids are the vehicle for thought, thought acts
upon the fluids as sound acts upon the air; fluids bring thought
to us just as the air brings sound. One could truthfully state,
therefore, that in these fluids there are waves and rays of thought
that crisscross one another without mixing, just as in the air there
are sound waves and rays.
        There is more: as thought creates fluidic images, it is reflected
in the perispiritual envelope as in a mirror; there, it takes on a body
and photographs itself somehow. Suppose that a certain man, for
example, gets the idea to kill another. As impassive as his physical
body may be, his fluidic body goes into action by means of the
thought, which reproduces all the nuances; it fluidically executes
the motion, the act that he has the desire to accomplish. The
thought creates the image of the victim, and the entire scenario is
painted like a picture just as it exists in his mind.
        This is how the most secret movements of the soul reverberate
in the fluidic envelope; how one soul can read another soul like a
book and see what is imperceptible to the body’s eyes. However,
in seeing the intent, the soul can foresee the fulfillment of the
act that will result from it; but it cannot determine the moment
when it will be fulfilled, ascertain the details, or even affirm that
it will actually occur, since ulterior circumstances may modify the
plans and change the dispositions. It cannot see what is not yet in
the thought; what it does see is the habitual preoccupation of the
individual – his or her desires, plans and good or evil intentions.

                         Genesis - Chapter XIV


                     Qualities of the Fluids
       16. The action of spirits upon the spiritual fluids has
consequences of crucial and direct importance for incarnates.
Since these fluids are the vehicle for thought, which can modify
their properties, it is obvious that they must be impregnated with
the good or evil qualities of the thoughts that set them in motion,
and they change according to the purity or impurity of sentiments.
Evil thoughts corrupt the spiritual fluids just as harmful miasmas
corrupt breathable air. The fluids that surround evil spirits, or
which are projected by them, are therefore noxious, whereas those
that receive the influence of good spirits are as pure as the spirits’
degree of moral perfection allows.
        17. It would be impossible to draw up an enumeration or
classification of good and bad fluids, or to specify their respective
characteristics because of the fact that their diversity is as great as
is the diversity of thoughts.
        The fluids do not possess qualities sui generis, but rather
acquire them within the environment where they are developed.
They are modified by the emanations of that environment like the
air is modified by exhalations, and water by the salts of the surfaces
it crosses. According to the circumstances, their qualities are, like
those of air and water, temporary or permanent, which makes them
especially suited to producing these or those particular effects.
        The fluids do not have special labels. Like odors, they are
designated according to their properties, effects and original type.
From a moral point of view, they bear the mark of the sentiments
of hate, envy, jealousy, pride, selfishness, violence, hypocrisy,
goodness, benevolence, love, charity, tenderness, etc. From the
physical point of view, they are exciting, calming, penetrating,
acerbic, irritating, soothing, soporific, narcotic, toxic, reparatory,
expelling, etc. They become a force for transmission, propulsion,


                                 292

                               The Fluids


etc. A table of the fluids would thus contain all the passions,
virtues and vices of humankind, and all the properties of matter
corresponding to the effects they produce.
        18. Since humans are incarnate spirits, they have a portion
of the attributes of the spirit life, because they live that life as well
as the corporeal life, primarily during sleep but often in the waking
state as well. Upon incarnating, the spirit retains its perispirit with
the qualities proper to it, and the perispirit, as we know, is not
circumscribed by the body but radiates all around and envelops it
as in a fluidic atmosphere.
        Through its intimate union with the body, the perispirit
performs an extremely important role in the organism. Through its
expansion, it puts the incarnate spirit in a more direct relationship
with discarnate spirits and also with other incarnate ones.
        The thought of the incarnate spirit acts upon the spiritual
fluids in the same way as does the thought of discarnates spirits;
it is transmitted from spirit to spirit through the same means, and
depending on whether it is good or evil, it cleanses or contaminates
the surrounding fluids.
        If the ambient fluids are modified by the projection of
the thoughts of the spirit, its perispiritual envelope, which is a
constituent part of its being, and which directly and permanently
receives the impression of its thoughts, must bear the mark
of its good or evil qualities even more. Fluids contaminated by
emanations from evil spirits can be purified by expelling such
spirits, but their perispirit will always be what it is as long as the
spirit itself does not change.
        Since the perispirit of incarnates is of a nature identical to
the spiritual fluids, it assimilates them easily like a sponge soaking
up a liquid. These fluids exert an action upon the perispirit all the
more direct since, due to its expansion and radiation, the perispirit
is mixed together with them.

                                  293

                        Genesis - Chapter XIV


      As the fluids act upon the perispirit, it in turn reacts upon
the physical organism, with which it is in molecular contact. If its
emanations are good in nature, the body gets a healthy feeling from
them; if they are evil, the feeling is painful. If the evil emanations
are continuous and fierce, they can cause physical disorders; certain
diseases have no other cause.
      The environments where evil spirits abound are thus
impregnated with harmful fluids, which are absorbed by all the
perispirit’s pores just as pestilent miasmas are absorbed by the
pores of the body.
       19. This is what explains the effects that are produced
in meeting places. A gathering is a focal point where different
thoughts radiate. It is like an orchestra, a choir of thoughts,
where each one produces a note. The result is a multitude of
fluidic currents and emanations, from which each participant
receives an impression through the spiritual sense just as in a
musical choir each singer receives the impression of sounds
through the hearing sense.
       However, just as there are harmonious and discordant
sounds, there are also harmonious and discordant thoughts. If the
group is harmonious, the impression is pleasant; if it is discordant,
the impression is uncomfortable. Moreover, there is no need for
thought to be formulated using words; the fluidic radiation exists
nonetheless, whether expressed or not.
       Such is the cause for the feeling of satisfaction that is
experienced in a sympathetic meeting animated by good and
benevolent thoughts. There, a healthy moral atmosphere reigns
where one may breathe easily; there, one feels comforted because
he or she is imbued with healthy fluidic emanations. But if there
is a mixture of a few bad thoughts, they produce the effect of a
current of icy air in a warm environment or a wrong note in a
concerto. This also explains the anxiousness, the indefinable ill-at-

                                 294

                               The Fluids


ease feeling that may occur in an antipathetic environment, where
malevolent thoughts provoke currents of nauseating fluid.
       20. Thought thus produces a kind of physical effect that
reacts upon one’s moral state – something that Spiritism alone can
make comprehensible. Persons feel this instinctively, since they
look for homogenous or sympathetic meetings where they know
they can absorb new moral strength. One could say that in such
meetings they recuperate the fluidic losses suffered daily due to the
radiation of thought, just as through nourishment they recuperate
the losses of the physical body. Actually, thought is an emission
that causes a real loss of spiritual fluids, and, consequently, physical
fluids, in such a way that persons need to re-strengthen themselves
in the emanations they receive from the outside.
       When one says that doctors heal their patients with good
words, this is an absolute truth, for a benevolent thought brings
with it reparatory fluids that act as much upon the physical as the
mental state.
      21. It is of course possible, one might say, to avoid persons
known to be ill-intentioned, but how can we avoid the influence
of the evil spirits who swarm around us and intrude everywhere
without being seen!
      The way to do so is quite simple, because it depends
on the will of persons themselves, who bear within them the
necessary protection. Fluids are combined due to the similarity
of their natures; dissimilar fluids repel one another. There is
incompatibility between good and bad fluids, just as there is
between water and oil.
      What do we do when the air is contaminated? We cleanse
it and purify it by destroying the concentration of the miasmas,
by expelling the malevolent emanations with stronger currents of
healthy air. The invasion of deleterious fluids must therefore be


                                  295

                          Genesis - Chapter XIV


opposed with good fluids, and since we all have in our own perispirit
a permanent fluidic source, we have the remedy within us. It takes
nothing more than purifying this source and giving it such qualities
that it may become a repellant of bad influences instead of being
an attracting force. The perispirit is therefore armor that must be
given the best possible caliber. Thus, because the qualities of the
perispirit result from the qualities of the soul, it is necessary to work
on improving it, because it is the soul’s imperfections that attract
evil spirits.
       Flies go where concentrations of decay attract them; destroy
the concentrations and the flies will disappear. Similarly, evil
spirits go where evil attracts them; eliminate the evil and they will
stay away. Truly good spirits, whether incarnate or discarnate, have
nothing to fear from the influence of evil ones.

     II. Explanation of certain Phenomena
           Reputed to be Supernatural
           Spirit or Psychic Sight; Second Sight;
                  Somnambulism; Dreams
        22. The perispirit is the link between the corporeal and
spirit life. It is through it that the incarnate spirit is in a continuous
relationship with discarnate spirits. In sum, it is through the
perispirit that special phenomena occur in certain humans. The
primary cause of these phenomena is not to be found in tangible
matter, and for that reason they might appear to be supernatural.
        It is in the properties and radiation of the perispiritual fluids
that one must search for the cause of second sight or spirit sight,
which may also be called psychic sight, with which many persons
are endowed, frequently without their being aware of it, just as
occurs with somnambulistic sight.

                                   296

                                         The Fluids


        The perispirit is the spirit’s sensory organ; through its
intermediation the incarnate spirit perceives spirit-related things
that are outside the corporeal senses. Through the body’s organs,
sight, hearing and the various other sensations are localized and
limited to the perception of physical things. Through the spiritual
or psychic sense they are generalized; that is, the spirit sees, hears
and feels in its entire being everything that is within the sphere of
its perispiritual fluidic radiation.
        In humans, such phenomena are the manifestation of the
spirit life; the soul is acting outside the organism. In second sight,
or perception through the psychic sense, they do not see through
the eyes of the body, although often, out of habit, they direct them
toward the point on which they have set their attention. They see
through the eyes of the soul, the proof of this being that they
see just as well with their eyes closed and they also see beyond
the reach of their line of vision. They read the thought portrayed
figuratively in the fluidic ray (see no. 15).119
       23. Although during life the spirit is held captive to the
body by the perispirit, it is not so enslaved that it cannot stretch
its chain and go to a distant point, whether on the earth or in
space. The spirit is only reluctantly attached to its body, because its
normal life is one of freedom, whereas its corporeal life is that of a
serf attached to the glebe. Consequently, the spirit is happy upon
leaving its body, like a bird leaving its cage; it seizes every occasion
to free itself from it, and hence takes advantage of every instant in
which its presence is not needed for its life of relationships. This is
the phenomenon designated by the name emancipation of the soul;
it always occurs during sleep. Every time the body is at rest, when
the senses are inactive, the spirit disengages itself. (See The Spirit’s
Book, pt. 2, chap. VIII)

       During these moments, the spirit lives the spirit life, whereas
the body lives only the vegetative life. It is partly in the state it will
be in after death: it travels space and converses with its friends and
other spirits who are either discarnate or incarnate.
       The fluidic tie that holds the spirit to the body is permanently
broken only at death, and complete separation occurs only with the
absolute extinction of the vital principle’s activity. While the body
is alive, the spirit, whatever distance away it might be, is instantly
called back once its presence is necessary. It then resumes the course
of its outward life of relationships. Sometimes, upon waking, it
retains a memory of its pilgrimages: a precise or imprecise image,
which comprises the dream. In any event, it brings back intuitions
that suggest new ideas and thoughts, justifying the proverb: The
night brings counsel.
       This also explains certain characteristic phenomena such as
natural and magnetic somnambulism, catalepsy, lethargy, ecstasy,
etc., which are none other than manifestations of the spirit life.120
       24. Since spirit sight does not operate by means of the eyes
of the body, it follows that the perception of things does not occur
by means of ordinary light. In fact, material light is made for the
material world; for the spirit world there is a special light whose
nature is unknown to us, but which is undoubtedly one of the
properties of the ethereal fluid impacting the visual perceptions
of the soul. Thus, there is material light and spiritual light. The
former has focal points circumscribed in luminous objects,
whereas the latter has its focal point everywhere. That is why there
are no obstacles to spirit sight; it is limited by neither distance nor
opacity of matter; darkness does not exist for it. The spirit world is
therefore illuminated by spirit light, which has its own effects, just
as the physical world is illuminated by the solar light.

                                The Fluids


       25. Enveloped by its perispirit, the soul thus carries its
own luminous principle, and since it penetrates matter due to its
ethereal essence, there are no objects opaque to its sight.
       Nevertheless, spirit sight entails neither the same extent nor
the same penetration in all spirits. Only pure spirits possess spirit
sight in all its power. In low order spirits it is weakened by the relative
density of the perispirit, which imposes itself like a kind of fog.
       Spirit sight manifests to different degrees in incarnate spirits
through the phenomenon of second sight, whether in natural
or magnetic somnambulism or whether in the waking state.
According to the degree of this faculty’s power, it is said that its
lucidity is greater or lesser. It is with the help of this faculty that
certain persons can see inside the human body and describe the
causes of illnesses.
       26. Spirit sight therefore provides special perceptions that
are not centered in the physical organs but rather operate under
different conditions than corporeal sight. That is why one cannot
expect identical effects from it or experiment with it using the
same procedures. Since it occurs outside the organism, it has a
mobility that frustrates all predictions. It is necessary to study it
as to its effects and causes, and not compare it to ordinary sight,
which it is not meant to replace except in exceptional cases that are
not to be taken as the general rule.
       27. Spirit sight is necessarily incomplete and imperfect in
incarnate spirits, and consequently it is subject to aberrations. Since
its seat is in the soul itself, the state of the soul must influence the
perceptions it provides. According to the degree of its development,
the circumstances and the moral state of the individual, spirit sight
can provide either during sleep or during the waking state: 1) the
perception of certain real physical events, such as knowledge of
events that occur far away, details describing a locality, the causes


                                   299

                                     Genesis - Chapter XIV


of an illness and appropriate remedies; 2) the perception of things
equally real in the spirit world, such as being able to see spirits;
3) fantastic images created by the imagination, analogous to the
fluidic creations of thought (see above, no. 14). Such creations
always go hand in hand with the moral dispositions of the spirit
that creates them. It is thus that the thoughts of persons who are
strongly imbued and preoccupied with certain religious beliefs
portray hell, its furnaces, its tortures and its demons just as they
imagine them to be. Sometimes it is an entire epopee. Pagans saw
Olympus and Tartarus just as Christians saw heaven and hell. If
upon waking or upon leaving the ecstatic state such individuals
retain an exact memory of their visions, they take them as realities
and confirmations of their beliefs, whereas they are nothing more
than a product of their own thoughts.121 Hence, ecstatic visions
must be strictly examined before accepting them. Under this
aspect, the remedy for excessive credulity is the study of the laws
that govern the spirit world.
      28. Dreams per se display the three types of visions described
above. The first two belong to prophetic dreams, presentiments
and warnings.122 It is in the third, that is, in the fluidic creations
of thought, that one can find the cause of certain fantastic images
that have nothing real about them as far as the material life is
concerned, but which for the spirit have a reality that is sometimes
such that the body suffers its repercussion – hair has even turned
white under the impression of a dream. Such creations can be
provoked by eccentric beliefs, by retrospective memories, by likes,
desires, passions, fear or regret, by habitual preoccupations, by
bodily needs, or by a breakdown in the functions of the organism;
121
      This explains the visions of Sister Elmerich, who, alluding to the time of Christ’s death,
      said she had seen material things that in fact have never existed except in the books she
      had read; those of Mme Cantanille (Revue Spirite, Aug. 1866, p. 240); and some of those of
      Swedenborg – Auth.

and finally, by other spirits with either a benevolent or malevolent
purpose, depending on their nature.123
                               Catalepsy; Resurrections
        29. Inert matter cannot feel, nor can the perispiritual fluid;
however, the latter transmits sensation to the sensory center, which
is the spirit. Painful corporeal lesions thus impact the spirit like
an electric shock through the intermediation of the perispiritual
fluid, for which the nerves seem to be the conducting wires. It
is the “nervous influx” of the physiologists, who, unaware of the
relationship of this fluid with the spiritual principle, are not able
to explain all its effects.
        This interruption can take place due to the separation of a
limb or the cutting of a nerve, but also, partially or generally, and
without any lesion, in the moments of the spirit’s emancipation,
great overexcitement or preoccupation. In this state, the spirit no
longer thinks of the body, and in its feverish activity it attracts to
itself, so to speak, the perispiritual fluid, which, in withdrawing
from the surface, produces a momentary numbness there. One
could further state that, in certain circumstances, a molecular
modification is produced in the perispiritual fluid, and this
modification temporarily deprives it of its transmitting ability.
That is why many times in the heat of battle a soldier does not
notice that he has been wounded; that a person whose attention
is concentrated on an endeavor does not hear the noise that is
spread all around. It is an analogous effect, but more pronounced,
that takes place with certain somnambulists during lethargy
or catalepsy. Finally, it is what may explain the insensibility of
convulsionaries and certain martyrs (See Revue Spirite, Jan. 1868:
“Etude sur les Aïssaouas.”).

       Paralysis does not have the same cause at all; the effect is
totally organic. It results from the fact that the nerves themselves,
which are the conducting wires, are no longer suitable for the
fluidic circulation – the strings of the instrument have been altered.
       30. In certain pathological states when the spirit is no
longer in the body and the perispirit adheres to it only at a few
points, the body displays all the appearances of death, and it is
the absolute truth to say that life is hanging on by only a thread.
Such a state may last for a longer or lesser length of time; some
parts of the body may even begin decomposing without life having
permanently gone out. As long as the last thread has not yet been
broken, the spirit can, whether by an energetic action of its own
will or whether by an equally powerful outside fluidic influx, be
called back to the body. This can explain certain prolongations
of life against all odds, and also certain supposed resurrections. It
is like a plant that sometimes sprouts from only a sprig of a root.
Nevertheless, when the last molecules of the fluidic body have
disengaged from the corporeal body, or when the latter is in an
irreparable state of decay, any return to life becomes impossible.124
                                        Healings
       31. As has been seen, the universal fluid is the primitive
element of both the corporeal body and the perispirit, which
are merely transformations of it. By its very nature this fluid,
condensed in the perispirit, can supply reparatory elements to the
body. The driving agent is the incarnate or discarnate spirit that
injects a portion of the substance of its fluidic envelope into a
deteriorating body. The healing occurs by replacing an unhealthy
molecule with a healthy one. The curative power is thus a direct

124

result of the purity of the injected substance; it also depends on
the energy of the will, which causes a more abundant fluidic
emission and gives the fluid a greater penetrating power; finally, it
depends on the intentions that animate the one who wants to do
the healing, whether a person or a spirit. The fluids that emanate
from an impure source are like adulterated medicinal substances.
       32. The effects of the fluidic action upon the ill are
extremely varied, depending on the circumstances. This action is
sometimes slow and requires a prolonged treatment, as in the case
of ordinary magnetism. At other times it is quick like an electric
current. There are individuals endowed with a power such that
they perform instantaneous healings on the ill simply by laying
their hands on them, or even solely through an act of their will.
Between the two poles of this faculty there are infinite variations.
All healings of this kind are varieties of magnetism and differ only
in intensity and speed of action. The principle is always the same: it
is the fluid that performs the role of therapeutic agent, and whose
effects depend on its quality and the particular circumstances.
       33. The magnetic action can be produced in several ways:
       1) By the magnetizer’s own fluid. This is magnetism per se,
or human magnetism, whose action depends on the power, and,
especially, the quality of the fluid;
       2) By the fluid of spirits acting directly and without
intermediary upon an incarnate, whether to heal or lessen
some kind of suffering, whether to bring about spontaneous
somnambulistic sleep, or to exert any physical or mental influence
on the individual. This is spirit magnetism, whose quality is the
direct result of the qualities of the spirit125;
       3) By the fluids that spirits pour out on the magnetizer, who
serves as the conductor. This is mixed or semi-spirit magnetism, or

if preferred, spirit-human magnetism. Combined with the human
fluid, the spiritual fluid gives it the qualities it lacks. In such
circumstances, the participation of spirits is sometimes spontaneous,
but more often is brought about at the request of the magnetizer.
       34. The faculty of healing via fluidic influence is very common
and may be developed through practice; but instantaneous healing
through the laying on of hands is rarer and possessing it to the highest
degree may be regarded as exceptional. Nonetheless, in many ages and
amongst nearly all cultures, individuals appeared who possessed it to
a high degree. In these latter times, many noteworthy examples have
appeared whose authenticity cannot be contested. Since healings of
this kind rest on a natural principle, and since the power to perform
them is not a privilege, it follows that they do not operate outside of
nature and they are miraculous in appearance only.126
                         Apparitions; Transfigurations
       35. In its normal state the perispirit is invisible to us, but
since it is formed of ethereal matter, the spirit can in certain
circumstances and through an act of its will cause it to undergo a
molecular modification that renders it momentarily visible. This is
how apparitions are produced, which, like all other phenomena, do
not occur outside the laws of nature. This is no more extraordinary
than steam, which is invisible when highly rarefied, but becomes
visible when condensed.
       Depending on the degree of condensation of the perispiritual
fluid, an apparition is sometimes vague and vaporous; at other
times it is more clearly defined; and, finally, at other times, it
has all the appearances of tangible matter. It can even attain true

tangibility to the point that the observer is fooled as to the nature
of the being in front of him or her.
       Vaporous apparitions are common and occur frequently
when individuals present themselves in such manner to their loved
ones after having died. Tangible apparitions are rarer, although
there have been numerous perfectly authenticated cases of them.
If a spirit wants to make itself known, it gives its envelope all the
outward markings that it had while living.127
       36. It should be noted that tangible apparitions have only the
appearances of corporeal matter – they could not possess its qualities.
Due to their fluidic nature, they cannot have the same cohesion as
matter, because, in reality, they are not made of flesh. They form
instantly and disappear the same way, or they evaporate through the
disaggregation of their fluidic molecules. The beings that appear under
such conditions are not born, nor do they die like human beings. They
are seen and no longer seen, without the observer knowing where they
have come from, how they have come or where they are going. No
one could kill, shackle or imprison them, since they have no corporeal
body; trying to hit them would result in striking a vacuum.
       Such is the nature of agenerates, with whom one may
communicate without suspecting what they are, but who do not
stay very long and cannot partake in the habitual sharing of food
at homes nor be counted among the members of a family.
       Moreover, in their entire person, in their steps, there is
something strange and unusual that derives from their materiality
and spirituality. Their gaze, vaporous and penetrating at the same
time, does not have the clarity of the gaze through corporeal eyes.
Their speech is brief and almost always terse, possessing nothing
of the luster or volubility of human speech. Their proximity makes
one feel an odd, indefinable sensation of unease that inspires a

sort of fear, and taken as individuals like all others, one may say
unintentionally, “Now that is a peculiar person.”128
       37. Since the perispirit is the same both in incarnates and
discarnates by means of a completely identical effect, an incarnate
spirit can, during a moment of freedom, appear in a place different
than where its body is lying, and display its customary mannerisms
and all the marks of its identity. This phenomenon, of which there
are many authenticated examples, has given rise to the belief in
human doubles.129
       38. One particular effect of this type of phenomena is
that vaporous and even tangible apparitions are not perceptible
to everyone indiscriminately. Spirits show themselves only when
they want and to whom they want. Thus, a spirit could appear to
a group or to one or more of those present without being seen by
the others. This happens because these types of perceptions occur
by means of spirit sight and not physical sight, because not only is
spirit sight not given to all persons, but it can be taken away by an
act of the spirit’s will from whoever it does not wish to show itself,
just as it can give it temporarily if it deems it necessary.
       The condensation of the perispiritual fluid in apparitions,
even to the point of tangibility, lacks the properties of ordinary
matter; otherwise, apparitions would be perceptible to the eyes of
the body and then everyone present would see them.130

      One must accept only with extreme reserve the tales of purely individual apparitions,
      which, in certain cases could be the effect of an overly excited imagination, and at times
      an invention with ulterior motives. Hence, one must scrupulously take into account the
      circumstances and the trustworthiness of the person, as well as any interest he or she may
      have in abusing the credulity of overly trusting individuals. – Auth.

                                            The Fluids


       39. Since the spirit can perform transformations within
the contours of its perispiritual envelope, and since this envelope
radiates all around the body like a fluidic atmosphere, a phenomenon
similar to an apparition can be produced on the surface of the
body itself. Under the fluidic layer, the real image of the body can
be erased more completely or less so and take on other traits; or the
original traits seen through the modified fluidic layer – as through
a prism – can take on a different expression. If, while setting aside
the everyday world, the incarnate spirit identifies itself with things
of the spirit world, the semblance of a homely face can become
beautiful, radiant and at times even luminous. On the other hand,
if the spirit is enticed by evil passions, an attractive face can take
on a horrendous appearance.
       This is what happens during transfigurations, which are
always a reflection of the predominant qualities and sentiments
of the spirit. This phenomenon is therefore the result of a fluidic
transformation. It is a type of perispiritual apparition that may
even be produced upon a living body, and sometimes at the
moment of death instead of at a distance, as in apparitions per
se. What distinguishes the apparitions of this kind is that they
are usually perceptible to everybody watching and by the physical
eyes, precisely because they are based on visible corporeal matter,
whereas in purely fluidic apparitions, there is no tangible matter.131
                  Physical Manifestations; Mediumship
       40. The phenomena of turning and talking tables, the
suspension of heavy objects in the air and mediumistic writing
are as ancient as the world itself; more common nowadays, they
provide the key to some of the spontaneous, similar phenomena
to which, due to ignorance about the law that governs them, have

been attributed a supernatural and miraculous character. Such
phenomena rest on the properties of the perispiritual fluid of
either incarnate or discarnate spirits.
        41. It is with the help of its perispirit that the spirit acts upon
its living body; furthermore, it is with this same fluid that it can
manifest itself by acting upon inert matter, which produces noises
and the movement of tables and other objects that it lifts, drops or
carries. These phenomena contain nothing surprising considering
that among us the most powerful motors may be found in the most
rarified and even imponderable fluids such as air, steam and electricity.
        It is also with the help of its perispirit that the spirit enables
mediums to write, speak or draw. Since it no longer has a tangible
body for acting ostensibly whenever it wants to manifest, it borrows
the organs of the medium’s body, which, by means of the fluidic
emanation that it pours out on it, makes act as if it were its own body.
       42. It is by the same means that the spirit acts upon a table,
whether to make it move without any predetermined meaning, or
whether to make it produce intelligent raps by indicating letters of
the alphabet in order to form words and sentences – a phenomenon
known as typtology. The table is merely an instrument the spirit
utilizes, as someone would utilize a pencil to write with. The spirit
endows it with a momentary vitality by means of the fluid it injects
into it; however, it does not become identified with it. Persons who,
in their emotion upon seeing a loved one manifest, embrace the
table perform a foolish act, because it is as if they were embracing
the stick that a friend uses to strike. The same applies to those who
talk directly to the table as if the spirit were contained within the
wood or as if the wood had become the spirit.
       When communications occur in this way, we must realize that
the spirit is not within the table but to the side just as it would be if
it were alive, and just as it would be seen if at that moment it could


                                   308

                                            The Fluids


make itself visible. The same applies to written communications:
the spirit could be seen beside the medium, guiding the hand or
transmitting its thought by means of a fluidic current.
       43. When the table leaves the floor and floats in the air
without any point of support, the spirit does not lift it with its
arms. It envelops it and injects it with a kind of fluidic atmosphere
that neutralizes the effect of gravity, as the air does with balloons
and kites. The fluid with which the table is injected momentarily
gives it greater specific lightness. When it remains stuck to the
floor, it is in a state like that of the pneumatic bell jar that has had
a vacuum created inside it. These are only comparisons for us to
show a similarity of effects and not an absolute similarity of causes.
(See The Mediums’ Book, pt. 2, chap. IV)
       Consequently, one should understand that it is no more
difficult for a spirit to lift a person than for it to lift a table, to carry
an object from one place to another, or to throw it somewhere – all
these phenomena are produced by the same law.132
       When the table chases someone, it is not the spirit who is running,
because it can remain peacefully in the same spot; it gives impulse to the
table by means of a fluidic current with the help of its will.
       When raps are heard within tables or elsewhere, the spirit
is not striking it with its hand or some other object. It directs a
stream of fluid to the point where the noise comes from and this

132
      Such is the principle of the phenomenon of apportations, a phenomenon that is quite
      real, but which should not be accepted except with extreme reservation, because it is
      one of those phenomena that lend themselves most easily to imitation and fraud. The
      undeniable honesty of the person who obtains them, his or her absolute material and
      moral disinterestedness, and the interplay of accompanying circumstances must be taken
      into consideration. It is especially necessary to distrust the excessive ease with which such
      effects are produced, and to be wary of those who recur too frequently and, so to speak,
      at will. Sleight-of-hand artists can do the most extraordinary things. The levitating of a
      person is a no less provable phenomenon, but much rarer, perhaps because it is more
      difficult to imitate. It is well known that Mr. Home levitated himself more than once up
      to the ceiling and then came down again. They say that St. Cupertin possessed the same
      ability, which is no more miraculous for one than the other. – Auth.

produces the effects of an electric jolt. The spirit can change the
sound just as one can modify the sounds produced by the air.133
       44. A highly frequent phenomenon in mediumship is the
ability of certain mediums to write in a language unknown to them
or to address subjects orally or by writing that are beyond the reach
of their education. It is not rare to see those who write correctly
without ever having learned how to write; others who compose poems
without ever having learned how to compose a verse; others who
draw, paint, sculpt, compose music or play an instrument without
knowing design, painting, sculpting or the art of music. It often
happens that writing mediums reproduce flawlessly the handwriting
and signature that the spirits who communicate through them used
while alive, even though such mediums had not known them.
       This phenomenon is no more extraordinary than that
of seeing children write by guiding their hand: one can make
them write what one wants. Anyone can be made to write in any
language by dictating the words to him or her letter by letter.
One can understand how the same would apply to mediumship if
one recalls the way in which spirits communicate with mediums,
who are actually for them no more than passive instruments. If
mediums possess the mechanism, if they have overcome the
practical difficulties, if they are familiar with the various terms,
and if, finally, they have in their brain the elements of whatever it
is that the spirit wants them to execute, they are in the situation of
someone who knows how to read and write correctly. The work is

easier and quicker; the spirit only has to transmit the thought that
its interpreter reproduces through the means at hand.
       The aptitude of mediums for things foreign to them is
also frequently connected with the knowledge they possessed
in another existence, and of which their spirit has retained an
intuition. For example, if they were poets or musicians it will be
easier to assimilate the poetic or musical thought that a spirit wants
them to reproduce. Languages unknown today could have been
known in another existence: hence a greater aptitude for writing
mediumistically in that language.134
                              Obsession and Possession
       45. Evil spirits swarm all around the earth as a result of the
moral backwardness of its inhabitants. The malevolent action of
such spirits makes up part of the calamities to which humankind is
exposed on this world. Obsession, which is one of the effects of this
action – like infirmities and all the other tribulations of life – should
therefore be regarded as a trial or an expiation and accepted as such.
       Obsession is the persistent action that an evil spirit
exerts upon a particular individual. It presents highly diverse
characteristics, from a simple mental influence without perceivable
outward signs to the complete disruption of the organism and the
mental faculties. It obliterates all mediumistic faculties. In auditory
and psychographic mediumship, it results from the obstinacy of a
spirit manifesting itself to the exclusion of all others.
       46. Just as infirmities are the result of physical imperfections
that render the body accessible to pernicious outside influences,
obsession is always the result of a moral imperfection that allows entry
134
      The aptitude that certain individuals display for languages they know – so to speak – without
      having learned them has no other cause than an intuitive memory of the language they knew in
      another existence. The example of the poet Méry, reported in Revue Spirite of Nov. 1864, p. 328, is
      evidence of this. It is obvious that if Mr. Méry had been a medium in his childhood, he would have
      written in Latin as easily as in French, and would have been proclaimed a prodigy. – Auth.

to an evil spirit. A physical cause may be opposed by a physical force;
a moral cause must be opposed by a moral force. In order to protect
oneself from infirmities one must strengthen the body; to guard
oneself against obsession, one must strengthen the soul; thus the need
of those who are the object of an obsession to work on their self-
improvement, which is often enough to rid themselves of an obsessor
without the help of outside persons. Such help becomes necessary
when the obsession degenerates into subjugation and possession,
because then the patient sometimes loses his or her will and free will.
        Obsession is nearly always an expression of vengeance taken
by a spirit; it most frequently has its source in the relationships
between the obsessed and obsessor in a previous life.
        In cases of severe obsession, the obsessed is as if enveloped
and impregnated with a pernicious fluid that neutralizes the action
of healthy fluids and repels them. It is this fluid from which the
obsessed must be disencumbered. Now, an evil fluid cannot be
repelled by an evil fluid. By means of an action identical to that of
a healing medium in cases of illness, it is necessary to expel the evil
fluid with the aid of a better one.
        This is the mechanical action, but it is not always enough;
above all, it is also necessary to act upon the intelligent being, with
whom one must have the right to speak with authority, and such
authority is not given except by moral ascendancy; the greater the
ascendancy the greater the authority.
        However, that is not all. In order to assure deliverance, it is necessary
to lead the perverse spirit to renounce its evil designs. It is necessary to
awaken in it repentance and the desire of the good, together with the aid
of skillfully guided instructions through particular evocations aimed at
its moral education. One can then have the sweet satisfaction of having
freed an incarnate and having converted an imperfect spirit.
        The task becomes easier when the obsessed understand their
situation and bring the concourse of their will and prayer. Such is


                                      312

                              The Fluids


not the case when the obsessed, seduced by the deceiving spirit, are
deluded as to the qualities of their obsessor and take pleasure in
the error in which they are immersed, because then, far from being
of any help, they reject all assistance. This is a case of fascination,
which is always infinitely more troublesome than the most violent
subjugation. (See The Mediums’ Book, pt. 2, chap. XXIII)
       In all cases of obsession, prayer is the most powerful help in
acting against an obsessor spirit.
       47. In obsession, the spirit acts outwardly with the help of
its perispirit, which becomes identified with that of the incarnate.
The latter then finds him or herself entwined in a mesh and
constrained to act against his or her will.
       In possession, instead of acting outwardly, the possessor spirit
replaces – so to speak – the incarnate one. It chooses to make his or
her body its home, but without the possessed person abandoning
it for good, since such can happen only at death. Consequently,
possession is always temporary and intermittent, because a
discarnate spirit cannot permanently take the place of an incarnate
one, since the molecular union of the perispirit and the body can
occur only at the time of conception. (See chap. XI, no. 18)
       Temporarily possessing the incarnate’s body, the spirit uses it
as though it were its own: it speaks through its mouth, sees through
its eyes and acts with its arms just as it would when alive. This is
not the same as in the case of speaking mediumship, where the
incarnate spirit speaks by transmitting the thought of a discarnate
spirit. In this case, it is the discarnate spirit who speaks and acts,
and if one knew it when it was alive, one would recognize it by its
language, its voice, its gestures and even its facial expressions.
      48. Obsession is always the act of a malevolent spirit.
Possession can be the act of a good spirit who comes to speak,
and in order to make a greater impression on its listeners, borrows


                                 313

                                        Genesis - Chapter XIV


the body of an incarnate who loans it voluntarily to it just as if
he or she were lending his or her garments. This occurs without
any disturbance or discomfort, and during this time the incarnate
spirit finds itself at liberty, as during the state of emancipation; but
more often it stands beside its replacement in order to listen to it.
        When the possessor spirit is evil, things are otherwise. It does
not borrow the body; it seizes it if its owner does not have the moral
power to resist. It does so through a nasty action toward the incarnate,
whom it tortures and torments in all sorts of ways, even so far as to
murder him or her either by strangulation or by throwing him or her
into the fire or other dangerous places. It makes use of the organs and
limbs of the unfortunate patient; it blasphemes, insults and mistreats
those who are nearby; it hands its victim over to eccentricities and acts
that display all the characteristics of raging insanity.
        Occurrences of this type, in different degrees of intensity, are
quite numerous, and many cases of insanity have no other cause.
Frequently, they are accompanied by pathological disorders that
are merely consequential, and against which medical treatments
are powerless as long as the originating cause persists. By making
known this source of a part of human miseries, Spiritism indicates
the means to remedy it: the way is to act upon the author of the evil,
who, as an intelligent being, must be treated by the intelligence.135
       49. Obsession and possession most frequently involve
individuals, but at times they are epidemic. Whenever a cloud of
evil spirits descends upon a locality, it is as if a troop of enemy
forces has come to invade it. In this case, the number of affected
individuals may be considerable.136

          The Superiority of Jesus’ Nature
       1. The phenomena reported in the Gospel, and which until
now have been considered miraculous, belong in their majority to
the order of psychic phenomena; that is, those that have the faculties
and attributes of the soul as their primary cause. In comparing
them to those that were described and explained in the preceding
chapter, one will have no difficulty in realizing that between the
two groups there is an identity of cause and effect. History has
shown that similar phenomena have occurred in all times and
among all cultures, the reason being that since there are incarnate
and discarnate souls, the same effects must have been produced. It
is true that one might contest the trustworthiness of history on this
point; however, today the phenomena are being produced right


                                 315

                         Genesis - Chapter XV


before our eyes, and, we might add, naturally and by individuals
who have nothing exceptional about them. The very fact that a
phenomenon can be reproduced under identical conditions is
sufficient to prove that it is possible and that it is subject to a
particular law; thus, from that point on, it is no longer miraculous.
       As we have seen, the principle of psychic phenomena rests
upon the properties of the perispiritual fluid, which constitutes
the magnetic agent; upon the manifestations of the spirit life
during incarnation and after death; and, finally, upon the
compositional state of spirits and their role as an active force
of nature. Once these elements are known and their effects
proven, one must consequently accept the possibility of certain
phenomena that were rejected as long as they were attributed to
a supernatural origin.
        2. Without any preconceptions as to the nature of
Christ – which is beyond the scope of this investigative work –
and considering him, hypothetically, only as a highly evolved
spirit, we must nonetheless recognize him as one of the highest
order, and that, due to his virtues, he is placed far above earthly
humanity. Because of the immense results that it produced, his
incarnation on this world could only have been one of those
missions that are entrusted to the direct messengers of the
Divinity in order to fulfill its designs. Even supposing that Christ
was not God per se, but a messenger from God sent to transmit
God’s word, he would be more than a prophet, for he would be
a divine messiah.
        As a man, he had the bodily composition of corporeal beings;
but as a pure spirit detached from matter, he would have lived the
spirit life more than the corporeal life, the weaknesses of which
he would not have had. The superiority of Jesus over other humans
was not linked to the particularities of his body, but to those of his
spirit, which dominated matter completely, and that of his perispirit,

                                 316

                         Miracles in the Gospel


which was drawn from the most quintessential portion of earth’s fluids
(see chap. XIV, no. 9). His soul must not have been connected
to his body except by strictly indispensable ties, and since it was
constantly detached, it must have given him a second sight that was
not only continuous but exceptionally penetrating and far superior
to anything seen among ordinary human beings. Such must have
also been the case regarding all the phenomena that depend on the
perispiritual or psychic fluids. The quality of these fluids endowed
him with an immense magnetic power seconded by his incessant
desire to do good.
       Did he act as a medium in the healings he performed? Could
he be considered as a powerful healing medium? No, because a
medium is an intermediary, an instrument that discarnate spirits
use. Christ, however, had no need of assistance; he was the one
who assisted others. Therefore, he acted by himself in virtue of his
own personal power, just as incarnates can do in certain cases and
according to the measure of their abilities. Moreover, what other
spirit would have dared to insufflate him with its own thoughts
and charge him with transmitting them? If he did receive an
outside influx, it could only have been from God. According to
the definition given by one spirit, Christ was God’s medium.

                             Dreams
        3. The Gospel states that Joseph was warned by an angel
who appeared to him in a dream and told him to flee to Egypt
with the child. (Mt. 2:19-23).
        Warnings through dreams play a major role in the sacred
writings of all religions. Without guaranteeing the preciseness of all
the facts recorded, and without discussing them, the phenomenon
itself has nothing abnormal about it if one knows that the time of
sleep is when the spirit disengages itself from the bonds of matter


                                  317

                         Genesis - Chapter XV


and momentarily re-enters the spirit life, where it finds itself
amongst those whom it used to know. It is often at such times
that protector spirits choose to manifest themselves to their wards
and give them more direct counsels. The authenticated examples
of warnings through dreams are numerous, but one must not
infer from this that all dreams are warnings, and even less that
everything seen in a dream has some special meaning. The art of
interpreting dreams should be ranked among the superstitious and
absurd beliefs. (See chap. XIV, nos. 27 and 28)

                   The Star of the Magi
        4. It is said that a star appeared to the magi who came to
worship Jesus, that it had gone before them pointing the way and
that it stopped when they arrived (Mt. 2:1-12).
        Since there is no means of verification, the issue does not
involve knowing whether the event narrated by Matthew is real
or if it is only an image indicating that the magi were guided
in a mysterious way to the place where the child was; rather, it
involves knowing if an event of this nature is actually possible.
        What is certain is that in this instance the light could not
have been a star. Such could have been believed at the time because
it was thought that the stars were luminous points attached to
the firmament and that they could fall to earth; but nowadays we
know their true nature.
        Even though the event did not have the cause attributed to
it, the occurrence of the apparition of light that looked like a star is
nonetheless something possible. A spirit can appear in a luminous
form or can transform part of its perispiritual fluid into a luminous
point. Many recent and perfectly authenticated occurrences of this
kind have no other cause, and such cause has nothing supernatural
about it. (See chap. XIV, nos. 13 ff.)

                      The Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem
            5. When they had come close to Jerusalem and had arrived in Bethany,
            near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead, and he
            said to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and arriving there you
            will find a donkey tied up and her foal with her. Untie her and bring
            them to me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord has
            need of them, and he will immediately allow you to take them.” Now,
            all of this took place so that this word of the prophet could be fulfilled:
            “Say to the daughter of Zion: Behold your king, who comes to you full of
            tenderness, mounted on a donkey, and upon a foal of her that is under the
            yoke.” (Zach. 9:9,10)

            The disciples then went and did what Jesus had ordered. And having brought
            the donkey and her foal, they covered them with their garments and had him
            mount them. (Mt. 21:1-7)137

            6. Rise, let us go, for he who must betray me is at hand.” He had no sooner
            finished these words, when Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him
            a troop of men armed with swords and clubs, and who had been sent by
            the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now, he who would betray
            him had given them a signal in order to recognize him, saying to them,
            “The one whom I kiss, he is the one you seek; seize him.” Then he quickly
            approached Jesus and said to him, “Master, I greet you,” and he kissed
            him. Jesus answered him, “My friend, what have you come here to do?”
            At that moment, all the others came forward, seized Jesus and arrested
            him. (Mt. 26:46-50)

                          Miraculous Fishing
      7. One day when Jesus was on the bank of Lake Gennesaret, finding himself
      pressed by the crowd of people huddled together to hear the word of God, he
      saw two boats moored at the edge of the lake; the fishermen had gotten out of
      them and were washing their nets. He then got into one of the boats, which
      was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little ways from the land. And
      having sat down, he taught the people from atop the boat.

      When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Go out into deep water
      and cast your nets in order to fish.” Simon answered, “Master, we have worked
      all night without catching anything, but because you say so I will cast the net.”
      Having cast it, they caught such a large quantity of fish that the net tore. They
      waved to their companions in the other boat to come and help them. They came
      and filled up their boats so much that they nearly began to sink. (Lk: 5:1-7)

                 The Calling of Peter, Andrew,
                  James, John and Matthew
      8. Now, Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee and saw two
      brothers – Simon, called Peter, and Andrew, his brother – who were casting their
      nets into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me and I
      will make you fishers of men.” They immediately left their nets and followed him.

      Continuing on from there, he saw two more brothers – James, son of Zebedee,
      and John, his brother – who were in a boat with Zebedee, their father,
      mending their nets, and he called to them. They immediately left their nets
      and father and followed him. (Mt. 4:18-22)

      Upon leaving there, Jesus saw a man, who was called Matthew, seated in the
      tax collectors office, and said to him, “Follow me,” and he immediately rose
      and followed him. (Mt. 4:9)

      9. These events contain nothing surprising when one knows
about the power of second sight and the very natural cause behind


                                        320

                        Miracles in the Gospel


this faculty. Jesus possessed it to a high degree, and one could say
that it was his normal state, to which a large number of acts during
his life attest, and which today have been explained by magnetic
phenomena and Spiritism.
       The fishing incident, regarded as miraculous, may also be
explained by second sight. Jesus did not spontaneously produce
fish where there were none; rather, he saw, as could someone
lucidly alert, by means of soul sight, the place where the fish were
and could confidently tell the fishermen to cast their nets there.
       Perception of thought and, consequently, certain predictions,
are the result of spirit sight. When Jesus called Peter, Andrew,
James, John and Matthew, he would have to have known their
inner dispositions in order to know that they would follow him and
that they were capable of carrying out the mission that he would
entrust to them. It would be necessary for them too to have had
an intuition about such mission in order to hand themselves over
to him. The same occurred on the day of the Last Supper, when he
stated that one of the twelve would betray him, and pointed him
out by saying that it would be the one who put his hand into the
dish; and also when he said that Peter would deny him.
       In many passages in the Gospel it says: “But Jesus, knowing
their thought, said to them…” Now, how could he know their
thought if it were not by means of the fluidic radiation of those
thoughts and at the same time by means of the spirit sight that
enabled him to read individuals’ innermost dispositions?
       Thus, quite often, when we believe that a thought is deeply
hidden in the folds of our soul, we do not suspect that we carry
within us a mirror that reflects it, a revelator in its own fluidic
radiation impregnated by it. If we were to see the mechanism of the
invisible world that surrounds us, the diffusion of the conductor
wires of thought that connect all corporeal and incorporeal
intelligent beings, the fluidic emanations charged with imprints of

the mental world and which, like aerial currents, crisscross space,
we would be less surprised by certain effects that ignorance has
attributed to chance. (See chap. XIV, nos. 15, 22 ff.)

      years, who had suffered much at the hands of several physicians, and who,
      having spent all her assets without having received any relief but had only
      gotten worse, having heard about Jesus, came up from behind the crowd
      and touched his garments, for she said to herself, “If I could only touch his
      garments, I would be healed.” At that instant, the source of the blood she was
      losing dried up and she felt within her body that she was healed of the illness.

      At the same instant, Jesus felt that power had gone out of him, and he turned
      to the crowd and asked, “Who touched my garments?” His disciples said to
      him, “You can see that the crowd is pressing in on you from all sides and
      you ask who touched you?” But he was looking all around to see who had
      touched him.

      However, the woman, who knew what had happened to her, trembled with
      fear and came to throw herself at his feet and told him the whole truth.
      Jesus said to her, “My daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace and be
      healed of your illness.” (Mk. 5:25-34)

       11. Those words, “feeling that power had gone out of him”
are significant. They express the fluidic movement that had gone
from Jesus to the infirm woman. Both felt the action that had just
been produced. It is noteworthy that the effect was not caused by
any act of Jesus’ own will; neither magnetization nor laying on of
hands had occurred. A normal fluidic radiation was enough to
work the healing.

                                       322

                            Miracles in the Gospel


       But why was that radiation directed toward this woman
rather than toward the others, since Jesus was not thinking about
her and since he was surrounded by the crowd?
       The reason is quite simple. Given as therapeutic matter, the
fluid must reach the organic disorder in order to repair it. It can be
directed toward the illness by the healer’s will or it can be attracted
by the ardent desire, the trust – in other words, the faith – of
the ill person. With respect to the fluidic current, the former acts
like a force pump, whereas the latter acts like a suction pump.
Sometimes, it is necessary for both actions to occur simultaneously,
while at other times one is enough. The latter is what took place
in this situation.
       Jesus was right in saying, “Your faith has saved you.” One
should understand that faith here is not some mystical virtue as
certain people understand it, but a truly attracting power; those
who do not possess it oppose the fluidic current with a repelling
force, or at least the force of inertia, which paralyzes the action.
From this, one can understand that, of two individuals suffering
from the same infirmity, when in the presence of a healer, one may
be healed but not the other. This is one of the most important
principles of healing mediumship and it uses a very natural cause
to explain certain apparent anomalies. (See chap. XIV, nos. 31-33)
                  The Blind Man of Bethsaida
      12. Having reached Bethsaida, they brought him a blind man who asked
      him to touch him.

      Taking the blind man by the hand, he led him outside of the village. He
      put saliva on his eyes, and laying his hands on him, asked him if he could
      see anything. The man looked around and said to him, “I see men walking
      around that look to me like trees.” Jesus placed his hands upon the man’s eyes
      once more and he began to see better. Finally, he was healed in such a way
      that he saw everything distinctly.


                                      323

                             Genesis - Chapter XV


      Then, Jesus sent him home, saying to him, “Go home; and if you enter the
      village do not tell anyone what has happened to you.” (Mk. 8:22-26)

      13. Here, the magnetic effect is obvious. The healing was
not instantaneous but gradual, the result of a firm and repeated
action, although more rapid than in ordinary magnetism. The first
sensation of the man was precisely what blind persons experience
when they recover their sight. Because of an optical effect, objects
seem to have an exaggerated size.
                               The Paralytic
      14. Having gotten into a boat, Jesus crossed the lake and came to his own
      town (Capernaum). And when he was presented with a paralytic lying on a
      cot, Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “My son, take heart; your
      sins are forgiven.”

      Immediately, some of the scribes said to one another, “This man blasphemes.”
      But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, asked them, “Why do you
      harbor evil thoughts in your hearts? Which is easier to say: Your sins are
      forgiven, or to say: Get up and walk? Now, so that you may know that the
      Son of Man has the power to forgive sins on earth, Get up” – he said to the
      paralytic – “take your cot and go home.”

      The paralytic immediately got up and went home. And upon seeing the
      miracle, the people were filled with fear and gave glory to God for having
      given such power to men. (Mt. 9:1-8)

        15. What could be the meaning of these words: “Your sins
are forgiven,” and in what way could they be used for healing?
Spiritism provides the key to this, just as it does to an infinite
number of other words misunderstood until now. By means of
the law of the plurality of existences, it teaches us that the ills and
afflictions of life are often expiations of the past and that we suffer
in the present life the consequences of wrongs we committed in

                                       324

                             Miracles in the Gospel


a previous one – the different lives being in solidarity with one
another until we have paid the debt for their imperfections.
       Therefore, if the infirmity of this man was a punishment
for the evil he might have committed, by saying to him, “Your
sins are forgiven,” Jesus was saying to him, “You have paid your
debt; the cause of your infirmity is erased by your present faith.
Consequently, you deserve to be free of your infirmity.” That is
why he said to the scribes, “Which is easier to say: Your sins are
forgiven, or to say: Get up and walk?” Once the cause ceases, the
effect must cease. The case is the same as for a prisoner to whom
one has come to say, “Your crime has been expiated and pardoned,”
which would be the same as saying, “You can leave prison.”
                            The Ten Lepers
      16. One day, as he was going toward Jerusalem, he passed by the outskirts of
      Samaria and Galilee. And as he was about to enter a village, ten lepers came
      before him; and keeping their distance, they raised their voices, saying to him
      “Jesus, our Lord, have mercy on us.” When he saw them, Jesus said to them,
      “Go show yourselves to the priests.” And as they were going, they were healed.

      Seeing that he was healed, one of them retraced his steps, praising God in a
      loud voice. And he came and threw himself at Jesus’ feet with his face pressed
      to the ground, giving thanks to him; and this one was a Samaritan.

      Jesus then asked him, “Were not all ten healed? Where, then, are the other
      nine? None have returned to give glory to God except this foreigner.” And he
      said to him, “Get up, go; your faith has saved you.” (Lk. 17:11-19)

      17. The Samaritans were schismatics – more or less like
Protestants with respect to Catholics – and despised by the Jews
as heretics. By indiscriminately healing Samaritans and Jews, Jesus
was giving both a lesson on tolerance and an example of it; and
by emphasizing the fact that only the Samaritan had returned to


                                       325

                            Genesis - Chapter XV


give glory to God, he was showing that he had more real faith
and recognition than those who regarded themselves as orthodox.
By adding, “Your faith has saved you,” he was showing that God
looks into the depths of the heart and not at the outward form of
worship. Even so, he healed the others; he did so for the lesson he
wanted to give, and also to demonstrate their ingratitude. But who
knows what resulted from this, and what benefit they attained
from the grace they were granted? By saying to the Samaritan,
“Your faith has saved you,” Jesus implies that the same was not the
case with the others.
                        The Withered Hand
      18. At another time, Jesus entered the synagogue, where he found a man
      who had a withered hand. And they watched Jesus to see if he would heal on
      the Sabbath so that they would have a reason to accuse him. He said to the
      man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand there in their midst.”
      Then, he asked them, “On the Sabbath, is it permissible to do good or evil,
      to save life or take it?” They remained silent. However, looking at them with
      indignation, he pitied them for the blindness of their hearts, and said to
      the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and it became whole.

      Immediately, the Pharisees left and held counsel with the Herodians against
      him as to how to cause his downfall. However, Jesus withdrew with his
      disciples to the sea, to where a large crowd of people had followed him from
      Galilee and Judea, from Jerusalem, Idumea and from beyond the Jordan. And
      having heard about the things he was doing, those from the area surrounding
      Tyre and Sidon came in large numbers to meet him. (Mk. 3:1-8).

                        The Stooped Woman
      19. Jesus taught in a synagogue every Sabbath. One day, he saw a woman
      possessed by a spirit who had made her infirm for eighteen years; and she
      was so stooped over that she could not look up at all. Upon seeing her, Jesus


                                      326

                            Miracles in the Gospel


      called to her and said, “Woman, you are free of your infirmity.” At the same
      time, he placed his hands on her; and she immediately straightened up and
      gave thanks to God.

      But the head of the synagogue was indignant because Jesus had healed on
      a Sabbath, and he said to the people, “There are six days meant for work.
      Come here on one of those days to be healed and not on one of the Sabbaths.”

      The Lord then said to him, “Hypocrite, which one of you does not untie his
      ox or donkey from the manger on the Sabbath to lead it to drink? So why
      should this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen
      years, not be freed on the Sabbath from her bonds?”

      At these words, all his adversaries became confused and all the people were
      thrilled at seeing him do such glorious things. (Lk. 13:10-17)

      20. This incident shows that at that time most infirmities
were attributed to a demon, and that, as today, possessions were
confused with illnesses, but in a reverse sense; that is, nowadays
those who do not believe in evil spirits confuse obsessions with
pathological illnesses.
                    The Paralytic by the Pool
      21. Afterward, the celebration of the Jews having arrived, Jesus went
      to Jerusalem. Now, in Jerusalem was the Sheep Pool, called Bethesda in
      Hebrew, which had five colonnades, where a large number of infirm, blind
      and lame persons and others with withered limbs lay; all were waiting for
      the waters to become agitated, for at a certain time the angel of the Lord
      would descend to the pool and stir up the water; and whoever entered first
      after the water was stirred up was healed of whatever infirmity he had.

      Now, there was a man there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
      Upon seeing him lying there, and knowing that he had been an invalid for
      such a long time, Jesus asked him, “Do you want to be healed?” The invalid
      answered, “Sir, I do not have anyone to throw me into the pool after the


                                      327

                            Genesis - Chapter XV


      water is stirred up, and by the time it takes me to get there, someone else
      gets in ahead of me.” Jesus said to him, “Get up, take your mat and walk.”
      Immediately, the man was healed; and taking his mat, he began to walk.
      Now, it was a Sabbath day.

      The Jews thus said to the one who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath;
      you are not allowed to carry your mat.” The man responded, “The one who
      healed me said, ‘Take your mat and walk.’” They asked him, “Where is this
      man who told you, ‘Take your mat and walk?’ But the one who had been
      healed did not know, because Jesus had withdrawn from the crowd.

      Afterward, Jesus found the man in the Temple and said to him, “You can
      see that you are healed; do not sin in the future or else something worse may
      happen to you.”

      The man went to find the Jews and told them that it was Jesus who had
      healed him. For that reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing
      such things on the Sabbath. Then, Jesus said to them, “My Father has not
      ceased working even now, and I too work without ceasing.” (Jn. 5:1-17)

      22. Among the Romans, it is said that pools (from the
Latin piscis, fish) were originally tanks or aquariums where fish
were raised. Later, the meaning of the word was extended to the
tanks where people bathed in common.
      The pool at Bethesda in Jerusalem was a cistern close to the
Temple and was fed by a natural spring whose water seemed to
have had healing properties. Undoubtedly, it was an intermittent
spring that at certain times forcefully gushed forth and stirred up
the water. According to common belief, that was the most favorable
moment for healings; in reality, it could have been that, at the
moment the water gushed forth, it had a more active property, or
that the agitation caused by the gushing water carried minerals
that were healthful for certain infirmities. Such effects are quite
natural and well-known nowadays, but back then, the sciences


                                      328

                             Miracles in the Gospel


were little advanced and a supernatural cause was seen behind the
majority of misunderstood phenomena. Thus, the Jews attributed
the stirring up of the water to the presence of an angel, and this
belief seemed all the more well-founded because at that moment
the water was more salutary.
       After having healed the man, Jesus said to him, “Do not sin
in the future or else something worse may happen to you.” With
these words he gave him to understand that his infirmity was a
punishment, and that if he did not improve himself, he could be
punished again even more harshly. This doctrine is in complete
conformance with what Spiritism teaches.
       23. Jesus seems to have taken the task of performing such
healings on the Sabbath in order to have the opportunity to protest
against the strictness of the Pharisees with respect to observing
that particular day. He wanted to show them that true piety
does not consist in observing outward practices and formalities;
rather, piety lies in the sentiments of the heart. He justified this
by declaring, “My Father has not ceased working even now and
I too work without ceasing.” What he meant was that God does
not quit working or acting on the things of nature on the Sabbath.
God continues to do whatever is necessary for your nourishment
and your health, and I am God’s example.
                   The Man Blind from Birth
      24. As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind since
      birth; and his disciples asked him this question, “Lord, was it the sin of this
      man or the sin of those who brought him into the world that caused him to
      be born blind?”

      Jesus responded, “It is not he who sinned, nor those who brought him into
      the world; but it is so that the works of God’s power might shine in him. It is
      necessary that I do the works of the one who has sent me while it is still day;



                                       329

                      Genesis - Chapter XV


night is coming, in which no one can work. While I am in the world, I am
the light of the world.

Having said this, he spit on the ground, and having made clay with his
saliva, he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said to him,
“Go and wash in the pool of Siloam,” which means Sent. Then he went
there, washed and returned seeing clearly.

His neighbors and those who had seen him previously begging for alms
said, “Is this not he who used to sit and beg for alms?” Some answered, “It
is him”; others said, “No, it is someone who looks like him.” But the man
said to them, “It is I.” Then, they asked him, “How were your eyes opened?”
He responded, “It was that man called Jesus; he made clay and with it he
anointed my eyes, saying, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash there.’ I went
there, washed and now I see.” They asked him, “Where is he?” He answered,
“I do not know.”

Then, they took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. Now, it was
on a Sabbath that Jesus had made the clay and opened his eyes.

The Pharisees also questioned him in order to find out how he had recovered
his sight. He said to them, “He put clay on my eyes; I washed and now I can
see,” to which some of the Pharisees said, “That man has not been sent from
God, since he does not keep the Sabbath.” Others, however, said, “How could
an evil man perform such wonders?” Hence, there was dissention among them.

They again asked the blind man, “And you, what do you say about the man
who opened your eyes?” He responded, “I would say that he is a prophet.”
But the Jews did not believe that the man had been blind and that he had
received his sight until his father and mother came, whom they questioned
saying, “Is that your son whom you say has been blind from birth? How,
then, can he see now?” His father and mother answered, “We know that he
is our son and that he has been blind from birth; but we do not know how
he can see now, and we do not know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of
age and can answer for himself.”



                                330

                            Miracles in the Gospel


      His father and mother spoke like this because they were afraid of the Jews,
      for the Jews had resolved together that whoever acknowledged Jesus as being
      the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue. This is what motivated the
      father and mother to respond, “He is of age; ask him.”

      Once more they called the man who had been blind and told him, “Render
      glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” He responded, “Whether
      or not he is a sinner, I know nothing about that. All I do know is that I
      was blind but now I can see.” They asked him again, “What did he do to
      you and how did he open your eyes?” He answered, “I have already told you
      and you heard; why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become
      his disciples?” At that, they hurled insults at him and said, “You can be his
      disciple; as for us, we are disciples of Moses. We know that God spoke to
      Moses, but as for this man, we do not even know where he came from.”

      The man responded, “It is really surprising that you do not know where he
      came from and that he opened my eyes. Now, we know that God does not
      listen to sinners; but if anyone honors him and does his will, he listens to
      him. Ever since the world has existed, no one has ever heard it said that
      someone has opened the eyes of a man blind from birth. If this man had not
      been sent by God, he could not do all the things that he has done.”

      The Pharisees said to him, “You have been nothing but a sinner from your
      mother’s womb, and you want to teach us?” And they threw him out. (Jn.
      9:1-34)

       25. This narrative, so simple and naïve, bears within
it an obvious character of truth. There is nothing fantastic or
extraordinary about it. It is a scene from real life taken from a fact.
The language of the blind man is precisely that of simple folk in
whom knowledge is supplanted by common sense, and who respond
to the arguments of their adversaries with straightforwardness, and
for reasons that lack neither justice nor appropriateness. Is not the
tone of the Pharisees that of the proud, who believe in nothing


                                      331

                         Genesis - Chapter XV


above their own intelligence, and who become indignant at the
sole idea that a man of the people could show them a thing or
two? Except for the local character of the situation, the same could
apply to our times as well.
       Being thrown out of the synagogue was like being put out of
the Church. It was a kind of excommunication. Spiritists, whose
doctrine is that of Christ interpreted according to the progress of
today’s knowledge, are treated like the Jews who acknowledged
Jesus as the Messiah. In being excommunicated, they are set
outside the Church; it is just like what the scribes and Pharisees
did to the followers of Christ. Thus, here is a man who is thrown
out because he cannot believe that the one who has healed him
is possessed by a demon, and because he glorifies God for having
been healed! Is that not what is done in regards to Spiritists?
Whatever they obtain, whether wise counsels from spirits, a return
to God and to goodness, or healings – all this is the work of the
Devil and an anathema is published against them. Have we not
seen priests declare from atop the pulpit that it would be better to
remain a disbeliever than to return to faith through Spiritism? Has
it not been said to the infirm that they must not be healed by
spirits who possess this gift because it is Satanic? Or others who
preach that the needy should not accept the bread distributed by
Spiritists because it is the bread of the Devil? Besides, what else
did the Jewish priests and Pharisees say and do? What is more, it
has been stated that everything today must happen as it did in the
time of Christ.
       The disciples’ question: Was it the sin of this man that caused
him to be blind from birth? indicates an intuition about a previous
existence; otherwise, it would not make sense, because a sin that
would cause an infirmity from birth would have had to have been
committed before birth, and therefore in a previous existence. If
Jesus had seen it as being a wrong idea, he would have said, “How


                                 332

                            Miracles in the Gospel


could this man have sinned before being born?” Instead, he said
that the man was blind, not because he had sinned, but so that
God’s power could shine on him; that is, that he would be the
instrument for a manifestation of God’s power. If his blindness
was not an expiation of the past, it was a trial that would serve
for his advancement, because God, who is just, would not have
imposed suffering without compensation.
       As for the means employed to heal him, it is obvious that
the kind of clay made from saliva and dirt could not have had any
power except through the action of the healing fluid with which
it was imbued. Thus it is that the most insignificant substances, –
water, for example – may acquire powerful and effective qualities
under the action of the spiritual or magnetic fluid, for which they
serve as a vehicle, or if you prefer, a reservoir.
                     Several Healings by Jesus
      26. Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in the synagogues,
      preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and healing all weaknesses and infirmities
      among the people. And since his reputation was spreading throughout Syria,
      all those who were infirm and diversely afflicted with pains and ills, the
      possessed, the insane and paralytics, were presented to him and he healed
      them. And a large crowd of people followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis,
      Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan. (Mt. 4:23-25)

       27. Of all the events that bear witness to Jesus’ power, the
most numerous are undoubtedly the healings. Through them
he wanted to show that true power is that which does good and
that his objective was to make himself useful – not to satisfy the
curiosity of the indifferent with extraordinary things.
       By alleviating suffering, he connected with people through
their heart and made more numerous and more sincere proselytes
than if they had been impressed only by visual spectacles. In this way


                                      333

                         Genesis - Chapter XV


he made himself loved, whereas if he had limited himself to producing
impressive physical effects, as the Pharisees asked of him, most people
would have seen him only as a sorcerer or a skillful magician, whom
the idle would have gone to see in order to be entertained.
       Thus, when John the Baptist sent his disciples to ask him if
he was the Christ, he did not say, “Yes, I am,” because any imposter
could have said that. He did not speak of wonders or extraordinary
things, but answered them simply, “Go tell John that the blind
see, the infirm are healed, the deaf hear and the Gospel is being
proclaimed to the poor.” This was telling them, “Recognize me by
my works; judge the tree by its fruit,” because that was the true
character of his divine mission.
       28. It is also by means of the good it does that Spiritism
proves its providential mission. It heals physical ills, but heals moral
infirmities especially, and therein lie the greatest wonders through
which it affirms itself. Its most sincere adherents are not those who
have been impressed by the sight of extraordinary phenomena,
but those who have been touched in their souls by its consolation;
those who have been freed from the torments of doubt; those
whose courage has been revealed in affliction, who have gained
strength in the certainty of the future that it has brought them, the
knowledge of their spiritual being and their destiny. These are the
ones whose faith is unshakable, because they feel and comprehend.
       Those who see in Spiritism only physical effects cannot
comprehend its moral power, neither can disbelievers who know
Spiritism only by the phenomena whose primary cause they do not
accept, and who see in Spiritists nothing more than sleight-of-hand
artists and charlatans. Hence, it will not be through wonders that
Spiritism will triumph over disbelief; instead, it will be through the
increase of its moral benefits, because even if disbelievers do not
believe in the wonders, they, like everyone else, do know suffering
and affliction, and no one turns down relief and consolation.

29. Next they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath, Jesus entered the
synagogue and began to teach them. They marveled at his doctrine because
he was teaching them as one having authority and not as the scribes.

Now, in the synagogue there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit, who
was exclaiming, “What is there between you and us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have
you come to destroy us? I know who you are: you are the Holy One of God.”
Jesus, however, said to him threateningly, “Be quiet and come out of that
man.” Then, the unclean spirit threw the man into violent convulsions, let
out a loud scream and came out of him.

All were so surprised by this that they asked one another, “What is this? What
is this new doctrine? He orders with authority; even unclean spirits obey
him. (Mk. 1:21-27)

30. After they had left, they presented him with a mute man possessed by a
demon. The demon having been cast out, the mute man spoke and the people
were filled with wonder, saying, “We have never seen such a thing in Israel.”

But the Pharisees were saying otherwise: “It is by the prince of demons that
he casts out demons.” (Mt. 9:32-34)

31. When he came to where his other disciples were, he saw a large crowd
of people around them, and several scribes were arguing with them. Upon
seeing Jesus, all the people were immediately taken by surprise and fear; they
ran to greet him.

Then he asked, “What are you arguing about?” And a man in the midst of
the people said, “Master, I have brought you my son who is possessed with a
mute spirit, and whenever it seizes him it throws him to the ground, and the
boy foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your
disciples to cast it out but they could not.”




                                335

                       Genesis - Chapter XV


Jesus answered them, “O disbelieving people, how long will I be with you?
How long must I endure you? Bring him to me.” They brought him and as
soon as he saw Jesus, the spirit began to shake him violently. He fell to the
ground, where he rolled around foaming at the mouth.

Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been happening?” “Since
infancy,” said the father, “and the spirit sometimes casts him into the fire and
sometimes into the water in order to kill him. If you can do something, have
compassion and help us.”

Jesus responded, “If you can believe, all things are possible for him who
believes.” Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed to him in tears, “Lord, I
believe; help me in my disbelief.”

And seeing that a crowd was coming nearer, Jesus spoke threateningly to the
unclean spirit, saying, “You deaf and mute spirit, I order you to come out of
the boy and not to enter him again.” Then the spirit, having let out a loud
cry and having shaken him with violent convulsions, came out, and the boy
remained as if dead, and many said that he was dead. But after Jesus took
him by the hand and lifted him up, he stood up.

While Jesus was going home, his disciples asked him in private, “Why could
we not cast the demon out?” He answered, “That kind of demon can be cast
out only through prayer and fasting.” (Mk. 9:13-28)

32. Then, they presented him with a possessed man who was also blind and
mute, and he healed him so that he began to talk and see. All the people were
filled with wonder at this and asked, “Is this not the son of David?”

But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man casts out demons
only by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.”

Now Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided
against itself will be ruined and every city or house divided against itself
cannot stand. If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself.
Therefore, how will his kingdom stand? And if it is by Beelzebub that I cast

                            Miracles in the Gospel


      out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Thus, they themselves shall
      be your judges. But If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, the kingdom of
      God has thus come to you.” (Mt. 12:22-28)

       33. Along with the healings, the liberating of the possessed
figure among the most numerous acts of Jesus. Among the events
of this nature, there are those, like the one narrated above in no.
30, where possession is not patent. It is probable that at that
time, as is still the case nowadays, the influence of demons was
attributed to all infirmities whose cause was unknown, especially
muteness, epilepsy and catalepsy. There are others, however, in
which the action of evil spirits cannot be doubted; they have such
a striking similarity to those that we witness that we recognize in
them all the symptoms of that type of ailment. The proof of the
participation of a hidden intelligence in such a case stands out
from a material fact: many radical healings have been obtained in
some Spiritist centers solely by means of evoking and moralizing
obsessor spirits, without magnetization or medication, and
frequently with the patient absent and far away. Christ’s immense
ascendancy gave him such authority over imperfect spirits – at
the time called demons – that all he had to do was order them to
come out in such a way that they could not resist his command.
(See chap. XIV, no. 46)
        34. The incident where the evil spirits were sent into the
bodies of pigs is contrary to all possibility. Moreover, it would
be difficult to explain the presence of such a large herd of pigs
in a country where these animals were regarded with disgust and
offered no usefulness as food. An evil spirit is nonetheless a human
spirit, although so imperfect that it continues to do evil after death
just as it did before, and it is against the laws of nature for it to be
able to live in the body of an animal. Hence, one must see here one
of those exaggerations that were so common in times of ignorance


                                      337

                                  Genesis - Chapter XV


and superstition; or perhaps an allegory meant to characterize the
unclean tendencies of certain spirits.
       35. Obsessed and possessed individuals seem to have been
quite numerous in Judea at the time of Jesus, which provided
him an opportunity to heal many. Undoubtedly, evil spirits had
invaded that country and caused an epidemic of possessions. (See
chap. XIV, no. 49)
       Although not an epidemic, individual obsessions are
extremely frequent and appear under the most varied aspects, a
fact that may be recognized through an in-depth understanding of
Spiritism. They can often have deplorable consequences for one’s
health, whether by aggravating organic afflictions or by causing
them. Incontestably, they will someday be classified among the
pathological causes that require special curative measures due to
their special nature. By revealing the true cause of the malady,
Spiritism opens up a new path to the art of healing, and furnishes
science a way to be successful where it fails frequently only because
it does not attack the primary cause of the malady. (See The
Mediums’ Book, chap. XXIII)
         36. Jesus was accused by the Pharisees of being assisted by
demons in casting out demons. According to them, the good that
Jesus was doing was the work of Satan. They did not reflect on
the fact that if Satan cast himself out, he would be committing
a nonsensical act. It is worth noting that the Pharisees at that
time held that every reputedly transcendent – and for that reason,
supernatural – faculty was the work of the Devil; thus, in their
opinion Jesus himself had received his power from him. This is
one more point of similarity with nowadays, and such a doctrine
is still that of the Church, which today tries to prevail against spirit
manifestations.138

      Not all theologians profess such absolute opinions concerning the demoniac doctrine.

                               Jairus’ Daughter
      37. Jesus again crossed over by boat to the other side, and a large crowd
      gathered around him as soon as he was close to the sea. And a head of the
      synagogue, named Jairus, came looking for him, and finding him he threw
      himself at his feet, begging vehemently, saying, “I have a daughter who is about
      to die; come and put you hands on her in order to heal her and save her life.”

      Jesus went there with him, followed by a large crowd who pressed around him….

      While Jesus was still speaking, some of the head of the synagogue’s house came
      and said to him, “Your daughter is dead; why do you want to put the Master
      to the trouble of going any further?” Upon hearing this, however, Jesus said to
      the head of the synagogue, “Do not be troubled; only believe.” And he allowed
      no one to accompany him except Peter, James and John, James’ brother.

      Having arrived at the home of the head of the synagogue, he saw a distraught
      group of people who were crying and wailing. Entering the home, he said to
      them, “Why are you making so much noise and why are you crying? The girl
      is not dead; she is only sleeping.” They scoffed at him. Having made everyone
      leave, he took the child’s father and mother and those who had come with
      him, and he went into the place where the girl was lying. He took her hand

Here is one by an ecclesiastic, the value of which the clergy could not dispute. The following
passage may be found in the Conférences sur la religion, by Monsignor Frayssinous, Bishop
of Hermopolis, vol. II, p. 341 (Paris, 1825):
“If Jesus had performed such miracles by means of the power of the Devil, it would have
worked for the destruction of his authority and would have employed his own power
against him. Obviously, a Devil who sought to destroy the kingdom of vice in order to
establish the kingdom of virtue would be a strange Devil. That is why Jesus, in order to rebuff
the absurd accusation of the Jews, said to them, “If I perform wonders in the name of the
Devil, then the Devil is divided against himself and seeks to destroy himself!” – a response
that needs no reply.
This is precisely the argument that Spiritists use to oppose those who attribute to the
Devil the good counsels they receive from spirits. The Devil would be like a professional
thief who returned everything he had stolen and exhorted other thieves to become
honest individuals – Auth.

            and said, “Talitha cumi,” that is, “My child, I order you to get up.” At that
            instant the girl got up and began walking. She was twelve years old and they
            were marvelously astonished. (Mk. 5:21-24, 35-43)

                      The Son of the Widow from Nain
            38. The next day, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples
            accompanied him with a large crowd of people. When he was close to the
            city’s gate, a dead person was being readied for burial. He was the only son of
            his mother, who was a widow; and a large number of people from the town
            were with her. When he saw her, the Lord was touched with compassion
            and said to her, “Weep no more.” Then, approaching the coffin, he touched
            it, and those who were carrying it stopped. Then Jesus said, “Young man,
            I order you to get up.” Immediately, he who was dead sat up and began to
            speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

            All those present were taken with fear and glorified God saying, “A great prophet
            has appeared in our midst and God has visited his people.” Word of this miracle
            spread throughout Judea and all the neighboring regions. (Lk. 7:11-17)

       39. The occurrence of the return to corporeal life by a truly dead
individual would be contrary to the laws of nature and, consequently,
miraculous. However, it is not necessary to resort to that order of
phenomena to explain the resurrections performed by Christ.
       If appearances sometimes deceive even professionals
nowadays, instances of this sort must have been much more
frequent in a country where no precautions were taken and where
burial was immediate.139 Thus, there is all probability that in the
two cases cited above there was only syncope or lethargy involved.

139
      Proof of this custom may be found in Acts 5:5 ff.: “When Ananias heard these words, he fell over
      and gave up his spirit; and all who heard about it were taken with great fear. Immediately, some
      young men came to get his body, and after wrapping it, they buried it. Around three hours later,
      his wife (Sapphira), who did not know what had happened, came in. And Peter said to her….
      [etc.] At that very moment she fell at his feet and gave up her spirit. The young men entered,
      found her dead; and wrapping her, they buried her together with her husband.” – Auth.

Jesus himself obviously said this about Jairus’ daughter: “The girl is
not dead but is only asleep.”
       As a consequence of the fluidic power that Jesus possessed,
there is nothing surprising that this vivifying fluid, directed by a
powerful will, had reanimated numbed senses; that he had even
been able to call back to the body – as long as the perispiritual tie
was not definitely broken – the spirit that was ready to abandon it.
For people at that time, who believed a person was dead as soon as
the breath stopped, there was a resurrection, and they could affirm
it in good faith; however, in reality there was a healing and not a
resurrection in the true meaning of the word.
       40. No matter what may be said, the resurrection of Lazarus
in no way invalidates this principle. It is stated that he had been
in the tomb for four days; however, it is well known that there
are lethargies that last eight days or more. One might add that
Lazarus already smelled bad, which is a sign of decomposition.
This allegation also proves nothing, keeping in mind that in
certain individuals there is partial decomposition of the body even
before death, and they give off a rotten smell. Death arrives only
when the organs essential to life are stricken.
       And who could affirm that Lazarus in fact smelled rotten?
It is his sister Martha who says so, but did she know it for a fact?
Lazarus had been buried for four days, so she assumed it, but there
was no way she could have been certain. (See chap. XIV, no. 29)140

140
      The following incident proves that decomposition sometimes precedes death. In the
      Convent of the Good Shepherd, founded in Toulon by penal colony chaplain Abbot Marin
      for repentant women, there was a girl who had borne the most horrible sufferings with
      the composure and impassiveness of an expiatory victim. In the midst of her pain, she
      seemed to smile as if she were having a heavenly vision. Like St. Teresa, she asked to suffer
      even more, her flesh in tatters and gangrene destroying her limbs. Out of wise foresight,
      the doctors had recommended that they inter the body right after death. How strange!
      As soon as she let out her last breath, the whole process of decomposition stopped, the
      cadaverous exhalations ceased and for thirty-six hours she remained exposed to the
      prayers and veneration of the community – Auth.

                           Jesus Walks on Water
            41. Immediately, Jesus had his disciples get into a boat to go to the other
            side ahead of him while he sent away the multitudes. After having sent them
            away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray, and since evening had
            fallen, he found himself alone there.

            Meanwhile, the boat was being buffeted by the waves in the middle of the
            sea, because the wind was against it. Nevertheless, during the fourth watch
            of the evening, Jesus came to them walking on the sea.141 When they saw him
            walking on the sea, they became confused and said, “It is a ghost,” and they
            cried out in fear. Immediately, Jesus then said to them, “Peace be with you;
            it is I; do not be afraid.”

            Peter responded, “Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you walking on
            the water.” Jesus said to him, “Come.” And Peter got out of the boat and
            walked on the water to go to Jesus. However, a strong wind arose and he
            was afraid; and when he began to sink, he exclaimed, “Lord, save me.” Jesus
            immediately extended his hand, took hold of him and said, “O man of little
            faith, why did you doubt?” And when they had gotten back into the boat,
            the wind stopped. Then, those who were in the boat drew close to him and
            worshipped him, saying, “You are truly the son of God.” (Mt. 14:22-33)

      42. This phenomenon finds its natural explanation in the
principles set forth above in chap. XIV, no. 43.
      Similar examples demonstrate that it is neither impossible
nor miraculous since it lies within the laws of nature. It can be
produced in two ways.
      Although he was alive, Jesus could appear on the water in
tangible form while his body was elsewhere: this is the most probable
hypothesis. In the story one can even recognize certain signs that are
characteristic of tangible apparitions. (See chap. XIV, nos. 35-37).

       On the other hand, his body could possibly have been held
up and gravity neutralized by the same fluidic force that holds a
table in the air without a point of support. The same effect has
often been produced involving human bodies.

                           The Transfiguration
           43. Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James and John and led them alone with
           him to a high mountain in an isolated place142, where he was transfigured
           in front of them. And while he was praying, his face appeared completely
           different; his garments turned brilliantly luminous and as white as snow,
           such that no bleach on earth could have made them so white. And Elijah
           and Moses appeared and began conversing with Jesus.

           Then, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here; let us make three
           shelters – one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah,” for he did not know
           what he was saying, being so afraid.

           At the same time, a cloud appeared, which covered them; and from the cloud
           a voice came proclaiming these words, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.”

           Immediately upon looking around, they saw no one except Jesus, who
           remained alone with them.

           When they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them not to tell
           anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man was raised from the
           dead. And they kept these things secret, asking each other what he had meant
           by the words: Until the Son of Man was raised from the dead. (Mk. 9:1-9)

      44. It is once more in the properties of the perispiritual
fluid that the explanation of this phenomenon may be found.

phenomenon, which, as a result of fluidic radiation, can change
an individual’s appearance. However, the purity of Jesus’ perispirit
enabled his spirit to give him an exceptional brilliance. As for the
apparition of Moses and Elijah, it falls completely within the realm
of all the phenomena of the same genre. (See chap. XIV, nos. 35 ff.)
        Of all the faculties revealed in Jesus, there were none which
were outside the conditions of humanity, or which could not be
found in the most ordinary individuals, because such faculties
are part of nature. However, because of the superiority of his
moral essence and his fluidic qualities, such faculties attained
proportions in him far above those of the common folk. Apart
from his corporeal envelope, they would represent for us the state
of the pure spirits.

                   Jesus Calms the Storm
      45. One day, he was in a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let us go
      to the other side of the lake. Then, they set out. And while they were crossing,
      he fell asleep. A great windstorm suddenly struck the lake so that their boat,
      filling with water, was in danger. His disciples approached him and woke
      him up, saying, “Master, we are perishing.” Jesus got up, spoke threateningly
      to the wind and the raging waves; they subsided and there was a great calm.
      Then, he said to them, “Where is your faith?” However, they were full of fear
      and wonder and asked one another, “Who is this who orders the wind and
      waves in such a way and they obey him?” (Lk. 8:22-25)

      46. We do not yet know enough about the secrets of nature
to say whether or not there are hidden intelligences that preside
over the action of the elements. If such a hypothesis were affirmed,
the phenomenon in question could have been the result of an act
of authority over such intelligences and would demonstrate a
power that has not been given to any man or woman to exercise.

                         Miracles in the Gospel


       In any case, Jesus sleeping peacefully during the storm attests
to a confidence that may be explained by the fact that his spirit saw
that there was no danger, and that the storm would subside.

                 The Wedding at Cana
       47. This miracle, mentioned only in the Gospel of John,
is presented as being the first one Jesus performed, and as such,
it must have been one of the most noteworthy; however, it
seems to have had very small impact because none of the other
Evangelists mention it. An event so extraordinary should have
caused the highest degree of wonder among the guests, and
especially the owner of the house, but they do not seem to have
noticed it at all.
       Considered by itself, the incident has little importance
in comparison with those that truly attest to Jesus’ spiritual
qualities. Supposing that things occurred as they are narrated, it is
remarkable that this is the only phenomenon of this genre that he
produced. He was of a nature too high to become involved with
purely physical effects, suitable only to stimulate the curiosity of
the crowd, who would have likened him to a magician. He knew
that useful things would win him more sympathy and would bring
him more followers than those that could pass as sleight-of-hand
without touching the heart. (See no. 27)
       Although this incident could possibly be explained up to a
certain extent by a fluidic action, which, like the examples offered
by magnetism, would have changed the properties of the water
giving it the flavor of wine, this hypothesis is not very probable,
considering in such a case that the water, having only the taste
of wine, would have retained its color – a fact which would not
have failed to be noticed. It is more reasonable to see in this one
of those parables that are so frequent in the teachings of Jesus, like


                                  345

                        Genesis - Chapter XV


that of the prodigal son, the wedding feast, the unrighteous rich
man, the withered fig tree, and such others, which nonetheless
have the character of actual events. During the meal, he could
have made an allusion to wine and water, deriving a teaching from
both. What justifies this opinion are the words addressed by the
steward on this subject: “Every man first serves the good wine, and
after much has been drunk, inferior wine is served; as for you, you
have saved the good wine until now.”
       Between these two hypotheses, one must choose the
most rational, and Spiritists are not so gullible as to see only
manifestations everywhere, nor are they so extreme in pretending
to explain everything by fluids.

         The Multiplication of the Loaves
       48. The multiplication of the loaves is one of the miracles
that have most intrigued commentators; at the same time it has
incited the eloquence of disbelievers. Without going to the
trouble of probing its allegorical meaning, they see it as only
a childish story. However, the majority of serious persons have
seen in this narrative, although in an unusual form, a parable
comparing the spiritual nourishment of the soul with the
nourishment of the body.
       Nonetheless, one may see in it more than an allegory and,
from a certain point of view, one may accept the reality of a factual
event without having to resort to a miracle. It is known that intense
mental preoccupation or attention given to a matter can make
one forget hunger. Now, those following Jesus were individuals
eager to listen to him. Consequently, there is nothing surprising
that, fascinated by what he was saying and also, perhaps, by the
powerful magnetic action he was exerting on them, they had not
felt the physical need to eat.

                             Miracles in the Gospel


       Because he had foreseen this result, Jesus could thus put his
disciples at ease by telling them in his usual, figurative language
that the loaves – assuming there really were a few loaves – would
suffice to satiate the crowd. At the same time, he was providing
his disciples with a lesson: “You yourselves give them something
to eat,” he said. He was thus teaching them that they too could
provide nourishment by means of the word.
       In this way, besides the moral-allegorical meaning, a natural,
very common physiological effect was produced. The miracle in
this case lies in the ascendancy of Jesus’ word, which was powerful
enough to capture the attention of a huge crowd to the point
of making them forget to eat. Such moral power proves Jesus’
superiority much more than would the purely physical occurrence
of the multiplying of the loaves, which must be taken as an allegory.
       Moreover, this explanation is confirmed by Jesus himself in
the following two passages.
                    The Yeast of the Pharisees
      49. Now, his disciples, having crossed to the other side, forgot to bring bread
      along. Jesus said to them, “Take care to guard yourselves against the yeast of
      the Pharisees and Sadducees.” But they thought and said to each other, “It is
      because we did not bring any bread.”

      Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Men of little faith, why are
      you telling each other that you did not bring any bread? Do you still not
      understand and do you not remember that five loaves were enough for five
      thousand men, and how many baskets-full you collected? Why do you not
      understand that I was not talking to you about bread when I told you to
      guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees?”

      Then, they understood that he was not telling them to guard themselves
      against the yeast that is added to bread, but the doctrine of the Pharisees and
      Sadducees. (Mt. 16:5-12)

                   The Bread of Heaven
50. On the following day, the people, who had remained on the other side
of the sea, noticed that there was no other boat there, and that Jesus had not
gotten into the one with his disciples, but that only the disciples had gone. And
since other boats from Tiberiades had arrived later close to the place where
the Lord had fed them with the five loaves after giving thanks, and since they
finally realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the
boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. When they found him on the
other side of the sea, they said to him, “Lord, when did you get here?”

Jesus answered them, “Verily, verily I say to you that you have come looking
for me not because of the miracles you saw, but because I gave you bread to
eat and you were satisfied. Work not in order to have food that perishes but
food that endures to eternal life, and which the Son of Man will give to you,
because it is upon him that God the Father has placed his seal and character.”

They asked him, “What must we do to do the works of God?” Jesus replied,
“The work of God is that you believe in him whom he has sent.”

They further asked him, “Then what miracle will you perform so that in
seeing it we may believe in you? What will you do that is extraordinary? Our
ancestors ate manna in the desert, according to what is written: ‘He gave
them bread from heaven to eat.’”

Jesus responded, “Verily, verily I say to you that Moses did not give you bread from
heaven; but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven, for the
bread of God is he who has descended from heaven and gives life to the world.”

Then they said to him, “Lord, give us always of this bread.”

Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall not hunger
and he who believes in me shall never thirst. But I have already told you: you
have seen me but you have not believed.

“Verily, verily I say to you, he who believes in me has eternal life. I am the
bread of life. Your ancestors ate manna in the desert and they are dead. But


                                   348

                           Miracles in the Gospel


      here is the bread that has come down from heaven, so that whoever eats it
      shall not die” (Jn. 6:22-36, 47-50)

       51. In the first passage, Jesus, recalling the effect produced
previously, clearly means that he had not dealt with physical
loaves; otherwise, the comparison he had made with the yeast
of the Pharisees would have lacked an object: “Do you still not
understand,” he said, “and do you not remember that five loaves
were enough for five thousand men, and that seven loaves were
enough for four thousand? How is it that you do not understand
that I was not speaking to you about bread when I told you
to guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees?” This
comparison would have been meaningless in the event of a
physical multiplication. The incident was extraordinary enough
in and of itself to have struck the imagination of his disciples,
who, however, did not seem to remember it.
       This is what is emphasized no less clearly in Jesus’ discourse
on the bread of heaven, in which he tries to make the true meaning
of spiritual food understood. “Work,” he said, “not in order to
have food that perishes but food that endures to eternal life, and
which the Son of Man will give to you.” This food is his word,
which is the bread that has come down from heaven and gives life
to the world. “I am the bread of life,” he declares. “He who comes
to me shall not hunger and he who believes in me shall never thirst.”
       Such distinctions, however, were too subtle for those unrefined
natures, who could understand only tangible things. For them, the
manna that had fed the bodies of their ancestors was the true bread from
heaven: that was a miracle. Thus, if the incident of the multiplication
had occurred materially, how could these same persons, for whom it
had been produced a few days earlier, have been so little impressed
as to say to Jesus, “What miracle will you perform so that by seeing
it we may believe in you? What will you do that is extraordinary?” It


                                    349

                                     Genesis - Chapter XV


is because they understood miracles to mean the wonders that the
Pharisees asked for, that is, signs in the sky at Jesus’ orders, as if by a
magician’s wand. What Jesus did was very simple and did not depart
from the laws of nature; the healings themselves did not display a
character sufficiently strange or extraordinary. Spiritual miracles did
not hold enough substance for them.

                        The Temptation of Jesus
      52. Jesus being taken by the Devil to the pinnacle of the
Temple and then to a mountain to be tempted by him is one of
those parables that were characteristic of him, and which public
credulity has transformed into an actual event.143
       53. “Jesus was not actually taken, but only wanted to enable
men and women to understand that humans are subject to failure
and that they must always be on guard against evil inspirations,
to which their weak nature leads them to yield. Hence, the
temptation of Jesus is an allegory and one would have to be blind
to take it literally. How could you believe that the Messiah, the
Word of God incarnate, was submitted for even a short amount
of time to the suggestions of the Devil, and that, as it says in the
Gospel of Luke, the Devil left him for a while, which would imply
that he was submitted further to the Devil’s power? No. You must
better understand the teachings that have been given to you. The
Spirit of Evil could do nothing with respect to the Essence of the
Good. No one ever affirmed having seen Jesus on the mountain
or the pinnacle of the Temple; that would certainly have been an
incident worth spreading amongst all the people at the time. The
temptation was not, therefore, a material, physical act. As for the

143
      The following explanation is the textual reproduction of a spirit’s teaching concerning the
      narrative – Auth.



                                                350

moral act, could you believe that the Spirit of Darkness – who
knew Jesus’ origin and power – could say, ‘Worship me and I will
give you all the kingdoms of the earth?’ If so, the Devil would
have been unaware as to whom he was making such an offer,
which is improbable. If he did know who Jesus was, his proposals
were nonsense, because he would have known very well that they
would be rejected by the one who had come to destroy his rule
over humankind.
       “Therefore, you must understand the meaning of this
parable, because that is all that it is – like the parables of the
Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. The former shows us
the dangers that people face if they do not resist that inner
voice that clamors to them unceasingly, ‘You can be more than
you are; you can possess more than you have; you can thrive,
acquire; yield to the voice of ambition and all your desires will
be satisfied.’ It shows us the danger and the means to avoid it
by saying to such evil inspirations, ‘Be gone, Satan!’ or in other
words, ‘Be gone, temptation!’
       “The two other parables that I have mentioned show you
what may still await those who, because they are too weak to keep
the Devil away, succumb to his temptations. They show us the
mercy of the family father laying his hand on his repentant son’s
brow and lovingly granting him the forgiveness he has begged for.
They show us that the guilty, the schismatic, those rejected by their
siblings, are more valuable in the eyes of the Supreme Judge than
those who scorn them, because they practice the virtues taught by
the law of love.
       “Weigh well the teachings given in the Gospel. Know how
to distinguish between what is literal and what is figurative, and
the errors that have blinded you for so many centuries will be
erased little by little, giving way to the shining light of the truth.”
                               John the Evangelist (Bordeaux, 1862)


                                  351

                                     Genesis - Chapter XV


             Wonders Surrounding Jesus’ Death
            54. Now, from the sixth hour of the day until the ninth, the whole earth
            was covered in darkness.

            At the same time, the veil in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom;
            the earth shook; the rocks split; the graves were opened and many bodies of
            saints, who were in the sleep of death, came back to life; and leaving their
            graves after Jesus’ resurrection, they came to the holy city and were seen by
            many people. (Mt. 27:45, 51-53)

       55. It is strange that such wonders, occurring at the same
moment in which the city’s attention was fixed upon Jesus’ death –
the event of the day – went unnoticed, for no historian makes the
least reference to them. It seems impossible that an earthquake and
the whole earth covered in darkness for three hours in a country
where the sky is always perfectly clear could have gone unnoticed.
       The length of such darkness was nearly that of an eclipse of
the sun, but eclipses of that type occur only during the time of the
new moon, and Jesus’ death occurred during the full moon on the
14th day of the month of Nissan, the day of the Jewish Passover.
       The darkening of the sun could also have been caused by
sunspots, which may be observed on its surface. In such case, the
brilliance of its light is weakened noticeably, but never to the point
of causing obscurity and darkness. Admitting that a phenomenon
of this kind had actually occurred at that time, it would have had
to have had a perfectly natural cause.144
144
      On the sun’s surface, there are always certain sunspots, which follow its rotational
      movement and which have served to determine the duration of this movement. At times,
      however, these sunspots increase in number, extent and intensity, and it is then that there
      is a decrease in light and heat. This increase in the number of sunspots seems to coincide
      with certain astronomical phenomena and the relative position of certain planets, which
      determine their periodic reappearance. The length of such darkening is highly variable;
      sometimes it lasts only two or three hours, but in 535 there was one that lasted fourteen
      months – Auth.

       As for the dead who came back to life, it could be that
a few persons had seen visions or apparitions, which is not
unusual. However, since they were not aware of the cause of such
phenomena, they supposed that the figures they saw had come
from the grave.
       Distressed by the death of their Lord, Jesus’ disciples
undoubtedly connected it with a few particular events, to which
on any other occasion they would not have paid any attention.
It would have been enough for a piece of rock at that moment
to have split apart for individuals inclined to the extraordinary
to have regarded it as a wonder, and who, exaggerating the fact,
stated that the rocks had split apart.
       Jesus is great due to his works and not due to fantastic
imagery with which enthusiasm with little enlightenment believed
it necessary to surround him.

   The Apparition of Jesus after His Death
      56. Shedding tears, Mary (Magdalene), however, remained outside close to
      the tomb. And as she was weeping, she bent down to look inside the tomb
      and saw two angels dressed in white and seated in the place where Jesus’
      body had been, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her,
      “Woman, why are you weeping?” She answered, “They have taken my Lord
      and I do not know where they have put him.”

      Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she
      did not know that it was Jesus. Then, he said to her, “Woman, why are you
      weeping? Who are you looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said
      to him, “Sir, if you are the one who took him, tell me where you have put
      him and I will take him.”

      Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She immediately turned toward him and said,
      “Rabboni”; that is, My Lord. Jesus responded, “Do not touch me, for I



                                     353

                      Genesis - Chapter XV


have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and tell them
for me, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and
your God.”

Mary Magdalene then went to tell the disciples that she had seen the Lord
and that he had told her these things. (Jn. 20:11-18)

57. On that same day, two of them were going toward a town called
Emmaus, which was about sixty stadia from Jerusalem. They were talking
about everything that had happened. And while they were talking and
discussing the matter, Jesus himself came to join them and began walking
with them. But their eyes were restrained so that they could not recognize
him. He asked them, “What have you been talking about as you walk along,
and where have you come from that you are so sad?”

One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you so foreign to Jerusalem
that you do not know what has happened these last few days?” “What has
happened?” he asked. They answered, “Regarding Jesus of Nazareth, who
was a powerful prophet before God and before all the people; and about
the way in which the chief priests and our elders handed him over to be
condemned to death and crucified him. We were hoping that he was the
one who would redeem Israel, but now this is the third day after such
things occurred. It is true that certain women, of those who used to be with
us, have surprised us, for they went to his tomb before daybreak; and not
having found his body, they came back to say that angels had appeared to
them saying that he was alive. And some of us also went to the tomb and
found everything according to what the women had told them; but as for
him, they did not find him.

Then he said to them, “O foolish ones, whose hearts are slow to believe in
everything that the prophets have said! Did not the Christ have to suffer all
those things in order to enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses, and
then with all the prophets, he explained to them what all the Scriptures had
said about him.

                       Miracles in the Gospel


When they were near the town to which they were headed, he seemed as if
he were going to go farther. But they urged him to tarry, saying, “Stay with
us, for it is late and the day is already fading.” He went in with them. With
them at the table, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to them.
At that moment, their eyes were opened and they recognized him; however,
he disappeared before their eyes.

Then, they said to each other, “Is it not true that our hearts burned within
us as he was speaking with us on the road, and as he was explaining the
Scriptures to us?” And rising at that instant, they returned to Jerusalem
and saw that the eleven apostles and those who continued with them were
assembled. They said, “The Lord has truly risen and he appeared to Simon.
Then, the two also related what had happened to them on the road and how
they had recognized him when he broke the bread.

While they were talking about this, Jesus himself appeared in their midst
and said to them, “Peace be with you; it is I; do not be afraid.” However,
in the confusion and fear that gripped them, they imagined they were
seeing a spirit.

And Jesus said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do such thoughts arise
in your hearts? Look at my hands and feet and know that it is I; touch me
and remember that a spirit does not have flesh or bones as you see that I
have.” Having said this, he showed them his hands and feet.

But since they still did not believe because they were so taken with joy
and wonder, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” They
gave him a piece of baked fish and some honeycomb. He ate in front of
them, and taking the rest he gave it to them, saying, “This is what I told
you when I was still with you: that it was necessary for everything that
was written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets and the Psalms
to be fulfilled.

At the same time, he opened their minds so that they could understand the
Scriptures; and he said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it would be



                                 355

                       Genesis - Chapter XV


necessary for the Christ to suffer, and that he would rise from the dead on the
third day; and that repentance and the remission of sins would be preached
in his name to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. Now, you are witnesses
of these things. I will send you the gift of my Father, which was promised
to you; but for now, remain in the city until I have clothed you with power
from On High.” (Lk. 24:13-49)

58. However, Thomas, called Didymus, one of the twelve apostles, was not
with them when Jesus came. The other disciples said to him, “We have seen
the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands,
place my finger in the nail holes, and put my hand in the hole in his side, I
shall not believe.”

Eight days later, the disciples were in the same place and Thomas was with
them. Jesus appeared to them while the doors were closed and stood in their
midst, and said to them, “Peace be with you.”

Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and look at my hands; also
stretch out your hand and place it in my side and be no longer disbelieving,
but faithful.” Thomas responded and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
Jesus said to him, “Thomas, you believe because you have seen; blessed are
they who believe without having seen.” (Jn. 20:24-29)

59. Afterward, Jesus also showed himself again to his disciples on the shore
of the Sea of Tiberius. He showed himself in this way:

Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, Nathanael, who was from
Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples were all
together. Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him,
“We are going with you.” They got into a boat, but they did not catch any
fish that night.

When morning came, Jesus appeared on the shore, but his disciples did not
realize that it was Jesus. He said to them, “My sons, have you nothing to
eat?” They answered, “No.” He said to them, “Cast your net on the right side



                                 356

                            Miracles in the Gospel


      of the boat and you will find some.” They cast it right away and could not
      haul it in because it was so loaded with fish.

      Then, the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” And
      realizing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter put on his clothes (because he
      was naked) and jumped into the sea. The other disciples came with the boat;
      and since they were no more than two hundred cubits from the shore, they
      dragged the net full of fish. (Jn. 21:1-8)

      60. Afterward, he led them to Bethany, and having raised his hands, he
      blessed them. And having blessed them, he left and was taken up into heaven.

      As for them, after they had worshipped him, they returned to Jerusalem
      full of joy. They were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God.
      Amen. (Lk. 24:50-53).

       61. The apparitions of Jesus after his death are narrated by
the Evangelists with circumstantial details that allow for no doubt
as to their reality. What is more, the apparitions are perfectly
explained by the fluidic laws and the properties of the perispirit,
and present nothing abnormal with the phenomena of the same
genre, of which ancient and contemporary history offer numerous
examples, to the point of not even excluding tangibility. If one
would observe the circumstances that accompanied his many
apparitions, one would recognize in him at such moments all
the characteristics of a fluidic being. He appears unexpectedly
and disappears in the same way; he is seen by some but not by
others, under appearances that make him unrecognizable even to
his disciples; he shows himself in closed rooms, where a corporeal
body could not enter; even his language lacks the verve of a
corporeal being; it has a brief and succinct manner peculiar to
spirits who manifest in that way; in other words, all his attitudes
denote something that is not of the terrestrial world. Seeing him
causes both surprise and fear at the same time; his disciples cannot


                                      357

                                     Genesis - Chapter XV


speak with him with the same freedom as before; they sense that
he is no longer a man.
       Jesus, however, showed himself with his perispiritual body,
which explains why he was seen only by those whom he wanted to
see him. If he had had his corporeal body, he would have been seen
by the first one who came to him, just as when he was alive. His
disciples, being unaware of the primary cause of the phenomena
of apparitions, did not perceive their particularities, which they
probably did not notice. Since they saw Jesus and touched him, to
them this must have been his resuscitated body. (See chap. XIV,
nos. 14, 35-38)
      62. While disbelief rejects all the phenomena performed by
Jesus because they have a supernatural appearance, and, without
exception, regards them as legends, Spiritism provides a natural
explanation for most of such phenomena. It demonstrates how
they are possible, not only by means of the theory of the fluidic
laws, but by means of their identity with similar phenomena
caused by a large number of individuals under the most ordinary
circumstances. Since the phenomena are more or less in the
public domain, they prove nothing in principle concerning the
exceptional nature of Jesus.145
       63. The greatest of the miracles that Jesus performed, the
one that truly attests to how highly evolved he was, is the revolution
that his teachings have caused throughout the world in spite of the
limits of his field of action.

145
      The numerous contemporary phenomena involving healings, apparitions, possessions,
      second sight and others, which are reported in the Revue Spirite and recalled in the above
      observations, offer, even in the most detailed circumstances, such an patent analogy with
      those that the Gospel narrates that the similarity of both the effects and the causes becomes
      obvious. Hence, it must be asked why the same phenomena would have a natural cause
      today, but a supernatural one yesterday; diabolical for some, divine for others. If it were
      possible here to place them side by side, the comparison would be easier; however, the
      number and the explanations that most of them would require would not allow it. – Auth.

       Actually, Jesus – obscure, poor, born in the most humble
circumstances amongst a people with no might, nearly ignored
and without any political, artistic or literary clout – preached
for only three years. Throughout that short span of time he
was unacknowledged, slandered, treated as an imposter and
persecuted by his fellow citizens; he had to flee in order not
to be stoned to death; he was betrayed by one of his own
disciples and denied by another; he was abandoned by all of
them at the moment he fell into the hands of his enemies. He
practiced only the good, but that did not protect him from
the malevolence that turned the very services he rendered
against him. Condemned to a death reserved for criminals,
he died ignored by the world – contemporary history is silent
on this account.146 He wrote nothing; nonetheless, aided by a
few individuals who were as obscure as he was, his word was
sufficient to regenerate the world; his doctrine slew all-powerful
paganism and became the flame of civilization. Against him
was everything that makes human beings fail, which is why we
have said that the triumph of his doctrine was the greatest of
his miracles, while at the same time it proved his mission to
have been divine. If instead of social and regenerative principles
founded upon humankind’s spiritual future he had offered
posterity only a few extraordinary phenomena, perhaps today
hardly anyone would recognize his name.

               The Disappearance of Jesus’ Body
      64. The disappearance of Jesus’ body after his death has
been the object of numerous commentaries. It is attested to by
the four Evangelists based on the report of the women who went

146
      Only the Jewish historian Favius Josephus says anything about it and very little at that. – Auth.



                                                  359

to his tomb on the third day, only to find that he was not there.
Some have seen a miraculous event in this disappearance; others
attribute it to a clandestine removal.
       According to another opinion, Jesus did not have a
corporeal body at all, but only a fluidic one. Throughout his
entire life, he was only a tangible apparition; in other words, a
kind of agenerate147. His birth, death and all the physical acts of
his life were only an appearance. Thus it has been said that his
body, having returned to the fluidic state, could disappear from
the tomb and it was with this same body that he showed himself
after his death.
       Without a doubt, such a fact is not radically impossible,
according to what is known today about the properties of the
fluids. However, it would at the least be completely exceptional
and in formal opposition to the character of agenerates (see
chap. XIV, no. 36). The issue is therefore to determine if such
a hypothesis is acceptable, and whether it is confirmed or
contradicted by the facts.
       65. Jesus’ stay on the earth entails two periods: that which
precedes his death and that which follows it. In the former, from
the moment of conception to birth, everything regarding his
mother happens as it does in the normal conditions of life.148 From
his birth until his death, everything about his acts, his language
and the various circumstances of his life reveals the unequivocal
characteristics of corporeality. The psychic phenomena that occur
in him are unexpected but there is nothing abnormal about them,
since they can be explained by the properties of the perispirit, and
may be found in differing degrees among other individuals. After
his death, on the other hand, everything about him reveals a fluidic

      concern ourselves here, but which will be examined at a later time – Auth.

being. The difference between these two states is so noticeable that
they cannot be compared.
       The corporeal body has the properties inherent to matter
per se, properties that differ essentially from those of the ethereal
fluids. In matter, breakdown occurs because of the rupture of
molecular cohesion. A cutting instrument can penetrate the
physical body and divide its tissues. If the organs essential to
life are attacked, the body stops functioning and death follows,
that is, the death of the body. Since this cohesion does not exist
in fluidic bodies, life does not lie in the functioning of special
organs; disorders analogous to those of the physical body cannot
be produced. A cutting instrument or any other can penetrate
a fluidic body like a cloud of vapor without causing any sort of
lesion. That is why bodies of this kind cannot die and why fluidic
beings called agenerates cannot be killed.
       After the death of Jesus, his inert and lifeless body was
entombed like any other body and anyone could see and touch it.
After his resurrection, when he was ready to leave earth behind, he
did not die again; instead, his body rose, dissipated and vanished
without leaving a trace – obvious proof that that body was of a
different nature than the one that perished on the cross. Hence,
one must conclude that if Jesus could die it was because he had a
body of flesh.
       Due to its material properties, the corporeal body is the
seat of sensation and physical pain, which reverberate within
the sensitive center or spirit. It is not the body that suffers; it
is the spirit, which receives the counterblow from the lesions
or alterations in the organic tissues. In a body deprived of the
spirit, sensation is lacking entirely. For the same reason, the
spirit that has no physical body cannot experience suffering,
which is the result of the alteration of matter. Hence, one must
also conclude that if Jesus suffered physically – which cannot


                                 361

                                     Genesis - Chapter XV


be doubted – it was because he had a physical body of a nature
similar to everybody else’s.
       66. The strongest moral considerations must be added to
the physical events.
       If during his life Jesus existed in the state of fluidic beings,
he would have felt neither pain nor bodily needs. To suppose
such to have been the case is to take from him all the merit of
the life of privation and suffering that he chose as an example of
resignation. If everything in his life was only an appearance, all
the events of his life, his repeated statements regarding his death,
the dolorous scene in the Garden of Olives, his prayer to God to
remove the cup from his lips, his passion and death – everything
up to the last cry when he delivered up his spirit – would have
been only a vain sham of deception regarding his true nature
and meant to create a belief in the illusory sacrifice of his life,
a farce unworthy of a simple and honest man, and, for even
more reason, of such a highly evolved being. In other words,
he would have abused the good faith of his contemporaries and
all posterity. Such are the logical consequences of that theory,
consequences that are unacceptable because they morally
degrade rather than elevate him.149
       Thus, like any other man, Jesus had both a corporeal body
and a fluidic one, a fact attested to by the physical and psychic
phenomena that highlighted his life.
      67. This idea about the nature of Jesus’ body is nothing
new. In the fourth century, Apollinarius of Laodicea, head of the
Apollinarian sect, claimed that Jesus had not taken a body like
ours, but rather an impassible body that descended out of heaven

149
      Publisher’s note: In light of the communications and phenomena appearing after the
      departure of Kardec, we must conclude that it was not really a vain sham, just as there was
      no sham when Jesus, after his death, stated the words that are recorded in Luke (24:39), “It
      is I; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh or bone as you see that I do.”

into the lap of the Holy Virgin, but which was not born from
her. Thus, Jesus had not been born and had not suffered or died
except in appearance. The Apollinarians were anathematized by
the Council of Alexandria in 360, the Council of Rome in 374
and the Council of Constantinople in 381.
       The Docetists (from the Greek dokein, to appear), a prolific
sect of Gnostics that survived for the first three centuries, held the
same belief.

                                 M

                The Theory of
                Foreknowledge
       1. How is cognizance of the future possible? One can
understand foreknowledge of events that are the consequence of
things from the present state, but not those that have no relation
to the present and even less those that are attributed to chance. It is
said that future matters do not yet exist; they are still in nothingness,
so how can one know that they will happen? Nonetheless, the
examples of predictions coming true are quite numerous, from
which one must conclude that it involves a phenomenon for which
we do not yet have the key, because there is no effect without a
cause. It is this cause that we shall attempt to discover, and once
again it is Spiritism, itself the key to so many mysteries, which will
provide the key to this one, and which, moreover, will show us that
even the phenomenon of prediction is not outside natural law.
       For comparison, let us take an example from everyday
matters, which will help us to understand the principle that we are
going to develop.
      2. Let us imagine a man up on a high mountain, observing
the vast expanse of the plain. In this circumstance, the distance of
one league would seem very small, and in one glance he could easily
take in all the different features of the terrain from the beginning


                                  367

                         Genesis - Chapter XVI


to the end of the road. The traveler who is taking this road for
the first time knows that, as he sets out, he will reach the end – a
simple foreknowledge of the result of his journey. However, the
features of the terrain, the ups and downs, the rivers and forests
to cross, the precipices into which he might fall, the thieves that
might rob him, and the inns where he might spend the night – all
of this is external to him. It is the unknown, the future, because his
sight does not extend beyond the small area that surrounds him.
As for the amount of time it will take, he measures it by how long
it will take to travel the road; take away his points of reference and
the amount of time disappears. For the man watching the traveler
from the top of the mountain, all this is the present, however.
Now, let us imagine that this man goes down to the traveler and
says to him: “At such and such a moment you will meet with such
and such a matter; you will be attacked and then rescued.” He will
be predicting the future. For the traveler it is the future; for the
man on the mountain it is the present.
       3. Now, if we leave the sphere of purely physical matters,
and if through our thought we enter the realm of the spirit life,
we will see the same phenomenon occurring on a larger scale.
Dematerialized spirits are like the man on the mountain: space
and length of time do not exist for them. However, the extent and
penetration of their sight are proportional to their purification and
their level in the spirit hierarchy. In comparison to low order spirits,
they are like persons armed with powerful telescopes alongside
those who have only their naked eyes. Among the latter, the range
of sight is limited, not only because they can only with difficulty
detach themselves from the globe to which they are connected, but
also because the coarseness of their perispirit veils far-off things, in
the same way that fog hides them from the eyes of the body.
       One can therefore understand that, according to its degree
of perfection, a spirit can envision a period of a few years, a few

                                  368

                      The Theory of Foreknowledge


months, a few centuries or even several thousand years, for what is
one century in the face of the infinite? Before such a spirit, events do
not unroll sequentially like the incidents along the traveler’s route;
rather, it sees the beginning and end of the timeframe all at once;
all the events which, during this timeframe comprise the future
for people on earth are the present for this spirit. Consequently, it
will be able to tell us assuredly: “Such and such thing will happen
at such and such time, because I can see the matter just as the man
on the mountain can see what awaits the traveler on his journey.”
If it does not do so, it is because foreknowledge of the future might
be harmful to human beings; it would compromise their free will
and would paralyze them in the endeavor they must accomplish
for their progress. By being unknown, the good and evil that await
them represent a trial.
        If such a faculty, even though restricted, may be found among
the attributes of the creature, then how much more powerful must
it be among those of the Creator, who encompasses the infinite?
For the Creator, time does not exist: the beginning and the end of
worlds are the present. Within this enormous panorama, what is
the span of one person’s life, of one generation, of an entire people?
      4. Nevertheless, since human beings must cooperate in
the overall progress, and since certain events must result from
such cooperation, it might be useful in special cases for them to
foreknow these events in order to prepare the way for them and so
that they may be ready to act when the time comes. This is why
God at times permits a corner of the veil to be lifted, but always for
a useful purpose and never to satisfy vain curiosity. Therefore, such
a mission might not be given to all spirits (since there are those
who do not know the future any better than humans do), but to a
few spirits who are sufficiently advanced for the task. It should be
noted that revelations of this kind are always made spontaneously,
and never, or at least very rarely, in response to a direct request.

                                  369

                         Genesis - Chapter XVI


       5. Furthermore, such a mission may be entrusted to certain
individuals in the following manner:
       Without knowing about the matter, those to whom the
task is given of revealing a hidden matter may receive inspiration
from spirits who do know about it, and they then transmit it
mechanically without realizing it. Moreover, whether during
sleep or during the waking state, as well as during ecstasies and
second sight, it is known that the soul frees itself and to a greater
or lesser degree possesses the faculties of a free spirit. If it is an
advanced spirit, and especially if, like the prophets, it has received
a special mission to that effect, then during the moments of its
emancipation the soul enjoys the faculty of grasping a period of
time of a greater or lesser duration, and it sees the events of that
timeframe as if they were in the present. It may then reveal them in
that same instant or retain the memory of them upon awakening.
If such events must remain secret, it will either forget them or will
retain only a vague intuition sufficient to guide it instinctively.
       6. It is thus that we see this faculty developing providentially
on certain occasions, during imminent danger, great calamities
and revolutions, and it is thus that most persecuted sects have had
numerous seers. Furthermore, it is thus that we have seen great
commanders advance resolutely against the enemy, certain of
victory; that persons of genius, like Christopher Columbus, for
example, pursue an objective, predicting, so to speak, the moment
in which they will reach it: it is because they have seen the goal,
which was not unbeknownst to their spirit.
       Hence, the gift of prediction is no more supernatural than a
multitude of other phenomena. It rests upon the properties of the
soul and the law governing the relationship between the visible and
invisible worlds, and which Spiritism has come to make known.
       Perhaps this theory regarding foreknowledge does not
completely resolve all the cases that the revelation of the future

                                 370

                     The Theory of Foreknowledge


may involve, but it cannot help but be useful in that it establishes
the fundamental principle.
       7. Quite often, whether in the ecstatic or somnambulistic
state, persons endowed with the faculty of foreknowledge see
events as if they were drawn on a blackboard. This may also be
explained by thought photography. Since it is an event in the
thought of the spirits that work for its accomplishment, or in the
individuals whose actions should cause it, such thought, crossing
through space like sounds cross through air, can draw a picture
for the seer. However, since its fulfillment may be hurried up or
delayed, depending on the circumstances, the seer sees the event,
but without being able to determine the exact time. Sometimes,
that particular thought might even be only a plan, a desire that
might not be fulfilled; hence the frequent errors of fact and date
involved in forecasting. (See chap. XIV, no. 13 ff.)
       8. In order to comprehend spiritual matters, that is, in order
to get as clear an idea about them as we could get of a landscape
right in front of our eyes, we actually lack a particular sense, just
as a blind person lacks the sense needed to comprehend the effects
of light, colors and sight apart from physical contact. Thus, it is
not only by an effort of the imagination that we arrive there, but
with the help of comparisons drawn from things that are familiar
to us. Material things, however, can only provide us with highly
imperfect ideas about spiritual things, which is why we cannot
take comparisons literally and believe, for example, that the extent
of the perceptive faculties of spirits depends on how high up they
actually are, and that they must be on a mountain or above the
clouds in order to comprehend time and space.
       Such faculty is inherent to the state of spiritualization, or
rather, dematerialization, meaning that spiritualization produces
an effect that may be compared, although very imperfectly, to that


                                371

                         Genesis - Chapter XVI


of the full range of sight of the man on top of the mountain. The
objective of this comparison is simply to show that events that lie
in the future for some lie in the present for others, and they may
thus be foretold, which does not imply that the effect is produced
in the same way.
       Therefore, to enjoy this perception, the spirit does not have
to go to a particular point in space. A spirit who is at our side here
on earth may possess it as fully as if it were a thousand leagues
away, even though we ourselves could see nothing beyond the
visual horizon. Sight in spirits works neither in the same way nor
with the same elements as it does in human beings; their visual
horizon is entirely different, and it is precisely this sense that keeps
us from conceiving it. A spirit compared with an incarnate is like a
sighted person compared with a blind person.
       9. Furthermore, one must understand that this perception
is not limited to distance, but that it entails being able to penetrate
everything. We will repeat: it is a faculty inherent and proportional
to the spirit’s state of dematerialization. This faculty is weakened
by incarnation; however, it is not annulled completely, for the
soul is not enclosed within the body as in a box. The incarnate
spirit possesses it, although always to a lesser degree than when it
is completely free. This is what gives certain individuals a power of
penetration that others lack completely, giving them a more acute
moral vision and an easier understanding of extra-material matters.
       The incarnate spirit not only perceives but also remembers
what it has seen in the spirit state, and this remembrance is like
a picture drawn in its mind. During incarnation, it can see, but
only vaguely as if through a veil; in the state of freedom it sees
clearly. The principle of sight is not outside it but within it, which
is why it does not need our external light source. Through moral
development, its circle of ideas and concepts broadens; through
gradual dematerialization of the perispirit, it purifies itself from

                                  372

                     The Theory of Foreknowledge


the coarse elements that altered the refinement of its perceptions,
from which it is easy to understand that the extension of a spirit’s
faculties follows its progress.
       10. It is the degree of the extension of the spirit’s faculties
that during incarnation renders it more able or less so to understand
spiritual matters. This aptitude, however, is not the necessary
consequence of the development of intelligence. Ordinary
knowledge does not confer it, which is why we see persons of great
knowledge who are as blind to spiritual matters as others are to
material ones. The former are resistant to spiritual matters because
they do not understand them due to the fact that their progress has
not yet been completed in that sense, whereas persons of ordinary
education and intelligence may be seen to grasp them more easily,
showing that they possess a pre-formed intuition of such matters.
For them, it is a retrospective memory of what they have seen and
known, whether in the errant state or during previous lifetimes,
just as some persons have an intuition about the languages and
sciences that they knew previously.
       11. As for the future of Spiritism, we know that the Spirits
are unanimous in affirming that its triumph is close at hand in
spite of the obstacles put up against it. Such foreknowledge is
easy for them, first of all because its spread is their personal work.
By directly taking part in the movement or by guiding it, they
consequently know what they must do. Second, it is enough for
them to consider a period of short duration, and in this period
they can see the powerful helpers that God furnishes and who will
not be long in manifesting.
       Without having to be discarnate spirits, let Spiritists look
no more than thirty years ahead in the midst of the generation
that is emerging; from there let them consider what is occurring
nowadays; let them follow Spiritism’s progressive march and they


                                 373

                        Genesis - Chapter XVI


will see those who believe they are called to reverse it consumed
in a vain effort; they will see them disappear from the scene little
by little in light of the tree that is growing big and tall, and whose
roots are reaching deeper each and every day.
       12. The ordinary incidents of private life are most often the
result of the way that each person acts. Some people will succeed
according to their capacity, skill, perseverance, prudence and energy,
while others will fail because of their ineptitude; thus, one can say
that each of us is the artisan of his or her own future, a future that
is never subject to blind fatalism independent of the individual. By
knowing an individual’s character, one can easily predict the fate
that awaits him or her on the path her or she has taken.
        13. The events that touch upon the overall interests of
humankind are governed by Providence. When something is in
God’s designs, it must be accomplished one way or another. Men
and women contribute to its execution, but no one is indispensable;
otherwise, God would be at the mercy of God’s creatures. If those
entrusted with a mission fail to fulfill it, someone else will be
assigned to it. No mission is unavoidable; individuals are always
free to fulfill that which has been entrusted to them and which
they have voluntarily accepted. If they do not fulfill it, they lose
the benefit and assume the responsibility for the delays that might
result from their negligence or ill will. If they become an obstacle
to its fulfillment, God can snap them with one breath.
        14. Thus, the final result of an event may be certain because
it lies within God’s designs; however, since the details and method
of execution are most frequently dependent on the circumstances
and human free will, the ways and means may be contingent.
Spirits can give us a sense of the whole if it is useful for us to be
forewarned, but in order to foresee the actual place and date they
would have to know beforehand the decision that such and such


                                 374

                      The Theory of Foreknowledge


individual will make. Therefore, if this decision is not yet in that
individual’s mind, then whatever it turns out to be may speed up
or delay the accomplishment of the event or modify the secondary
means of carrying it out, although everything will still lead to the
same result. Thus it is, for example, that by means of the whole
of the circumstances, spirits can foresee that an unavoidable war
is close at hand or not, but without being able to foresee the exact
day on which it will begin or the detailed incidents that may be
modified by human will.
       15. In order to determine the time of future events, it will
also be necessary to take into account a characteristic inherent to
the very nature of spirits.
       Time, like space, cannot be determined except with the help
of points of comparison or reference that divide it into measurable
periods. On earth, the natural division of time into days and years
is marked out according to the rising and setting of the sun and
how long it takes for the earth to travel around it. The units of
time measurement necessarily vary on different worlds since their
astronomical periods are different. Consequently, on Jupiter, for
example, the days are equivalent to ten of our hours and the years
are almost twelve earth-years.
       Thus, for each world there is a different way for measuring
time according to the nature of the sidereal revolutions involved,
which is why spirits who are not familiar with our world would have
difficulty in determining our dates. However, apart from worlds per
se, there are no such means for determining time. For a spirit in
space, there is neither a sunrise nor a sunset to mark the days, nor
periodic revolutions to mark the years; for such a spirit, there is only
the duration of infinite space (see chap. VI, nos. 1 ff.). Therefore, a
spirit who had never seen the earth would possess no knowledge of
our calculations, which would be completely useless to it; moreover,
a spirit who had never incarnated on any world at all would have

                                  375

                          Genesis - Chapter XVI


no idea about fractions of time measurement. When a spirit who is
foreign to the earth comes to it to manifest itself, it cannot assign dates
to events unless it identifies with our usages, which is undoubtedly
within its abilities, but which, most often, it does not deem useful.
       16. Spirits, who comprise the invisible population of our
globe, where they have already lived and where they continue to live
in our midst, naturally identify with our habits and they continue
to retain a memory of them in the errant state. Consequently, they
can very easily set dates for future events when they know them;
but apart from the fact that it is not always permitted, they are also
prevented from doing so because every time in which the details
of the circumstances are dependent on free will and contingent
human decision-making, a precise date does not actually exist
except after the event is carried out.
       That is why circumstantial predictions cannot offer any
certainty and should be accepted only as probabilities, even
when they do not bear a seal of legitimate suspicion. Also, truly
knowledgeable spirits never make predictions for set times; they
limit themselves to telling us beforehand about the result of matters
that may be useful for us to know about. To insist on obtaining
precise details is to expose oneself to deception by frivolous spirits,
who, without any regard for the truth, foretell anything and
everything one might want to know about, and who entertain
themselves with the terrors and disappointments they cause.
      17. The manner generally employed to date with regards to
predictions makes them true, often indecipherable enigmas. This
mysterious and Cabalistic form, of which Nostradamus provides
the most complete example, gives them a certain prestige in the eyes
of the common folk, who attribute more value to them the more
incomprehensible they appear to be. Because of their ambiguity,
they lend themselves to many different interpretations, so much


                                   376

                     The Theory of Foreknowledge


so that, according to the meaning attributed to certain allegorical
or conventional words, or according to the way certain bizarrely
complicated calculations of dates are made, together with a little
goodwill, one can find shortly afterward almost anything one wants.
       Whatever the case may be, one cannot deny the fact that
some predictions display a serious character and are confounding
because of their truthfulness. It is probable that this veiled manner
at one time had its reason for being and even its necessity.
       Today, however, the circumstances are no longer the same.
The positivism of the present century hardly accommodates sibylline
language. Also, predictions nowadays no longer utilize such strange
forms; those made by the Spirits have nothing mystical about them.
They speak the language of everyone else, just as they would have
while alive, since they have not ceased to belong to humankind.
They warn us about future personal or general matters whenever it
might be useful, and to the degree of discernment with which they
are endowed, just as counselors and friends would do. Thus, their
predictions are more like warnings that take nothing from free will,
rather than predictions per se, which imply an unavoidable fatalism.
Moreover, their opinion is nearly always properly explained because
they do not want people to use blind faith to disregard their reason,
which enables them to evaluate their soundness.
       18. Contemporary humankind also has its prophets. More
than one writer, poet, literary person, historian or philosopher has
sensed in his or her writings the future march of things that are
coming into being today.
       Undoubtedly, this aptitude often results from a correct
judgment that deduces the logical consequences of the present; but
frequently it is also the result of a special unconscious clairvoyance
or an inspiration coming from the outside. What such individuals
did while living they can more ably and precisely do in the spirit
state, when their spirit sight is no longer obscured by matter.

     they thus made of him an object of scandal. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is
     dishonored only in his home town and in his own home.” And he did not perform
     many miracles there because of their disbelief. (Mt. 13:54-58)

      2. Here, Jesus enunciates a truth that became a proverb,
which is for all time and which could be extended further by
saying that no one is a prophet while still alive.

                        Genesis - Chapter XVII


       In usual language, this maxim applies to the credibility some
persons enjoy amongst their own and those in the midst of whom
they live, and to the trust that they inspire through the superiority
of their wisdom and intelligence. If there are exceptions to this
maxim, they are rare, and are never absolute in any case. The
principle of this truth is a natural consequence of human weakness,
and can be explained as follows:
       The habit of being seen from infancy in the ordinary
circumstances of life establishes among people a sort of material
equality, which quite often makes them refuse to acknowledge
the moral ascendancy of someone who has been a companion or
dinner guest, someone who has been one of them, and whose earlier
weaknesses used to be witnessed; pride suffers at the ascendancy
that it is obliged to bear. Those who raise themselves above the
ordinary are always the target of jealousy and envy; those who feel
incapable of reaching the same level make an effort to bring them
down by means of defamation, slander and libel; the smaller they
feel, the louder they yell, thinking they make themselves bigger
and that they can eclipse such individuals by the noise they make.
Such has been and always will be the history of humankind as
long as people do not understand their spiritual nature or broaden
their moral horizon. This prejudice is also characteristic of narrow-
minded and commonplace spirits, who compare everything to
their own personalities.
       Moreover, it usually applies to persons who are known only
for their mind, an ideal that increases with the distance of time
and place. They are almost entirely divested of their humanity;
it seems that they should neither speak nor feel like everyone
else; that their language and thoughts must constantly be in
tune with sublimity, without considering that the mind cannot
stay constantly over-extended and in a continuous state of over-
excitement. In the daily contact of private life, one sees much of


                                 380

                       Predictions in the Gospel


the corporeal individual, who is no different from other ordinary
persons. The corporeal human being, who impacts the senses,
nearly always eclipses the spiritual human being, who impacts
only the mind. From a distance, one sees only the sparks of genius;
up close, one sees the mind at rest.
       After death there is no longer any comparison; only the
spiritual person remains and seems to be all the greater the more
distant the memory of the corporeal person is. This is why those
who have marked their passage upon the earth with works of true
value are more appreciated after their death than when they were
alive. They are judged with more impartiality, because envies
and jealousies have disappeared and thus personal animosities no
longer exist. Posterity is a disinterested judge that evaluates the
work of the mind: it accepts it without blind enthusiasm if it is
good, and rejects it without disdain if it is bad, separating the
individuality from what it produced.
       Even Jesus himself could not escape the consequences
of this principle inherent to human nature, because he lived
in a little-enlightened environment among people completely
absorbed in material life. His fellow citizens saw in him nothing
but the son of a carpenter, the brother of siblings as uneducated
as they were; and they asked themselves what it was that could
make him superior to them and give him the right to criticize
them. Additionally, seeing that his word had less authority over
his own people, who despised him, than over foreigners, he went
to preach amongst those who would listen to him and those with
whom he found sympathy.
       One can get an idea of the sentiments that incited his family
against him by the incident in which his own brothers and mother
went to a gathering where he was present in order to take custody
of him, saying that he had lost his mind. (Mk. 3:20-21, 31-35; The
Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. XIV)


                                 381

                            Genesis - Chapter XVII


      Thus, on the one hand, the priests and Pharisees accused
him of acting in league with the Devil; on the other, he was labeled
as crazy by his closest family members. Do we not see the same
thing nowadays regarding Spiritists, and do they not complain
that they are not being treated any better by their fellow citizens
than Jesus was? What was not surprising at all two thousand years
ago amongst an unlearned people seems quite strange in the 19th
century amongst civilized nations.

          The Death and Passion of Jesus
      3. (After the healing of the madman) All were amazed at the great
      power of God. And when everyone was amazed at what Jesus was doing,
      he said to his disciples, “Guard well in your hearts what I am about
      to tell you: The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men.”
      However, they did not understand such language. It was so hidden from
      them that they could not understand any of it and they were afraid to ask
      him about it. (Lk. 9:43-45)

      4. From then on, Jesus began to reveal to his disciples that he would have to
      go to Jerusalem; that there he would suffer much from the elders, scribes, and
      chief priests; that he would be put to death and would rise from the dead on
      the third day. (Mt. 16:21)

      5. When they were in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man must
      be delivered into the hands of men; and they will kill him and he shall rise
      from the dead on the third day.” This grieved them severely. (Mt. 17:22-23)

      6. Now, as Jesus was going to Jerusalem, he took his twelve disciples aside
      and said to them, “We are going to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be
      delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, who will condemn him to death.
      And they will deliver him to the Gentiles so that they may mock, flog and
      crucify him, and he will rise again on the third day. (Mt. 20:17-19)


                                      382

                     Predictions in the Gospel


7. Then, taking his twelve disciples aside, Jesus said to them, “We are going
to Jerusalem, and everything that was written by the prophets concerning
the Son of Man will be fulfilled; for he will be handed over to the Gentiles;
they will mock him, and he will be flogged and put to death, and he will rise
again on the third day.”

However, they did not comprehend any of this; his language was veiled to
them and they did not understand what he was saying. (Lk. 18:31-34)

8. And having finished saying all these things, Jesus said to his disciples,
“You know that Passover is two days from now, and that the Son of Man will
be handed over to be crucified.”

At the same time, the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the
court of Caiaphas the high priest, and they held council together to find
a way to adroitly arrest Jesus and put him to death. They said, “It must
not be done during the feast so that there will not be a riot among the
people.” (Mt. 26:1-5)

9. On the same day, some Pharisees came and said to him, “Leave this place,
for Herod wants to kill you.” He responded, “Go tell that fox: I must still
drive out demons and restore health to the sick today and tomorrow, and on
the third day, I will be consummated in death.” (Lk. 13:31-32)



    The Persecution of the Apostles
10. “Guard yourselves against men, for they will make you appear before
their councils and they will flog you in their synagogues. And on account of
me you will be presented to governors and kings to serve as witnesses to them,
as well as to the Gentiles.” (Mt. 10:17-18)

11. “They will throw you out of the synagogues; and the time will come in
which those who kill you will believe they are doing something pleasing to



                                383

                     Genesis - Chapter XVII


God. They will treat you like this because they know neither my Father nor
me. Now, I am telling you these things so that when the time comes, you will
remember what I told you.” (Jn. 16:1-4)

 12. “You will be betrayed and handed over to the magistrates by your
fathers and mothers, your brothers, your relatives and your friends, and they
will put many of you to death. You will be hated by everyone on account of
my name. Nevertheless, you will not lose one hair from your head. By your
patience you will possess your souls.” (Lk. 21:16-19)

13. (The martyrdom of Peter) “Verily, verily I say to you that when you
were younger you dressed yourselves and went where you wanted; but when
you are old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you
and lead you where you do not want to go.” Now, he said this to indicate by
what kind of death Peter would glorify God. (Jn. 21:18-19)



                Unrepentant Cities
14. Then, he began to reproach the cities in which he had performed many
miracles, for they had not repented.

“Woe to you, Korazin, and woe to you, Bethsaida, for if the miracles that I
performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would
have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. Therefore, I declare to you
that, on the Day of Judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be treated less harshly
than you.

“And you, Capernaum, will you always be lifted up to heaven? You
shall be brought down to the depths of hell, for if the miracles that were
performed in your midst had been performed in Sodom, it would perhaps
have remained until today. Therefore, I declare to you that, on the Day
of Judgment, the country of Sodom will be treated less harshly than
you. (Mt. 11:20-24)

                      Predictions in the Gospel


             The Destruction of the
             Temple and Jerusalem
15. When Jesus went out of the Temple to leave, his disciples approached
him to point out to him the structure and grandeur of that building.
However, he said to them, “Do you see all these buildings? Verily, verily I
say to you, they will all be destroyed so that not one stone will be left upon
another.” (Mt. 24:1-2)

16. Then, having drawn close to Jerusalem and seeing the city, he wept for
it, saying, “Oh! If only on this day that is still given to you, you could realize
what could give you peace! But now it is all hidden from your eyes. Therefore,
a time shall come – unfortunately for you – in which your enemies will
surround you with trenches. They will encircle you and press in upon you
from all sides. They will dash you to the ground, you and your children who
are with you, and they will not leave one stone upon another, for you did
not acknowledge the time in which God had visited you.” (Lk. 19:41-44)

17. “Nevertheless, I must continue on today, tomorrow and the next day, for
no prophet must suffer death anywhere else but in Jerusalem.

“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills prophets and stones those who are sent to
you, how many times I have wanted to gather your children together like a
hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you did not want it! The time
is at hand in which your house will become deserted. Verily, verily I tell you
that you will not see me again until you say: Blessed is he who comes in the
name of the Lord.” (Lk. 13:33-35)

18. “When you see an army surrounding Jerusalem, you will know that its
destruction is at hand. Then, let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
let not those who are in the neighboring region enter it, for those days shall
be days of vengeance, so that everything written in the Scriptures may be
fulfilled. Unfortunate will be those who are pregnant or nursing in those days,


                                  385

                             Genesis - Chapter XVII


      for this country shall be oppressed with ills, and the wrath of heaven shall fall
      upon this people. They shall be put to the edge of the sword; they shall be led
      captive into all nations, and Jerusalem shall be treaded upon by the feet of
      the Gentiles until the time of the nations has been fulfilled.” (Lk. 21:20-24)

      19. (Jesus is on the way to his death) Now, he was followed by a large crowd
      of people and women who were wailing and weeping. But Jesus turned to
      them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for
      yourselves and your children; for the time shall come when you will say,
      ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that have never given birth to children
      and the breasts that have never nursed.’ They shall say to the mountains,
      ‘Fall upon us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ for if the green wood is treated like
      this, how will the dry wood be treated?” (Lk. 23:27-31)

       20. The faculty of foreseeing future things is one of the
soul’s attributes, and is explained by the theory of foreknowledge.
Jesus possessed it as well as all the other attributes to an eminent
degree. He could therefore foresee the events that would take place
after his death without there being anything supernatural about the
phenomenon, which we see being reproduced right before our eyes
in the most ordinary circumstances. It is not rare for individuals to
state precisely the moment in which they will die. Their soul, in the
state of detachment, is like the man on top of the mountain (chap.
XVI, no. 1): it comprehends the road to be traveled and sees its end.
      21. Such was even more the case with Jesus, who, having
full awareness of the mission he had come to fulfill, knew that
death by torture was the necessary outcome. Spirit sight, which
was continuous in him, as well as the reading of thought, must
have shown him the circumstances and the inevitable time. For the
same reason, he could foresee the destruction of the Temple and
Jerusalem, the misfortunes that would befall the city’s inhabitants,
and the dispersion of the Jews.

                      Predictions in the Gospel


    The Curse against the Pharisees
22. (John the Baptist) Seeing several of the Pharisees and Sadducees who
were coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who
warned you to flee the wrath that must fall upon you? Therefore, produce
fruit worthy of repentance; and do not think about saying amongst yourselves,
‘We have Abraham as our father’; for I declare to you that God can make
these very stones give birth to sons of Abraham. The ax has already been put
to the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, that does not produce good fruit
shall be cut down and thrown into the fire.” (Mt. 3:7-10)

23. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut the
kingdom of heaven to men; because you yourselves shall not enter and yet you
oppose those who desire to enter!

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisee, hypocrites, because under the pretext of
long prayers you devour the houses of widows; therefore, you shall receive a
harsher judgment!

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel land and
sea to win a convert, and after you have won him, you make him twice as
worthy of hell as you yourselves!

“Woe to you, blind leaders, who say, ‘If a man swears by the Temple, it
means nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple must fulfill
his oath!’ How foolish and blind you are! What should be worth more: the
gold or the Temple that sanctifies the gold? ‘And if a man,’ you say, ‘swears
by the altar, it means nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon
the altar must fulfill his oath.’ How blind you are! What should be worth
more: the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore, he who swears
by the altar swears by the altar and everything that is upon it; and whoever
swears by the Temple swears by the Temple and the one who inhabits it; and
he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who is
seated upon it.

                      Genesis - Chapter XVII


“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, who pay a tenth of your mint,
dill and cumin, but have abandoned what is most important in the law:
justice, mercy and faith! These are what you should practice, but without
omitting the others. You blind guides, who take great care to strain what you
drink for fear of swallowing a gnat, but who swallow a camel!

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you clean the outside
of the cup and plate, but on the inside you are full of greed and impurity!
Blind Pharisees! First, clean the inside of the cup and plate so that the outside
may also be clean.

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you are like
whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful to men’s eyes, but
which on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of decay!
Hence, on the outside you appear to be just, but on the inside you are full of
hypocrisy and iniquity.

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisee, who build tombs for the prophets and
decorate the graves of the righteous, saying, ‘If we had lived at the time of our
fathers, we would not have associated with those who spilled the blood of the
prophets!’ Finish filing up the measure of your fathers! You serpents, you brood
of vipers, how will you avoid being condemned to hell? Therefore, I will send
you prophets, wise men and scribes, and you will kill some, crucify others and
you will whip others in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city,
so that upon you will fall all the innocent blood that has been spilled on the
earth, from the blood of Abel, the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah, son of
Berakiah, whom you killed between the Temple and the altar! Verily, verily I
say to you that all this shall befall this present generation.” (Mt. 23:13-36)



     My Words Shall Not Pass Away
24. Then, his disciples approached him and said, “Did you know that when
the Pharisees heard what you just said, they were scandalized by it?” But



                                  388

                           Predictions in the Gospel


       he answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted shall
       be uprooted. Never mind them; they are blind leading the blind; if a blind
       person leads another, they both will fall into a pit.” (Mt. 15:12-14)

       25. “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
       away.” (Mt. 24:35)

         26. Jesus’ words shall not pass away, for they will be true
for all time. His moral code will be eternal, because it contains the
conditions of the good that lead men and women to their eternal
destiny. However, have his words come down to us free from
interpolations and false interpretations? Have all Christian sects
grasped their true spirit? Have none of them deviated from their true
meaning as a result of preconceptions and of ignorance of the laws of
nature? Have none of them made of them an instrument of control
to serve ambition and material interests, a stepping stone, not for
ascension to heaven but for ascension on the earth? Have all of them
proposed as a rule of conduct the practicing of the virtues that Jesus
made the express condition for salvation? Are they all exempt from
the reproach he directed at the Pharisees of his time? Finally, are they
all, in theory as well as in practice, the pure expression of his doctrine?
         Since truth is one, it cannot be found in contradictory
statements, and Jesus could not have intended to give a double
meaning to his words. Therefore, if different sects contradict one
another, if some regard as true what others condemn as heresy,
there is no possibility for all of them to possess the truth. If all had
grasped the true meaning of the Gospel, they would have met on
the same ground and there would have been no sects.
         That which shall not pass away is the true meaning of Jesus’
words; that which shall pass away is what people have built upon
the erroneous meaning they have given to those very words.
         Since Jesus’ mission was to bring God’s thought to
humankind, only his pure doctrine can be the expression of that


                                       389

                            Genesis - Chapter XVII


thought. That is why he said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father
has not planted shall be uprooted.”

                        The Cornerstone
      27. “Have you never read this in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that was rejected
      by those who built has become the chief cornerstone; the Lord has done it and
      it is wonderful in our eyes’? Therefore, I declare to you that the kingdom of
      God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
      He who lets himself fall upon this stone shall be broken, and it shall crush
      him on whom it falls.”

      Having heard Jesus’ words, the chief priests and the Pharisees realized that he
      had spoken about them; but wanting to arrest him, they were afraid of the
      people because they regarded him as a prophet. (Mt. 21:42-46)

       28. Jesus’ word became the cornerstone, that is, the
consolidation stone of the new edifice of the law built upon the
ruins of the old. The Jews, the chief priests and the Pharisees
rejected that stone; hence, it crushed them just as it will crush
those who later misinterpreted it or who distorted its meaning to
benefit their ambition.

 The Parable of the Murderous Vinedressers
      29. “There was a father of a family, who, having planted a vineyard,
      surrounded it with a hedge; and excavating the ground, he built a tower.
      Then, putting some vinedressers in charge of it, he went to a distant region.

      “Now, when harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the vinedressers
      to harvest the fruit of his vineyard. But the vinedressers seized his servants
      and wounded one, killed another and stoned another. He sent other servants
      in greater numbers than the first group but they were treated in the same


                                       390

                          Predictions in the Gospel


      way. Finally, he sent his own son, saying to himself, ‘They will have some
      respect for my son.’ But upon seeing the son, the vinedressers said to one
      another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and then we will be the
      owners of his inheritance.’ Thus, having seized him, they threw him out of
      the vineyard and killed him.

      “When the owner of the vineyard comes, how will he treat those vinedressers?”
      They answered, “He will make those evil ones die miserably and will
      put other vinedressers in charge who will give him the fruit at the proper
      time.” (Mt. 21:33-41)

       30. The father of the family is God; the vineyard he planted
is the divine law he established; the vinedressers he put in charge
of the vineyard are those who should teach and practice the law;
the servants whom he sent to them are the prophets whom they
murdered; the son whom he finally sent is Jesus, whom they
murdered as well. Hence, how will the Lord treat those in authority
who prevaricate against his law? He will treat them as they treated
his messengers, and will call others who will take better care of his
property and who will lead his flock more ably.
       Thus it was with the scribes, the chief priests and the
Pharisees; thus it will be when he comes again to ask each one to
give an accounting for what he or she has done with his Doctrine.
He will take authority away from whoever abused it, for he wants
his fields to be administered according to his will.
       After eighteen centuries, humankind has reached adulthood
and is mature enough to understand what Christ could only touch
upon, because, as he himself said, they would not have understood.
But what has been the result of those who throughout that long
period have been in charge of humankind’s religious education? To
see indifference replace faith, and disbelief become a doctrine. In
fact, at no other time have skepticism and the spirit of denial been
more widespread among all classes of society.

       However, if some of Christ’s words are veiled in allegory,
everything concerning the rules of conduct, human relationships
and the moral principles that he made as the express condition
for salvation are clear, explicit and unambiguous. (See The Gospel
according to Spiritism, chap. XV)
       What has been done to his maxims of charity, love and
tolerance; his recommendations to his disciples for converting
others through kindness and persuasion; the simplicity, humility,
disinterestedness and all the virtues that he himself exemplified?
In his name people have anathematized and cursed one another,
and have massacred one another in the name of him who said:
All humans are brothers and sisters. They have made a jealous,
cruel, vengeful and biased God out of the one he proclaimed to be
infinitely just, good and merciful. To that God of peace and truth
thousands of victims have been slain by burnings at the stake,
torture and persecution in a way that the pagans never sacrificed
to their false gods. They have sold prayers and the favors of heaven
in the name of the one who drove the moneychangers out of the
Temple, and who said to his disciples, “Give freely what you have
received freely.”
       What would Christ say if he were to live among us today?
If he saw his representatives pursue the honor, wealth, power and
luxury of the princes of the world, while he, more of a king than all
the kings of earth, made his entry into Jerusalem riding a donkey?
Would he not be right in saying to them: What have you done to
my teachings, you who worship the golden calf, who offer most of
your prayers for the rich and few for the poor in spite of my having
said to you: The first shall be last and the last shall be first in the
kingdom of heaven? Even though he is not here in the flesh, he is
here in spirit, and like the lord in the parable he will demand an
accounting from the vinedressers of the product of his vineyard
when harvest time comes.


                                 392

                           Predictions in the Gospel


   Only One flock and only One Shepherd
      31. “I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold; I must lead them also;
      they will listen to my voice and there will be only one flock and only one
      shepherd.” (Jn. 10:16)

       32. With these words, Jesus clearly states that people
will someday be united by one single belief. But how will this
unification be accomplished? The matter would seem difficult in
light of the differences between religions, the antagonism they
nourish among their respective adherents, and their stubbornness
in believing they have exclusive possession of the truth. They all
want unity, but they all flatter themselves by thinking that it will
happen to their advantage, and none accept making concessions
regarding their own articles of faith.
       Nevertheless, unity of religion will be accomplished, just
as social, political and commercial unity will be accomplished
by the breaking down of the barriers that separate peoples, and
by the assimilation of customs, habits and languages. Peoples
all over the world are already joining hands, like those who are
included in the provinces comprising one empire. Everyone can
sense this unity and everyone desires it. It will be accomplished
through the very force of things, because it will become a necessity
for strengthening the ties of fraternity among nations. It will be
accomplished through the development of human reason, which
will understand the childishness of all disagreements, and through
the progress of the sciences, which demonstrate every day the
material errors upon which such disagreements are based and little
by little break loose the crumbling stones of their foundations.
Even though science may destroy in religions what is the work of
humans and the fruit of their ignorance of the laws of nature, it
will not be able to destroy – despite the opinion of some – what is


                                      393

                       Genesis - Chapter XVII


the work of God and eternal truth. By cleaning out the accessories,
it prepares the way for unity.
       In order to reach this unity, religions will have to meet one
another on neutral ground common to all of them. To do so,
all will have to make greater or lesser concessions and sacrifices,
depending on the multiplicity of their own particular dogmas.
However, in virtue of the principle of immutability, which all
profess, the initiative of such concessions will not come from the
official camp. Instead of taking their departure point from above,
they will take it from below through individual initiative. After
some time, a decentralization movement will begin that will tend
to acquire an irresistible force. The principle of immutability,
which religions have always regarded as a protective shield, will
become an element of destruction, because, since their creeds will
be standing still while society progresses, they will be surpassed
and later absorbed by the current of progressive ideas.
       Instead of being a force, immobility becomes a cause of
weakness and ruin for those who do not keep pace with the
overall movement; immobility breaks down unity, because those
who want to advance are separated from those who obstinately
remain behind.
       In the current state of opinion and knowledge, the religion
which will someday unite all people under one banner will be the
one that best satisfies reason and the authentic aspirations of the
heart and mind; which will at no point be contradicted by positive
science; which, instead of being immobile, will keep pace with
humankind on its progressive march without ever allowing itself
to be surpassed; which will be neither exclusivist nor intolerant;
which will be the emancipator of the mind and which will accept
nothing but rational faith. It will be the one whose moral code will
be the purest, the most logical, the most in harmony with social
needs; finally, the one that is the most suitable for founding the

                           Predictions in the Gospel


kingdom of the good on earth through the practice of universal
charity and fraternity.
       What feeds the antagonism among religions is the fact that
each one has its own particular god and that each claims to possess
the only true and most powerful one, who is in constant battle
with the gods of the other creeds and is busy combating their
influence. Once they are all finally convinced that there is only
one God in the universe and that in all actuality it is the very same
one whom they worship under the name of Yahweh, Allah or God,
and once they are in accord on God’s essential attributes, they
will understand that a sole Being can have only one will. Then,
they will shake hands as servants of one and the same Lord and as
children of one and the same Father, and they will have taken a
great step toward unity.

                   The Coming of Elijah
      33. Then, his disciples asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must
      come first?” Jesus answered, “It is true that Elijah must come and that he
      will reestablish all things.

      “But I declare to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize
      him, but treated him as they pleased. In the same way, they will put the Son
      of Man to death.”

      Then, his disciples understood that he had spoken to them of John the
      Baptist. (Mt. 17:10-13)

      34. Elijah had already returned in the person of John the
Baptist. His coming again is announced explicitly; thus, since he
could not return except in a new body, it is the formal consecration
of the principle of the plurality of existences. (See The Gospel
according to Spiritism, chap. IV, no. 10)

                                   Genesis - Chapter XVII


            The Announcement of the Consoler
            35. “If you love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask my Father and
            he will send you another Consoler in order that It may be with you forever:
            the Spirit of Truth, whom this world cannot receive because it cannot see
            It150. But as for you, you will recognize It because it will remain with you
            and will be within you. But the Consoler, the Holy Spirit, which my Father
            will send in my name, will teach you all things and will enable you to
            remember everything that I have said to you.” (Jn. 14:15-17, 26; The
            Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. VI)

            36. “However, I tell you the truth: it is necessary for me to go, for if I do
            not, the Consoler will not come to you. But I am going and will send It to
            you. And when It comes, it will convict the world regarding sin, justice and
            judgment – regarding sin because they have not believed in me; regarding
            justice, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more;
            regarding judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.

            “I still have many things to say to you, but you could not bear them at this
            time.

            “When the Spirit of Truth comes, It will teach you the entire truth, because It
            will not speak of Itself, but will say everything that It has heard, and It shall
            announce to you the things to come.

            “It shall glorify me, because It will receive what is mine and will announce
            it to you.” (Jn. 16:7-14)

      37. There can be no question that this is one of the most
important from a religious point of view, because, beyond any
shadow of a doubt, it demonstrates that Jesus did not say everything
that he had to say because it would not have been understood,
150
      The New Testament Greek pronoun is autó, the neuter form, which in English translations
      is rendered in the masculine. In keeping with the Greek form and the Spiritist meaning of
      the pronoun, we have translated it in the neuter. – Tr.



                                               396

                       Predictions in the Gospel


even by his disciples, since it was to them that he was speaking.
If he had given them secret teachings, the Gospel would make
reference to them. Since he did not tell his disciples everything,
their successors did not know anymore than they did. Therefore,
they could have been mistaken as to the meaning of his words, or
could have given a false interpretation to his thoughts, often veiled
in the form of parables. Religions that are founded on the Gospel
cannot, therefore, be said to possess the entire truth, because Jesus
reserved for himself the final completion of his teachings. The
principle of immutability, to which religions hold, contradicts the
very words of Jesus.
       By the name Consoler and the Spirit of Truth Jesus announces
the one that would teach all things and enable his disciples to
remember what he had told them. Hence, his teaching was not
complete; furthermore, he foresees that what he said would be
forgotten and distorted, since the Spirit of Truth would enable
them to remember, and, in accordance with Elijah, would reestablish
all things, that is, according to Jesus’ true thought.
       38. When would this new revealer come? It is quite obvious
that, if at the time in which Jesus was speaking people were in no
state to comprehend the things that he still had to say, it would
not be just a matter of a few years before they would acquire the
understanding they needed. In order to comprehend certain parts
of the Gospel – except for the moral precepts – knowledge was
required which only the progress of science could provide, and
which would have to be the work of time and many generations.
Therefore, if the new Messiah had come shortly after Christ, It
would have found the ground still unfavorable, and would not
have done any more than Christ himself. Thus, from the time of
Christ until now, no great revelation was produced that would
have completed the Gospel and elucidated its obscure parts – a
sure indicator that the Envoy had not yet appeared.

                                 397

                                   Genesis - Chapter XVII


       39. What must this Envoy be? By stating, “I will ask my Father
and he will send you another Consoler,” Jesus clearly indicates that
this Consoler would not be Jesus himself; otherwise, he would have
said, “I will return to complete what I have taught you.” Then, he
adds, “So that It may remain with you forever and be within you.” This
statement could not refer to an incarnate individuality – an incarnate
individuality could not remain with us forever, much less be within
us – but it should well be understood as a doctrine, which, in fact,
when assimilated, could be with us forever. The Consoler is, therefore,
according to Jesus’ thought, the personification of a supremely
consoling doctrine, whose inspirer would be the Spirit of Truth.
        40. As demonstrated earlier (chap. I, no. 30), Spiritism
fulfills all the conditions of the Consoler promised by Jesus. It is
neither an individual doctrine nor a human conception; no one
may be said to be its creator. It is the product of the collective
teaching of the Spirits, over which the Spirit of Truth presides. It
does not eliminate anything in the Gospel; rather, it completes
and elucidates it. With the help of the new laws that it reveals,
together with those of science, it makes comprehensible what used
to be unintelligible, and admits the possibility of what disbelief
considered as inadmissible. It has had its precursors and prophets,
who foresaw its coming. Through its moralizing power, it is
preparing the kingdom of the good on earth.
        Moses’ doctrine was incomplete and remained circumscribed
to the Jewish people; Jesus’ doctrine was more complete and
spread over all the earth through Christianity but did not convert
everybody; having roots in all belief systems, Spiritism’s doctrine is
even more complete and will convert humankind.151
151
      All the philosophical and religious doctrines bear the name of a founding individual: one
      says: Mosaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Cartesianism, Fourierism, St.
      Simonism, etc. The word Spiritism, on the other hand, does not refer to any one person;
      it entails an overall idea that indicates both the character and multiple source of the
      Doctrine. – Auth.



                                               398

       41. In telling his disciples, “Another will come later, which will
teach you what I cannot say to you at this time,” Jesus was declaring
the necessity of reincarnation. How could those men profit from a
more complete teaching that would be given later on? How could
they understand it if they did not live again? Jesus would have spoken
a meaningless proposition if, according to common doctrine, future
people would be new individuals, souls who came out of nothingness
at birth. On the other hand, if we admit the fact that the disciples
and the people of that time have lived again since then – that they
are living again today – then the promise of Jesus is fully justified.
Their intelligence, which was to develop through contact with social
progress, can now grasp what it could not bear back then. Without
reincarnation, Jesus’ promise would have been illusory.
        42. If it were stated that that promise was fulfilled on the Day
of Pentecost by the descent of the Holy Spirit, one would reply that
the Holy Spirit inspired the disciples, opened up their intelligence
and developed within them the mediumistic aptitudes that would
facilitate their missions; nevertheless, it did not teach them anything
beyond what Jesus himself had taught, because one finds no trace
of a special teaching. Consequently, the Holy Spirit did not fulfill
what Jesus had announced regarding the Consoler; otherwise,
when they were alive the apostles would have elucidated everything
that has remained obscure in the Gospel until today, and whose
contradictory interpretation has given rise to the innumerable sects
that have divided Christianity since the early centuries.

            The Second Coming of Christ
      43. Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wishes to come after me, let
      him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me; for he who wants to save his
      life shall lose it and he who loses his life out of love for me shall find it again.



                                         399

                           Genesis - Chapter XVII


      “What good does it do a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? Or
      what can a man exchange to redeem his soul after he has lost it? For the Son
      of Man must come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and will give to
      each according to his deeds.

      “Verily, verily I say to you, there are some of those who are here today who
      will not suffer death without having seen the Son of Man come in his
      kingdom. (Mt. 16:24-28)

      44. Then, after being led into the midst of the assembly, the high priest
      questioned Jesus and said to him, “Do you not respond to me regarding what
      has been said against you?” But Jesus remained silent and did not respond.
      The high priest questioned him further and said to him, “Are you the Christ,
      the Son of the ever-blessed God?” Jesus responded to him, “I am he, and
      someday you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God’s
      majesty and coming upon the clouds of heaven.”

      Immediately, the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further
      testimony do we need?” (Mk. 14:60-63)

       45. Jesus announced his second coming, but he did not
say that he would return to earth in a corporeal body, or that the
Consoler would be personified in him. He represented himself as
having to come in spirit, in the glory of his Father, to judge merit
and demerit, and to render to all according to their deeds when
the times were fulfilled.
       This verbal promise: “there are some of those who are here
today who shall not suffer death without having seen the Son of Man
come in his kingdom” seems like a contradiction, since it is obvious
that he did not come during the lifetime of any of those who were
present at the time. However, Jesus could not have been mistaken
about a prediction of that nature, and especially regarding a
contemporary issue that concerned him personally. One must ask
first whether his words were always transmitted faithfully, which


                                      400

                        Predictions in the Gospel


could be doubted if we remember that he wrote nothing down;
that his words were collected only after his death; and when it
is seen that the same discourse was nearly always reproduced by
each Evangelist in different terms. This is obvious proof that they
are not the textual products of Jesus himself. Furthermore, the
meaning sometimes must have been altered as they passed through
successive translations.
       On the other hand, it is certain that if Jesus had said everything
that he could have said, he would have expressed himself more
clearly and precisely about everything, without leaving any room
for mistake – as he did regarding his moral principles – whereas
he had to veil his thought regarding subjects that he did not deem
appropriate to delve into. The apostles, persuaded that the present
generation would witness what he had announced, interpreted
Jesus’ thought according to their idea. Consequently, they wrote it
down from the point of view of the present, rendering it in a more
absolute manner than he himself perhaps had done. At any rate,
the fact is that things did not happen as they thought they would.
       46. A crucial point that Jesus was not able to develop
because the people of his time were not sufficiently prepared for
ideas of that order or their consequences, but for which he set
forth the principle – just as he did for all matters – was the great
and important law of reincarnation. This law, studied and brought
to light in our days by Spiritism, is the key to many passages in the
Gospel, which, without it, seem nonsensical.
       It is by means of this law that one can find a rational
explanation for the above-cited words, if one accepts them as
textual. Since they cannot be applied to the apostles personally, it
is obvious that they refer to the future reign of Christ, that is, to
the time in which his doctrine would be better understood and
would become universal law. By telling them that some of those
who are present would witness his coming, this can be understood

                                  401

                                    Genesis - Chapter XVII


only in the sense that they would live again at that time. The Jews,
however, believed that they were going to witness everything that
Jesus announced, and took his allegories literally.
       Moreover, some of his predictions did come true during
their time, such as the destruction of Jerusalem, the misfortunes
that would result from it, and the dispersion of the Jews. However,
Jesus took his vision farther, and speaking in the present, he
constantly made allusion to the future.

                                 Precursory Signs
            47. “You shall also hear talk of wars and rumors of war; but guard yourselves
            well against being troubled, for these things must occur. But this will not yet
            be the end, for you will see nation rise up against nation and kingdom against
            kingdom; and there will be plagues, famine and earthquakes in many places,
            but all these things will be only the beginning of pains.” (Mt. 24:6-8)

            48. “Then, brother shall hand brother over to death, and father his son;
            children shall rise up against their fathers and mothers and have them put
            to death. And you will be hated by everyone on account of my name; but he
            who perseveres until the end shall be saved.” (Mk. 13:12-13)

            49. “When you see that the abomination of desolation, which was
            foretold by the prophet Daniel, is within the holy place (let him who
            reads this understand well what he reads); then let those who are in Judea
            flee to the mountains152; let him who is on the roof not come down to take
            anything from his house, and let him who is in the field not return to

152
      This expression: the abomination of desolation not only makes no sense, but borders
      on the ridiculous. Ostervald’s translation states: the abomination that causes desolation,
      which is very different. Then the meaning becomes perfectly clear, because then one may
      understand that abominations must lead to desolation as a punishment. Jesus said that
      when the abomination is seen in the holy place, desolation will also be seen there, and this
      will be a sign that the time is near. – Auth.

get his clothes. But woe to women who are pregnant or nursing in those
days. Therefore, pray to God that your flight will not occur in winter or
on a Sabbath, for the affliction of that time will be so great that there
will have been nothing like it from the beginning of the world until now,
nor will there ever be. And if those days had not been shortened, no one
would be saved; however, those days will be shortened for the sake of the
elect.” (Mt. 24:15-22)

50. “Immediately after those days of affliction the sun will be darkened and
the moon will no longer give its light; the stars will fall from the sky and the
powers of the heavens will be shaken.

“Then, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and all the nations
of the earth will wail and moan; and they will see the Son of Man, who will
come upon the clouds in the sky with great majesty.

“He will send his angels, who will make heard the sound of their trumpets,
and they will gather his elect from the four corners of the world, from one
end of the sky to the other.

“Learn a comparison taken from the fig tree. When its branches have become
tender and have brought forth leaves, you know that summer is near. In the
same way, when you see all these things, you will know that the Son of Man
is near, and that he is right at the door.

“Verily, verily I say unto you that this generation will not pass away as long
as all these things have not been fulfilled.” (Mt. 24:29-34)

“And it will be at the coming of the Son of Man as it was in the time of Noah,
for as in the last days before the flood, men ate and drank, they married and
their children married until the day when Noah entered the ark. And they
realized the moment of the flood only when it overtook them and carried them
all away; thus it shall be when the Son of Man comes.” (Mt. 24:37-39)

51. “As for that day or hour, no one knows it – neither the angels in heaven,
nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Mk. 13:32)


                                 403

                            Genesis - Chapter XVII


      52. “Verily, verily I say unto you, you will weep and groan, and the world
      will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
      When a mother gives birth, she is in pain because her time has come; but
      after she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the pain because
      of the joy that she has brought a child into the world. Thus it is that you are
      now sorrowful; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no
      one will take your joy from you.” (Jn. 16:20-22)

      53. “Many false prophets will appear and seduce many people; and because
      iniquity will increase, the charity of many will grow cold. But he who
      perseveres until the end will be saved. And this Gospel of the kingdom will
      be proclaimed throughout the earth to serve as a witness to all nations. Then,
      the end will come.” (Mt. 24:11-14)

       54. This portrayal of the end of times is obviously an allegory,
as were most of those that Jesus presented. The powerful images
they contain were of such a nature as to make an impression on
still-undeveloped intelligences. In order to impress such unrefined
imaginations, strongly colored portrayals were necessary. Jesus
mainly addressed the common folk, the less enlightened people
incapable of comprehending metaphysical abstractions and
grasping the subtlety of forms. In order to reach their hearts, he
had to speak to their eyes with the help of physical symbols, and
to their ears through forceful language.
       As a natural consequence of this mental disposition,
the supreme power, according to the current belief, could not
manifest itself except by extraordinary, supernatural means. The
more impossible they were, the more easily they were accepted
as probable.
       The Son of Man coming upon the clouds of heaven in
great majesty and surrounded by his angels and at the sound of
trumpets would have seemed much more powerful to them than a
being clothed only with moral power. Also, the Jews, who expected

                                       404

                       Predictions in the Gospel


the Messiah to be an earthly king who, among all other kings,
would be powerful enough to place their nation on the first level
and to rebuild the throne of David and Solomon, did not want
to acknowledge him in the humble son of a carpenter, with no
physical authority.
      Nevertheless, that poor proletarian from Judea became
the greatest of the great. He conquered more kingdoms for his
kingdom than the most powerful potentates. Solely with his word
and a few poor fishermen he revolutionized the world, and it is to
him that the Jews will owe their restoration. Thus, he spoke the
truth when to Pilate’s question, “Are you a king?” he responded,
“You have said it.”
       55. It should be noted that, among the ancients, earthquakes
and the darkening of the sun were obligatory accessories of all
happenings and foreboding omens; they are found at the deaths
of Jesus and Caesar, and in a multitude of events in the history of
paganism. If such phenomena had occurred as many times as were
reported, it would seem impossible for people not to have retained
a memory of them through tradition. Here the stars that fall from
the sky are added as if to bear witness for future more enlightened
generations that this is only an allegory, because one knows now
that stars cannot fall.
       56. Nonetheless, under such allegories great truths are
hidden. First, there is an announcement about all kinds of
calamities that will strike humankind and decimate it, calamities
resulting from the supreme conflict between good and evil, faith
and disbelief, progressive and regressive ideas. Second, there is the
announcement concerning the spread, throughout the earth, of the
Gospel restored to its original purity, and finally, the announcement
of the kingdom of the good, which will include universal peace,
fraternity and the spreading of the evangelical moral code put into


                                 405

                         Genesis - Chapter XVII


practice by all nations. That truly will be the kingdom of Jesus, for
he will preside over its implementation, and people will live under
the aegis of his law. It will be a kingdom of happiness, because he
said, “After those days of affliction will come days of joy.”
       57. When will such things come true? “No one knows,”
said Jesus, “not even the Son.” However, when the time does come,
people will be forewarned by precursory signs. These signs will be
neither in the sun nor in the stars, but in the social state of affairs
and in phenomena that are more moral than physical, and which
can be partly deduced from his allusions.
       It is quite certain that such a change could not occur during the
apostles’ lifetimes; otherwise, Jesus would not have been ignorant of
that fact. Furthermore, such a transformation could not occur within
just a few years. Nonetheless, he speaks to the disciples as though
they would be witnesses of it. Actually, it is that they would be able
to live again at that time and work for the transformation. Thus, at
times he speaks of the approaching fate of Jerusalem, and at other
times he takes this event as a point of comparison for the future.
       58. Was it really the end of the world that Jesus was
foretelling with his second coming, when he said, “When the
Gospel is preached throughout the earth, then the end will come?”
       It would not be rational to believe that God would destroy
the world at the exact moment in which it entered upon the path
of moral progress through the practice of the evangelical teachings.
Moreover, nothing in Christ’s parables indicates a world-wide
destruction, which under such conditions, would not be justified.
       By leading to an improvement in people’s moral state, the
widespread practice of the Gospel will, by itself, usher in the
kingdom of the good and will cause the collapse of the kingdom
of evil. Thus, it is the end of the old world, the world governed
by prejudice, pride, selfishness, fanaticism, disbelief, greed and all


                                  406

                            Predictions in the Gospel


the evil passions that Christ alluded to when he said, “When the
Gospel is preached throughout the earth, then the end will come.”
However, that end will precipitate a conflict, and it is from such
conflict that the evils that he foresaw will come.

   Your Sons and Daughters Shall Prophesy
      59. “In the last days,” says the Lord, “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;
      your sons and daughters shall prophesy; your young men will have visions and
      your old men shall have dreams. In those days, I will pour out my Spirit upon
      my servants, and they shall prophesy.” (Acts 2:17, 18; Joel 2:28, 29)

       60. If one considers the current state of the physical and
moral worlds, the tendencies, aspirations and presentiments of the
masses, the decay of the ancient beliefs that have struggled in vain for
a century against new ideas, one cannot doubt that a new order of
things is being prepared and that the old world has reached its end.
       If one were to put aside the allegorical aspect of certain
portrayals, and if one were to scrutinize the inner meaning of
Jesus’ words, then by comparing the current situation with the
times he foretold as being signs of an era of renewal, one could not
help but be convinced that many of his predictions are presently
coming true, from which one must conclude that we have reached
the times he announced. This conclusion is being confirmed all
over the globe by the spirits who are manifesting.
       61. As has been seen (chap. I, no. 32), the coming of
Spiritism, coinciding with other events, fulfills one of Jesus’
most important predictions because of the influence that it must
obviously exert on ideas. Furthermore, it is clearly announced in
what is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: “In the last days,” says
the Lord, “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and
daughters shall prophesy.”

                                        407

                             Genesis - Chapter XVII


       This is unmistakably the announcement of the popularization
of mediumship, which is being revealed in our day in individuals
of all ages of both sexes and all walks of life. Consequently, it is a
prediction of the universal manifestation of spirits, because without
spirits there would be no mediums. Thus, it is stated that this will
happen in the last days, and since we have not come to the end of the
world, but rather to the time of its regeneration, one must understand
those words to mean the last days of the moral world that comes to
an end. (See The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. XXI)

                       The Last Judgment
      62. Now, when the Son of Man comes in his majesty, accompanied by all the
      angels, he will sit on the throne of his glory. And all the nations will be gathered
      before him and he will separate some from the others as a shepherd separates the
      sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his
      left. Then, the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by
      my Father,” etc. (Mt. 25:31-46; The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. XV)

       63. Since the good must finally reign on the earth, it will be
necessary to exclude spirits who are hardened in evil and who could
bring trouble to it. God has already allowed them the time needed
for their improvement; but when the time comes in which, through
the moral progress of its inhabitants, the earth must ascend in the
hierarchy of worlds, it will be off limits as a home for incarnates
and discarnates who have not taken advantage of the teachings
they have been in a position to receive there. They will be exiled
to lower worlds as formerly those of the Adamic race were exiled
to the earth, and they will be replaced by better spirits. This is the
separation over which Jesus will preside, and which is portrayed in
these words regarding the Last Judgment, “The good will sit on my
right and the evil on my left.” (See chap. XI, nos. 31 ff.)

                       Predictions in the Gospel


      64. The doctrine of a single, universal final judgment putting
an end to humankind is repugnant to reason in that it implies the
inactivity of God during the eternity that preceded earth’s creation
and during the eternity that will follow its destruction. One might
ask what good the sun, moon and stars will be, which, according
to Genesis, were made to illuminate our world. It is surprising that
such an immense work would have been accomplished for such a
short amount of time and for the benefit of beings, who, for the
most part, were destined beforehand to eternal punishment.
       65. Materially, the idea of a one-time judgment would, to a
certain point, be acceptable to those who do not try to find a reason
for things, and who believe that all humankind is to be found
concentrated on the earth and that everything in the universe
was made for earth’s inhabitants. However, that is unacceptable,
since it is known that there are billions of similar worlds that have
perpetuated humanities throughout eternity, and among which
the earth, as an imperceptible dot, is one of the least impressive.
       One can see by this fact alone that Jesus had a reason for
telling his disciples, “There are many things that I cannot say to
you because you would not understand them,” since the progress
of the sciences would be indispensable for a logical interpretation
of some of his words. Certainly, the apostles – St. Paul and the
first disciples – would have established certain dogmas differently
if they had had the astronomical, geological, physical, chemical,
physiological and psychological knowledge that we possess today.
Moreover, Jesus postponed completing his teachings and declared
that all things would have to be reestablished.
       66. Morally, a final judgment with no possibility of appeal
is irreconcilable with the infinite goodness of the Creator, whom
Jesus ceaselessly presents to us as a good Father, who always leaves
the way open to repentance, and who is always ready to embrace


                                 409

                        Genesis - Chapter XVII


the prodigal son. If Jesus had understood the judgment in that
sense, he would have contradicted his own words.
       Furthermore, if the last judgment is to catch people unprepared
and in the middle of their daily tasks, along with pregnant women,
one would have to ask why God, who does nothing useless or
unjust, would make children be born and create new souls at the
final moment, at the inevitable end of humankind. Would it be to
submit them to judgment upon leaving the maternal womb and
before they had become aware of themselves, while others had had
thousands of years to do so? On which side – right or left – would
such souls, who are not yet either good or evil, be put, but for
whom all roads to final progress would be closed from then on,
since humankind would no longer exist? (See chap. II, no. 19)
       Let those whose reason is content with such beliefs hold on
to them. It is their right and no one should reproach it; but let
them not decry the fact that not everybody shares in their opinion.
       67. By way of emigration – as defined in no. 63 above – the
Judgment is rational; it is founded on the strictest justice, because
it unfailingly leaves the spirit with its own free will; it does not
comprise a special privilege for anyone; equal latitude to evolve
is given by God to all creatures, without exception,. The actual
destruction of a world, causing the destruction of the body, would
not cause any interruption in the spirit’s evolutionary progress.
Such is the consequence of the plurality of worlds and existences.
       According to this interpretation, the description Last
Judgment is not precise, since spirits pass through similar
judgments at each renewal of the worlds they inhabit, until they
have reached a certain degree of purification. Therefore, there is no
Last Judgment per se, but rather general judgments every time there
is a partial or total renewal of world populations, and which give
rise to the great spirit emigrations and immigrations.

            Signs of the Times • The New Generation



                    Signs of the Times
       1. The time set by God has come – we are told everywhere –
in which great events will occur for the regeneration of humankind.
In what sense must these prophetic words be understood? For
disbelievers they hold no importance; to them they are only the
expression of a childish, unfounded belief. For the majority of
believers, they contain something mystical and supernatural that
seems to be the precursor of the upheaval of the laws of nature.
Both interpretations are equally erroneous, however: the former,
because it implies the denial of Providence; the latter, because such
words do not declare the disruption of nature’s laws, but rather
their fulfillment.
       2. Everything in creation is in harmony. Everything reveals
a foresightedness that cannot contradict itself either in the smallest
matters or in the greatest. Thus, right from the start we must
discard all ideas of capriciousness as irreconcilable with the divine
wisdom. Second, if our age has been designated for the fulfillment
of certain things, it is because, in the evolution of the whole, they
have their reason for being.


                                 411

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


       Thus stated, we will say that our globe, like everything else,
is subject to the law of progress. It progresses physically through the
transformation of the elements that compose it, and morally through
the purification of the incarnate and discarnate spirits that populate
it. Both of these areas of progress accompany each other and march
in parallel, because the perfecting of the habitation is in keeping
with the perfecting of the inhabitant. Physically, science has proven
that the globe has undergone transformations that have made it
habitable for beings more and more perfected. Morally, humankind
progresses by the development of intelligence, moral sense and the
softening of customs. While the improvement of the globe occurs
under the control of physical forces, humans participate in it through
the efforts of their intelligence. They cleanse unwholesome regions,
render communication easier and make the earth more productive.
       This dual progress occurs in two ways: one is slow, gradual
and imperceptible; the other by changes that are more abrupt,
each one producing a more rapid ascendant movement which,
by clear signs, marks out the progressive periods of humankind.
These movements, subordinated in the details to human free will,
are somewhat fatalistic as a whole, for they are subject to laws such
as those that operate in the germination, growth and ripening of
plants. This is why the progressive movement is sometimes partial,
that is, limited to one particular race or nation, whereas at other
times it is more generalized.
       Human progress, therefore, is effectuated in virtue of a law;
thus, since all the laws of nature are the eternal work of divine
wisdom and foresight, everything that is the effect of these laws
is the result of God’s will – not an accidental or capricious will,
but an immutable one. Consequently, when humankind is mature
enough to ascend a degree, one can say that the time set by God
has come, just as one can say that in such and such season the time
has come for the ripening of the fruit and the harvest.


                                 412

                        The Time Has Come


       3. From the fact that the progressive movement of
humankind is unavoidable because it is part of nature, it does
not follow that God is indifferent toward it and that after having
established the laws, becomes inactive, leaving things to continue
by themselves. Undoubtedly, God’s laws are eternal and immutable,
but only because God’s will itself is eternal and constant, and
because God’s thought uninterruptedly animates all things. God’s
thought penetrates everything and is the intelligent and ongoing
power that keeps everything harmonious. If this thought were
to cease even for an instant, the universe would be like a clock
without a regulating pendulum. Thus, God incessantly watches
over the execution of the divine laws, and the spirits who populate
space are God’s ministers charged with the details according to the
attributions corresponding to their degree of advancement.
       4. The universe is, at the same time, an unfathomable
mechanism managed by a no-less unfathomable number of
intelligences, an immense government in which each intelligent
being has its part in the action under the watchfulness of the
supreme Lord, whose single will maintains unity everywhere. Under
the rule of this vast regulating power everything moves, everything
functions in perfect order. What to us seem like disturbances are
partial or isolated movements that appear irregular to us only
because our perception is limited. If we could take in the whole,
however, we would see that such irregularities are only apparent
and that they harmonize within the whole.
       5. Up till now, humankind has made incontestable progress.
Due to their intelligence, humans have achieved results never
reached before regarding the sciences, arts and material well-being.
There is much progress yet to be made, however: they have yet to
make charity, fraternity and solidarity reign amongst them in order
to assure their moral well-being. They could achieve this neither


                                413

                         Genesis - Chapter XVIII


with their beliefs nor their antiquated institutions – remnants
from another epoch and good for a certain time – which were
sufficient for a transitory state, but which, after having given what
they could, would be a stopping point today. What people need
nowadays is not only the development of their intelligence but the
elevation of their sentiment, and for this they must do away with
everything that incites their selfishness and pride.
       Such is the age into which we must enter henceforth, and which
will mark one of the principal phases of humankind. This phase,
which is being prepared at this very moment, is the indispensable
supplement to the previous state, just as adulthood is the supplement
to youth. It can thus be foreseen and predicted beforehand, and for
that reason we state that the time set by God has come.
       6. This time, however, will not entail a partial change,
a renewal limited to a certain area, people or race. It will be a
universal movement that will operate in the sense of moral progress.
A new order of things is on the verge of being established, and
those most opposed to it are working for it without even realizing
it. Rid of the dregs of the old world and composed of more-
purified members, the future generation will find itself animated
by different ideas and sentiments than the present generation,
which is disappearing by leaps and bounds. The old world will be
dead and will live in history, like the Medieval Era with its barbaric
customs and superstitious beliefs.
       Furthermore, everybody knows how much the current state
of affairs leaves to be desired. After having more or less exhausted
the material well-being that is the product of intelligence, one
realizes that the supplement to this well-being can only be found
in moral development. The more one advances, the more one
senses what is still lacking, but one cannot define it clearly. It is the
effect of the inner work operating for regeneration; one has desires
and aspirations, which are like the presentiment of a better state.

                                  414

                                       The Time Has Come


       7. However, a change that is as radical as the one being
prepared cannot be accomplished without commotion – there
will be an unavoidable struggle of ideas. From this conflict
temporary disturbances will inevitably arise until the ground
is leveled and equilibrium is reestablished. Consequently, it is
from the struggle of ideas that the foretold grave events will
emerge, and not from purely physical cataclysms or catastrophes.
Widespread cataclysms were the result of the earth’s formation;
nowadays, it is no longer the entrails of the planet that are being
stirred up, but those of humankind.
       8. Even though the earth no longer has to dread widespread
cataclysms, it is nonetheless subject to periodic revolutions, whose
causes from the scientific point of view may be explained in the
following teachings given by two eminent Spirits153:
       “Besides the simple laws that preside over the division of
days and nights, seasons, etc., each heavenly body undergoes
revolutions that require thousands of centuries for their perfect
fulfillment, but which, like shorter revolutions, pass through
all the stages – from birth up to a peak effect, after which there
is a decrease down to the final limit – in order to recommence
afterwards to go through the same phases.
       “Human beings perceive only the phases that are of relatively
short duration, and whose periodicity they can certify. However,
there are some phases that entail many generations of individuals –
even successions of races – and whose effects consequently have
for them the appearance of novelty and spontaneity. However,
if they could look back a few thousand centuries, they would
see, among those same effects and their causes, a correlation that
they do not even suspect. These periods, which confound human

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


imagination due to their relative length, are nevertheless mere
instants in the span of eternity.
        “Within a particular planetary system, all the bodies
comprising it react upon one another. All physical influences are
in solidarity, and there is not one of the effects that you designate
as great disturbances that is not a consequence of the combination
of influences within the entire system.
        “I will state further that planetary systems react upon one
another due to the nearness or distance that results from their
orbital movement through the myriads of systems that compose
our nebula. I will go even further and state that our nebula, which
is like an archipelago in the immensity of space, with its orbital
movement through the myriads of nebulae, is subject to the
influence of those it nears.
        “Hence, nebulae react upon nebulae and systems react upon
systems, just as planets react upon planets and the elements of
each planet react one upon another, and thus successively down
to the atom. Hence, on each world, there are local or widespread
revolutions that do not appear to be disturbances because the
brevity of life allows only for the perception of partial effects.
        “Organic matter cannot escape these influences. The
disturbances that it undergoes can thus alter the physical state of
living beings and cause some of those diseases that generally attack
plants, animals and humans. Such diseases, like all scourges, are
stimuli that, out of necessity, drive the human mind to find means
to combat them and to discover the laws of nature.
        “Organic matter, however, reacts in turn upon the spirit. The
spirit, due to its contact and inner connection with the physical
elements, is also subject to influences that modify its dispositions –
although they do not deprive it of its free will – and overexcite or
attenuate its activity, thereby contributing to its development. The
turmoil that sometimes manifests within an entire population among


                                 416

                           The Time Has Come


the people of the same race is not a fortuitous event, nor is it the result
of a capricious act; its cause lies in the laws of nature. Unconscious
at first, this turmoil, which is nothing more than a vague desire,
an indefinable yearning for something better, a need for change, is
expressed through silent agitation, and then through actions that
prepare social revolutions, which, believe it or not, also have their
own lifespan, similar to physical revolutions, because everything is
connected. If your spirit sight were not limited by the veil of matter, you
would see these fluidic currents, which, like thousands of conductor
wires, link up the things of the spirit world and the physical world.
        “When you hear that humankind has arrived at a period of
transformation and that the earth must ascend within the world
hierarchy, do not see anything mystical in these words, but, to the
contrary, the fulfillment of one of the great unavoidable laws of the
universe, against which all human ill will shall break.”
                                                                    Arago
       9. “Yes indeed, humankind is being transformed just as it
has been transformed in other epochs, and each transformation
is marked by a turning point, which, for the human species, is
what the turning point in growth is for the individual; these crises,
frequently painful and dolorous, carry generations and institutions
along with them, but are always followed by a phase of material
and moral progress.
       “After nearly a century, earth’s humanity has arrived at one
of these growth periods and is in the middle of a transformative
endeavor; that is why humankind is being shaken on all sides,
caught up in a kind of fever as if driven by an invisible power until
it is settled on new foundations. Whoever sees it afterward will
find many changes in its customs, its character, its laws and its
beliefs; in other words, in its entire societal aspect.
       “One thing that might seem strange to you, but which
nevertheless is strictly true, is that the spirit world that surrounds

                                   417

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


you feels the repercussions of all the turmoil that disturbs the
world of incarnates: I would even say that it plays an active part.
This should come as no surprise to those who know that spirits
make up part of humanity; that they come from humankind and
must return to it. Consequently, it is natural that they would have
an interest in the movements that occur among human beings.
You can be sure, therefore, that when a social revolution occurs on
the earth, it also impacts the invisible world; all the good and evil
passions become overexcited there just as they do amongst you. An
unspoken turbulence reigns among the spirits who still make up
part of your world, and who await the time to return to it.
       “To the disturbances of incarnates and discarnates,
sometimes – very frequently, actually, since everything in nature
is linked together – are added the disturbances of the physical
elements. Then, for a while, there is a true widespread confusion
that passes like a hurricane, but after which the sky returns to being
serene, and humankind, reconstituted upon new foundations and
imbued with new ideas, enters a new phase on the road of progress.
       “It is in the period that has just opened that one will see
Spiritism flourish and bring forth fruit. Therefore, it is for
the future more than for the present that you labor; but it was
necessary for these labors to be prepared beforehand, because they
trace out the pathways of regeneration through the unification and
rationality of beliefs. Fortunate are they who take advantage of
them as of today; they will spare themselves as many sorrows as
they will gain in benefits.”

       10. From the preceding, one may conclude that, as a result
of their orbital movement through space, heavenly bodies exert
a lesser or greater influence on one another, depending on their
proximity and their respective position; that this influence can
cause a momentary disturbance in their constitutive elements and

                                 418

                                     The Time Has Come


alter the living conditions of their inhabitants; that the regularity
of their movements will determine the periodic return of the same
causes and effects; that the length of certain periods is too short
to be perceivable to humans, whereas other periods see whole
generations and even races pass away without being perceived, and
for whom the state of things seems normal. On the other hand,
generations that are contemporaneous with the transition feel its
repercussions and everything seems to part from ordinary laws.
Such generations see a supernatural, extraordinary and miraculous
cause in what is in reality the fulfillment of the laws of nature.
       If through the linkage and solidarity of causes and effects the
periods of humankind’s moral renewals coincide – as everything
would lead us to believe – with the physical revolutions of the
globe, such periods may be accompanied or preceded by natural
phenomena that are unusual to those not familiar with them, by
meteors that seem strange, or by an unusual recrudescence and
intensity of destructive calamities. These calamities are neither a
cause nor supernatural omens, but a consequence of the general
movement occurring in both the physical and moral world.
       By foretelling the age of renewal that will open up for
humankind and mark the end of the old world, Jesus was able to
say that it would be characterized by extraordinary movements,
earthquakes, various calamities and signs in the sky – which are
nothing more than meteors – without derogating from the laws
of nature. The uneducated common folk, however, saw in these
words the announcement of miraculous events.154

      The terrible epidemic that devastated the population of Maurice Island from 1866 to
      1868 was preceded in November of 1866 by a shower of falling stars so extraordinary
      and abundant that its inhabitants were terrified. It was from that moment on that the
      sickness that had developed quite benignly for a few months became a truly devastating
      calamity. This was undoubtedly a sign in the sky, and it is perhaps in this sense that one
      must understand the stars falling from the sky spoken about in the Gospel as one of the
      signs of the times. (For details about the Maurice Island epidemic, see Revue Spirite, Jul.
      1867, p. 208; Nov. 1868, p. 321) – Auth.

       11. Foreseeing the progressive movements of humankind
holds nothing surprising for dematerialized beings, who can see
the objective toward which all things are headed, some of whom
even possess God’s direct thought, and who discern in partial
movements the time in which a general movement can occur,
just as one can determine beforehand the time needed for a tree
to bear fruit, or as astronomers can calculate the timing of an
astronomical phenomenon by the time it takes for a heavenly
body to complete its orbit.
      12. Humankind is a collective being in which the same moral
revolutions occur in each individual being, with the difference that
some occur from year to year; others, from century to century. If
one were to follow humankind in its evolution through time, one
would see the life of many races marked out by periods that give
each epoch a particular physiognomy.
       13. As we have stated, the forward progress of humankind
occurs in two ways: one is gradual, slow and imperceptible if one
considers consecutive eras that result in successive improvements in
customs, laws and usages, and which cannot be perceived except over
time such as the changes that water currents bring to the surface of
the globe; the other is marked by relatively abrupt, quick movements
similar to those of a torrent breaking the dikes, and which in a few
years cover the space that would have otherwise taken centuries.
Then, there is a moral cataclysm that in a few moments swallows up
the institutions of the past and is succeeded by a new order of things
that stabilizes little by little as peace is definitively restored.
       Those who live long enough to stand on both sides of
the new phase will think that a new world has arisen from the
ruins of the old. The character, customs and usages – everything
has changed. Actually, what has occurred is that new humans –
or rather, regenerated ones – have appeared. The ideas of the

                           The Time Has Come


generation that has passed away have given way to the new ideas
of the generation that has arisen.
        14. Having reached adulthood, humankind will have
new needs and greater and higher aspirations. It will understand
the emptiness of the ideas in which it had been cradled and the
inability of its institutions to bring happiness; it will no longer
find in the current state of affairs the true satisfaction to which it
feels it has been called. Consequently, it will rid itself of its childish
ways, and driven by an irresistible force, will launch itself toward
unknown shores in search of new, less limited horizons.
        It is at one of these periods of transformation, or if you prefer,
of moral growth, that humankind has arrived. From adolescence it
has reached adulthood. The past is no longer sufficient for its new
aspirations, its new necessities. It can no longer be led by the same
means. It can no longer treat itself with illusions and deceptions. Its
mature reason requires more substantial nourishment. The present
is too ephemeral; it feels that its destiny is much vaster and that
corporeal life is too restrictive to contain it completely. That is why
its gaze probes both the past and the future in order to discover the
mystery of its existence and to draw from it a sure consolation.
        It is in the moment in which humankind finds itself too
confined within its material sphere – where intellectual life overflows
and where the sentiment of spirituality blooms – that the individuals
who call themselves philosophers hope to fill the vacuum with
doctrines of nihilism and materialism! A strange aberration! These
same individuals claim to be driving humankind forward, yet they
make every effort to contain it in the narrow circle of matter, from
which it aspires to escape. They bar it from the aspect of infinite life,
and pointing at the grave, tell it: Nec plus ultra!
     15. Those who have meditated on Spiritism and its
consequences, and have not restricted it to the sphere of producing


                                   421

                         Genesis - Chapter XVIII


a few phenomena, understand that it opens up a new pathway to
humankind and discloses the horizons of the infinite. By initiating
them into the mysteries of the invisible world, it shows them its
true role in creation, a role that is continually active both in the spirit
state and in the corporeal. Humans no longer walk in blindness:
they know where they have come from, where they are going and
why they are on the earth. The future shows itself to them as it
really is, freed of the prejudices of ignorance and superstition; it
is no longer a vague hope: it is a tangible truth as certain as day
follows night. They know that their being is not limited to a few
moments of an ephemeral existence; that the life of the spirit is
not interrupted by death; that they have lived before and will live
again, and that from all they acquire in perfection through labor,
nothing is lost. In their previous lives they find the reason for what
they are today, and from what they make of themselves today, they can
deduce what they will be tomorrow.
       16. According to the idea that individual activity and
cooperation in the overall work of civilization are limited to the
present life, that a person was nothing before and will be nothing
afterward, what does the ultimate progress of humankind matter
to people? What does it matter that in the future peoples will be
better-governed, happier, more enlightened and kinder toward
one another? Since they will not be able to take advantage of it,
is not such progress lost to them? What good does it do them to
labor for those who will come after them if they will never know
them, if they are new individuals, who soon thereafter will go back
into nothingness themselves? Under the domain of the denial that
the individual has a future, everything necessarily shrinks to the
petty proportions of the moment and the personality.
       On the other hand, however, what breadth the certainty that
the spiritual being will live forever gives to human thought! What
could be more rational, more grandiose, more worthy of the Creator

                                   422

                         The Time Has Come


than the law according to which the spirit life and the corporeal life
are only two modes of existence that alternate for the fulfillment
of progress! What could be more just and more consoling than
the idea of the same individuals progressing incessantly, first by
being born through generations on the same world, and then on
world after world, without dissolution of continuity, until they reach
perfection! Then, all their actions have a purpose, for while they
are working for the whole, they are working for themselves and for
each other in a way that neither individual nor general progress is
ever fruitless. It benefits future generations and individuals, who
are none other than past generations and individuals who have
now arrived at a higher degree of advancement.
       17. Fraternity must be the cornerstone of the new social
order; however, there can be no true, solid and effective fraternity
unless it rests upon an unshakable foundation; that foundation is
faith; not faith in these or those particular dogmas, which change
with the times and peoples who cast stones at one another – because
by anathematizing one another, they feed hostility – but faith in
the fundamental principles that everyone can accept: God, the soul,
the future, THE ONGOING PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUALS
AND THE PERPETUITY OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG
THEM. When all people are convinced that God is the same for
all; that this supremely just and good God cannot want anything
unjust; that evil comes from humans and not from God, then they
will regard one another as children of the same Father and will
shake hands with one another.
       This is the faith that Spiritism provides, and which will be
from hereon out the pivot around which humankind will move,
whatever the mode of worship and the particular creed may be.
     18. The intellectual progress accomplished so far in vast
proportions is a huge step and has marked the first phase of


                                 423

                          Genesis - Chapter XVIII


humankind; by itself, however, it has been powerless to regenerate
it. As long as humans are dominated by pride and selfishness, they
will use their intelligence and knowledge to satisfy their passions
and personal interests, which is why they apply themselves to
perfecting ways of harming and destroying their neighbor.
       19. Only moral progress can assure people of happiness on
the earth by restraining evil passions. It alone can enable harmony,
peace and fraternity to reign.
       Moral progress will break down the barriers that separate
peoples, and will bring down class prejudices and silence the
antagonism between sects, teaching people to regard one another
as brothers and sisters who are called to mutually help one another
and not live at one another’s expense.
       Moreover, it is moral progress, aided by the progress of intelligence,
that will join people together in one and the same belief founded on
inarguable eternal truths, and, consequently, acceptable to all.
       Unity of belief will be the most powerful bond, the solidest
foundation of universal fraternity, which has been shattered throughout
history by the religious hostilities that have divided peoples and
families, making them see dissidents as enemies to be avoided, fought
against and exterminated, instead of brothers and sisters to be loved.
       20. Such a state of affairs presupposes a radical change in
the sentiment of the masses, a generalized progress that cannot
be accomplished except by quitting the circle of the narrow and
petty ideas that foster selfishness. At different periods in time,
elite individuals sought to drive humankind along that path, but
humankind, still quite young, remained deaf, and their teachings
became the good seed that fell on the rocky soil.
       Today, humankind is mature enough to set its sights
higher than it ever has in order to assimilate broader ideas and to
comprehend what it did not comprehend before.


                                    424

                         The Time Has Come


      The generation that disappears will take its errors and
prejudices with it; the generation that emerges, immersed in a
purer source and imbued with more sound ideas, will imprint on
the world an ascendant movement in the sense of moral progress,
which will signal the new phase for humankind.
       21. This phase is already being revealed by unmistakable
signs, by attempts at useful reforms and by great and generous ideas
that have been brought to light and which have begun to find an
echo. Thus it is that we have seen the founding of a great number
of protective, civilizing and liberating institutions under the
impetus and by the initiative of individuals obviously predestined
for the work of regeneration; that penal laws are imbued every day
with a more humane sentiment. Race prejudices are weakening
and peoples have begun to regard themselves as members of a
great family, and through the uniformity and ease of the means of
transaction, they are overcoming the barriers that have separated
them. From all parts of the world they are coming together in
universal assemblies for the peaceful exchange of thoughts.
       However, these reforms lack a foundation in order to be
developed, completed and consolidated, a more generalized moral
predisposition to yield good results and become accepted by the
masses. This is nothing more than a characteristic sign of the
times, the prelude to what will be accomplished on a much larger
scale as the ground becomes more favorable.
      22. Another sign no less characteristic of the period into
which we are entering is the obvious reaction occurring in the
sense of spiritualistic ideas; an instinctive rejection is manifesting
against materialistic ideas. The spirit of disbelief, which seized
both the ignorant and enlightened masses and led them to reject,
along with the form, the very foundation of every belief, seems to
have been a deep sleep, the awakening from which stirs the need


                                 425

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


to breathe a more vivifying air. And where emptiness is felt, people
unconsciously seek something, a point of support, a hope.
      23. Believing that most people are imbued with such
sentiments, one can easily imagine the changes that would occur
in social relations: charity, fraternity and benevolence toward
all and tolerance for all beliefs will be their motto. This is the
objective toward which humankind is obviously headed, the
object of its aspirations and desires, without it being fully aware of
the means of fulfilling them. It experiments and feels around, but
is hampered by active resistance or the strength of inertia caused
by prejudices and stationary beliefs that are stubbornly resistant to
progress. Such are the obstacles that must be overcome, and this
will be the task of the new generation. By following the present
course of things, one can see that everything seems predestined to
open the way for it. The new generation will hold the dual power
of numbers and ideas, in addition to the experience of the past.
       24. The new generation will thus march toward the
fulfillment of all the humanitarian ideas compatible with the degree
of advancement at which it will have arrived. With Spiritism going
forward with the same goal and accomplishing its purposes, both
will meet on the same ground. Progressive individuals will find
in Spiritist ideas a powerful lever, and Spiritism will find in these
new individuals minds entirely predisposed to accept it. Given this
state of affairs, what could those who wish to oppose it do?
       25. It was not Spiritism that created social renewal; it was
the maturity of humankind that made such renewal a necessity.
Through its moralizing power, its progressive tendencies, the
breadth of its outlook and the generality of the issues it encompasses,
Spiritism is more capable than any other doctrine to aid the
regenerative movement; this is why Spiritism is contemporaneous
with it. Spiritism appeared on the scene at the time in which it


                                 426

                         The Time Has Come


could be most useful, because its time has also come. If it had come
any sooner it would have run up against insurmountable obstacles.
It would have succumbed inevitably, because, satisfied with what
they already had, people would not have felt the need for what
Spiritism offers. Today, born with the movement of the ideas that
are brewing, it has found the ground prepared to receive it. Owing
to doubt and uncertainty, and frightened by the open abyss before
them, spirits welcome Spiritism as an anchor of salvation and a
supreme consolation.
      26. Of course, the number of stragglers is quite large, but
what can they do against the tide that is mounting except throw a
few pebbles at it? This tide is the generation that is now appearing,
whereas the former are disappearing with the generation that is
decaying every day in large strides. Until then, however, they will
defend their ground tooth and nail; thus, there is an unavoidable
yet unequal struggle, because it is the decrepit past falling to pieces
against the youthful future; of stagnation against progress; of the
individual against God’s will, because the time set by God has come.

                  The New Generation
       27. In order for people to be happy on the earth it must be
populated only by good incarnate and discarnate spirits who desire
nothing but the good. Once such a time has come, there will be a
great emigration from among those who inhabit the earth. Those
who practice evil for evil’s sake, and who are untouched by the
sentiment of the good, will no longer be worthy of the transformed
planet. They will be banished from it, because their stay would
once more cause trouble and confusion and would be an obstacle to
progress. Some will expiate their hardness of heart on less evolved
worlds. Others will do so among primitive races here on earth,


                                 427

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


which will be the same as expiating on less evolved worlds. These
will bring with them the knowledge they have acquired and will
have the mission of enabling these races to advance. They will be
replaced by more-advanced spirits, who will see to it that justice,
peace and fraternity reign.
       According to the Spirits, the earth will not be transformed
by a cataclysm that will suddenly wipe out an entire generation.
The current generation will disappear gradually and the new one
will follow it in the same way, without there having been any
change in the natural order of things.
       Consequently, everything will proceed outwardly as usual,
but with this single difference – a crucial one: a portion of the
spirits who used to incarnate on the earth will no longer do so.
Instead of a backward spirit inclined toward evil and who would
have incarnated in a child being born, there will be a more advanced
spirit with a propensity for the good.
       Thus, it does not so much involve a new corporeal
generation, but rather a new generation of spirits; this is what
Jesus undoubtedly meant when he said, “Verily, verily I say unto
you that this generation will not pass away until these events
have been fulfilled.” Consequently, those who hope to see the
transformation occur by means of supernatural and extraordinary
effects will be disappointed.
       28. The present age is one of transition; the members of
both generations are mixed together. Standing at the mid point,
we are watching the departure of one and the arrival of the other,
and each is already distinguishable by the characteristics that are
proper to it.
       These two generations hold ideas and views that are
complete opposites. By the nature of their moral dispositions –
but especially their intuitive and innate dispositions – it is easy to
tell to which of the two each individual belongs.

                                 428

                         The Time Has Come


       Charged with founding the age of moral progress, the new
generation is distinguishable by an overall precocious intelligence
and reason combined with an innate sentiment of the good and
spiritualist beliefs – an unmistakable sign of a certain degree of
previous advancement. Consequently, it will not be composed
exclusively of eminently high order spirits, but of those who, having
already progressed, are predisposed to assimilating progressive
ideas and are capable of upholding the regenerative movement.
       On the other hand, what distinguishes less evolved spirits
is primarily their rebelliousness against God by refusing to
acknowledge any power superior to human power, and their
instinctive propensity for the degrading passions and the anti-
fraternal sentiments of selfishness, pride, envy and jealousy; in
other words, their attachment to everything material: sensuality,
ambition and greed.
       These are the vices of which earth must be purged by the
banishment of those who refuse to mend their ways, for they are
incompatible with the reign of fraternity, and moral individuals
will always suffer a great deal in contact with them. When the earth
is freed from them, people will progress without obstacles toward
the better future that is reserved for them in this world as a reward
for their efforts and perseverance while waiting a more complete
purification to open the way for them to higher order worlds.
       29. By this emigration of spirits, one must not understand
it to mean that all stragglers will be banished from the earth and
relegated to less evolved worlds. On the contrary, many will come
back to earth because many have given in to the driving force of
circumstances and examples – their outer layer is worse than their
core. Once they are removed from the influence of matter and the
prejudices of the corporeal world, most of them will see things
much differently than when they were alive – we have seen many
examples of this. They will be aided by benevolent spirits who take

                                429

                       Genesis - Chapter XVIII


an interest in them, and who will hasten to enlighten and show them
the erroneous path that they have followed. Through our prayers
and exhortations we ourselves can contribute to their improvement,
because there is continuous unity between the dead and the living.
       The way in which the transformation is occurring is quite
simple, and as we have seen, it is completely of a moral character
and in no way derogates from the laws of nature.
       30. Whether the spirits of the new generation are new,
more-evolved spirits, or whether they are old spirits who have
evolved, the result is the same. From the moment they display
better dispositions, there is always a renewal. Thus, incarnate
spirits form two categories according to their natural dispositions:
on one hand are the stragglers who leave, and, on the other, the
progressive spirits who arrive. The state of customs and society,
whether in a people, a race or an entire world, will therefore be
the result of which of the two classes will be the preponderant one.
      31. An ordinary comparison will provide an even better
comprehension of what happens in such a circumstance. Let us
imagine a regiment composed mostly of unruly and undisciplined
men who are constantly causing disorder, and the severity of the
penal law often has difficulty restraining it. These men are the
strongest because they are the most numerous. They support,
encourage and incite one another by example. The few good
men have no influence; their advice is scorned; they are ridiculed,
mistreated by the others and suffer in their company. Is this not a
picture of today’s society?
      Let us suppose that the men of this regiment are taken one
by one, ten by ten, a hundred by a hundred and are replaced at
the same rate by an equal number of good soldiers, even some
who had been expelled but who have truly mended their ways
since then. After some time, the regiment will be the same one,


                                430

                           The Time Has Come


but it will have been transformed. Good order will have followed
disorder. This is how it will be with a regenerated humanity.
        32. The great collective departures are not meant only to activate
exits, but to transform the mind of the masses more rapidly by freeing it
from evil influences and lending greater ascendancy to new ideas.
        It is because many, in spite of their imperfections, are ripe
for such a transformation, that many depart in order to retemper
themselves in a purer source. As long as they had remained in the
same environment and under the same influences, they would have
persisted in their old ideas and their ways of looking at things. One
stay in the spirit world is enough to open their eyes, because there
they can see what they could not on earth. Disbelievers, fanatics
and absolutists consequently will be able to return with inborn
ideas of faith, tolerance and liberty. Upon their return they will
find that things have changed and will experience the influence of
the new environment into which they have been born. Instead of
opposing new ideas, they will support them.
       33. The regeneration of humankind, therefore, does not
absolutely require spirits to be completely renewed; a modification
in their moral outlook is sufficient. This modification occurs in all
those who are predisposed to it once they are removed from the
pernicious influences of the world. Thus, those who come back to
earth are not always other spirits, but frequently the same ones,
who now think and feel in a different way.
       When isolated and individual, this improvement goes unnoticed
and has no ostensive influence in the world. Quite different is the
effect when it takes place simultaneously among large masses, because
then, according to the proportions it assumes in one generation, the
ideas of a people or a race can be profoundly modified.
       That is what is almost always noticed after the large shocks
that decimate populations. Destructive scourges destroy only


                                   431

                        Genesis - Chapter XVIII


bodies – they do not touch the spirit. They activate the coming-
and-going movement between the corporeal and spirit worlds,
and, consequently, the progressive movement of incarnate and
discarnate spirits. It should be noted that throughout the epochs of
history, great social crises have been followed by an era of progress.
       34. It is one of these widespread movements that is
occurring at present, and which will usher in the reorganization
of humankind. The increase in the causes of destruction is a
characteristic sign of the times, for they will hasten the emergence
of new prototypes. They are the leaves that fall in autumn and
which are followed by other leaves full of life, for humankind has
its own seasons, just as individuals go through their various stages
of life. The dead leaves of humankind fall stricken by blasts and
blows from the wind only to be reborn more alive under the same
breath of life, which is not extinguished but purified.
       35. For materialists, destructive scourges are calamities
without compensation, without beneficial results, since in their
opinion such calamities wipe out beings forever. For those, however,
who know that death only destroys the envelope, such calamities
do not carry the same consequences and they do not cause them the
least bit of fear. They understand the purpose of such calamities,
and they also know that people do not lose any more by dying
together than by dying alone, because, in one way or the other, it
is always necessary to come to this end.
       Disbelievers will laugh at these things and will treat them
as chimeras; however, say what they may, they will not escape the
common law. They will fall in their turn just like everyone else,
and then what will become of them? They say, “Nothing!” But they
will continue to live on in spite of themselves, and will someday be
forced to open their eyes.

          Today they believe and their faith is unshakable, because it is based
          on evidence and demonstration, and because it satisfies reason.
          […] Such is the faith of Spiritists, and the proof of their strength is
          that they endeavor to make themselves better, to control their evil
          inclinations and to put into practice Christ’s maxims, regarding
          all humans as brothers and sisters regardless of race, caste, or sect,
          forgiving their enemies and repaying evil with good in accordance
          with the divine model. (KARDEC, Allan. Revue Spirite, 1868).

       A strictly rational and scientific study of facts that revealed
the communication of human beings with spirits, accomplished by
Allan Kardec, resulted in the codification of the Spiritist Doctrine,
which was systematized according to scientific, philosophical and
religious aspects.
       Beginning in 1854 and lasting until his death in 1869,
Kardec’s endeavor was comprised of five basic works: The Spirits’
Book (1857), The Mediums’ Book (1861), The Gospel according
to Spiritism (1864), Heaven and Hell (1865) and Genesis (1868),
in addition to the book What is Spiritism (1859) and a series of
booklets and 136 editions of Revue Spirite (Jan. 1858 – Apr. 1869).
After his death, the book Posthumous Works was compiled (1890).

    Publisher’s note: This “Explanatory Note”, published due to an agreement with the
    Brazilian Federal Department of Justice (Ministério Público Federal), is intended to
    demonstrate the absence of any discrimination or prejudice in certain passages of the
    works of Allan Kardec, which are all characterized by upholding the principles of Christian
    fraternity and solidarity contained in the Spiritist Doctrine.



                                              433

                            Explanatory Note


        A meticulous and unrestrained study of these works will
enable us to extract a number of basic conclusions: a) all human
beings are immortal spirits created by God under equal conditions,
subject to the same natural laws of progress that gradually lead all
to perfection; b) progress occurs by means of successive experiences
in innumerable reincarnations necessarily encompassing all
social classes, which is the only way the spirit can accumulate the
learning experience needed for its development; c) in the period
between reincarnations the spirit lives in the spirit world and can
communicate with humans; d) progress obeys the moral laws taught
and lived by Jesus, our guide and model, who is the reference for all
people who desire to evolve consciously and intentionally.
        At several points in his work, the Codifier refers to spirits who
have incarnated in uneducated and primitive tribes that existed
at the time in a few regions of the planet, and that, in contact
with other segments of civilization, were undergoing innumerable
transformations – many of which were obviously beneficial for
their members – resulting from the general progress to which all
ethnicities are subject, regardless of the color of their skin.
        In Kardec’s time the phrenological ideas of Gall and the
physiognomic ideas of Lavater were accepted by eminent scientists.
Also, the publication in 1859 – two years after the release of The
Spirits’ Book – of Charles Darwin’s book The Evolution of Species,
containing the natural misconceptions and misunderstandings
that every new science entails, caused enormous excitement in the
means of communication within the scholarly community and the
general population. Furthermore, the belief that facial traits reveal
the character of an individual is ancient and implies that there is an
apparent relationship between one’s physical and moral bearing.
        The Codifier did not agree with many aspects presented by
these so-called sciences. Thus, he tried to appraise the conclusions
of such eminent scholars in the light of the Spirits’ revelation,


                                  434

                            Explanatory Note


bringing to the discussion the spiritual element as the decisive factor
in resolving the issues regarding human diversity and inequality.
       In the principles of the Spiritist Doctrine, Kardec found
explanations that point to wise and supreme laws, which is why
he affirmed that Spiritism enables “… the solving of thousands of
historical, archeological, anthropological, theological, psychological,
moral, social, etc. problems” (Revue Spirite, 1862). In fact, the
universal laws of love, charity, immortality of the soul, reincarnation
and evolution comprise new parameters for understanding the
development of human groups in the many regions of the planet.
       This understanding of the Divine Laws allowed Kardec to state:

      The body proceeds from the body, but the spirit does not proceed
      from the spirit. There is no other link than blood kinship among
      descendants. (The Spirits’ Book, no. 207)
      […] Spiritism, restoring to the spirit its true role in creation by
      demonstrating the superiority of the mind over matter, naturally
      puts an end to all the established distinctions among human
      beings according to bodily and worldly advantages, upon which
      pride alone founded castes and the stupid prejudices of color.
      (Revue Spirite, 1861)
      The privileges of race have their origin in the abstraction that
      humans normally make of the spiritual principle by taking
      only the outward physical being into consideration. From the
      constitutional strength or weakness of some, the difference in color
      of others, the birth into wealth or poverty, and noble or plebian
      blood kinship, they concluded that there is a natural superiority
      or inferiority. Upon such data they based their social laws and race
      privileges. From this limited point of view – for they take only the
      physical life into consideration – certain classes seem to belong –
      and really do belong – to different races. However, if they would
      take their point of view from the spiritual being, the essential

     and progressive being, i.e. the spirit, preexistent to and surviving
     everything and whose body is nothing more than a temporary
     envelope that varies like clothing in shape and color; moreover,
     if from the study of spirit beings proves that such beings are of
     an identical nature and origin, that their destiny is the same and
     that all take their departure from the same point and tend toward
     the same objective; that corporeal life is nothing more than one
     incident, one of the phases in the life of the spirit, and necessary
     for its intellectual and moral advancement; that in light of this
     advancement the spirit may successively clothe itself in many
     different envelopes, be born into different situations, then they
     would arrive at the crucial consequence of equality of nature, and
     from there, the equality of social rights for all human individuals
     and the abolition of race privileges. This is what Spiritism teaches.
     You who deny the existence of the spirit in order to consider only
     the corporeal individual, the continuation of the intelligent being
     in order to look only at the present life, you deny the sole principle
     upon which the equality of rights that you demand for yourselves
     and your fellow beings is rightly founded. (Revue Spirite, 1867)
     With reincarnation, race and caste prejudices collapse, since the
     same spirit can be reborn rich or poor, great lord or proletarian, boss
     or subordinate, free or slave, male or female. Of all the arguments
     against the injustice of servitude and slavery, against the subjugation of
     women to the law of the mightiest, there are none that logically prevail
     over the material fact of reincarnation. Therefore, if reincarnation rests
     upon a law of nature – the principle of universal fraternity – it also
     rests upon the law of the equality of social rights and, consequently, of
     liberty. (Genesis, chap. I, no. 36. See also Revue Spirite, 1867)

     At the time, Kardec knew only what various authors wrote
about African primitives, who were always reduced to nearly
complete animality when they were not mercilessly enslaved.

      It was based on this “scientific” information of the time that,
using other words, the Codifier repeated what European scholars
described upon returning from their journeys to Black Africa.
However, it was crucial that he address the issue of racial prejudice:

      We labor to give faith to those who believe in nothing; to spread a
      belief that encourages them to behave better toward one another,
      which teaches them to forgive their enemies and to regard each
      other as brothers and sisters without distinction of race, caste,
      sect, color or political or religious opinion; in other words, a belief
      that gives birth to the true sentiment of charity, fraternity and
      social duty. (Revue Spirite, Jan. 1863)
      Moral persons are kind, humane and benevolent toward all
      regardless of race or creed, because they regard all people as their
      brothers and sisters. (The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap.
      XVII, no. 3)

       It is also important to understand that the texts published
by Kardec in Revue Spirite were intended to submit to general
scrutiny the communications received from spirits, as well as to
compare their teachings with the theories and systems of thought
in force at the time. In a footnote in chapter XI, number 43 of the
book Genesis, the Codifier explains this methodology:

      In the January 1862 issue of Revue Spirite, when we published
      an article on the interpretation of the doctrine of the fallen angels,
      we presented this theory as a hypothesis, with no other authority
      than that of a debatable personal opinion, because, at the time,
      we lacked elements sufficiently complete for an absolute assertion.
      We put it out as a trial essay, seeking to elicit examination of
      the issue, fully determined to abandon it or modify it if need
      be. Today, however, this theory has endured the test of universal


                                   437

      control. It has not only been accepted by the majority of Spiritists
      as the most rational and most in agreement with God’s justice,
      but has also been confirmed by most of the instructions given by
      the Spirits on the subject. The same applies to the origin of the
      Adamic race. (Genesis, chap. XI, no. 43)

       Finally, one must realize that the principal scope of the
Spiritist Doctrine lies in the moral perfection process of the human
being, which is the reason why scientific and/or philosophical
investigation and examination occupy a secondary, although
important, position, considering their provisory character resulting
from overall progress and improvement. In this sense the Codifier’s
warning is justified:

      It is true that this and other issues lie outside the moral point of
      view, which is the essential goal of Spiritism. Hence, it would be
      a mistake to make them the object of constant preoccupation.
      Moreover, with respect to the principle of things, we know that
      since spirits do not know everything, they speak only of what they
      know or what they think they know. However, since there are
      persons who might draw from the divergence of these theories an
      induction against the unity of Spiritism precisely because they have
      been formulated by the Spirits, it is useful to be able to compare
      the reasons for and against, in the interest of the Doctrine itself,
      and to support on the basis of the majority the judgment that
      may be made as to the worth of certain communications. (Revue
      Spirite, 1862)

       In light of the above considerations, one must conclude that
in the Spiritist Doctrine absolute respect is rendered to human
diversity, and it is the Spiritist’s responsibility to cooperate in the
progress of humankind by practicing charity in its most far-reaching

sense (“benevolence toward all, indulgence for others’ imperfections
and the forgiveness of offenses), just as Jesus, our Guide and Model,
taught, without prejudices of any kind as to color, ethnicity, gender,
creed or economic, social or moral standing.
