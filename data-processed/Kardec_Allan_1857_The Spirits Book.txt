          TRANSLATORS’ PREFACE TO
            THE THIRD EDITION

       This third edition is a further refinement of the second
edition, which was a thorough revision of the first. Since the
publication of the first edition, we have translated and the I.S.C.
has published the first editions of the other volumes of the Spiritist
Codification – The Mediums’ Book (2006), Heaven and Hell (2006),
The Gospel according to Spiritism (2008) and Genesis (2009) – as
well as the additional work What is Spiritism? (2010), and they will
be revised as new editions are published.
       In the first two editions, we made a few comments about how
we approached a number of grammatical issues and we will reiterate
them here. The authoritative French version was published in 1857,
nearly 150 years ago. Apart from the challenge of translating from
one language into another and overcoming the structural differences
between the two, there were other challenges involving the time
period differential. The first and greatest of these challenges was the
problem of gender-neutral language. When referring to individuals,
we addressed the problem by using plural pronouns as much as
possible because they are gender-­neutral, rather than the singular
pronoun combinations he or she, him or her, his or her. When
referring to a single spirit or soul, the neuter pronoun it was used,
since, technically, spirits are sexless, though sometimes the singular

                                  13

                            Translators’ Preface


form was changed to the plural; nevertheless, we used the personal
relative pronouns who and whom when referring to a single spirit or
soul. Masculine pronouns were eliminated when referring to God,
because Spiritism does not hold to the idea that God should be
personified; God is viewed as the First Cause (see question no.1),
who works in creation strictly through established natural laws.
Thus, the proper noun God was used to replace the pronouns. In
other instances, the singular man and all of its related pronouns were
usually changed by employing the plural humans, human beings,
individuals, etc., which were also used to replace the plural men.
       Our main goal was to hold as closely to Kardec’s original as
possible without producing either a transliteration or a paraphrase,
which is why we retained as many original terms as possible and
adhered to the original style as much as the grammatical and
structural differences between the two languages would allow.
       This edition also includes Anna Blackwell’s Preface to her
version, which has served the English public since the 19th century.
Her Preface contains a short biography of Allan Kardec, but we
have modified it slightly by updating it into modern English.
       We suggest that the reader who may be unfamiliar with
Spiritism as coined and codified by Allan Kardec begin by perusing the
Table of Contents to locate an area of particular interest – a question
concerning reincarnation, prayer, the premature death of children, life
after death, etc. – and see how various high order Spirits (“the Spirits”)
address the issue. This will lead to further interest, at which time the
reader should begin with Kardec’s Introduction – essential for setting
the whole body of knowledge as revealed by the Spirits within the
proper context – and from there work through the entire book.

        ANNA BLACKWELL’S PREFACE
            TO HER VERSION

      Updated into Modern English
      by the Translators

       Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail, better known by his pen
name, ALLAN KARDEC, was born in Lyons on October 4, 1804
into an old family of Bourg-en-Bresse, which for many generations
had been honorably distinguished in the magistracy and at the bar.
His father, like his grandfather, was an attorney of good standing
and high character; his mother, who was remarkably beautiful,
accomplished, elegant and amiable, was the object, on his part, of
a profound and worshipping affection that remained unchanged
throughout his entire life.
       Educated at the Institution of Pestalozzi in Yverdun (Canton
de Vaud), he acquired at an early age the habit of investigation
and the freedom of thought of which his later life was destined to
furnish so striking an example. Endowed by nature with a passion
for teaching, he devoted himself from the age of fourteen to aiding
the studies of those of his schoolfellows who were less advanced
than himself. He was so fond of botany that he would often spend
an entire day in the mountains, walking twenty or thirty miles
with a backpack in search of specimens for his herbarium. Born

                                15

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


in a Catholic country but educated in a Protestant one, as a mere
boy he began to meditate on the means of bringing about a unity
of belief among the various Christian sects – a project of religious
reform at which he labored in silence for many years but necessarily
without success, since the elements of the desired solution were
not in his possession at the time.
       Having finished his studies at Yverdun, he returned to Lyons
at age 24 with the intention of devoting himself to law; however,
various acts of religious intolerance, to which he unexpectedly
found himself subjected, led him to renounce the idea of preparing
for the bar, and to take up residence in Paris, where he occupied
himself for some time in translating Telemachus and other standard
French books for youth into German. Having finally determined
what his career would be, in 1828 he purchased a large and
flourishing educational establishment for boys and devoted himself
to the work of teaching, for which, by his tastes and acquirements,
he was peculiarly suited. In 1830 and at his own expense he rented
a large hall on Rue de Sèvres, where he offered courses consisting
of free lectures on chemistry, physics, comparative anatomy, and
astronomy. He continued these lectures over a period of ten years.
They were highly successful and were attended by an audience
of over five hundred persons of every social class, many of whom
have since attained eminence in the scientific world.
       Always desirous to make education attractive as well as
profitable, he invented an ingenious method of computation, and
constructed a mnemotechnic table of French history for enabling
students to remember the remarkable events and discoveries of
each reign.
       Some of the numerous educational works he published
were: A Plan for the Improvement of Public Instruction, which he
submitted in 1828 to the French Legislative Chamber, which
praised it highly but took no action with regards to it; A Course


                                  16

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


of Practical and Theoretic Arithmetic, on the Pestalozzian System,
for the use of Teachers and Mothers (1829); A Classical Grammar
of the French Tongue (1831); A Manual for the use of Candidates
for Examination in the Public Schools with Explanatory Solutions
of various Problems of Arithmetic and Geometry (1848); Normal
Dictations for the Examinations of the Hotel de Ville and the Sorbonne
with Special Dictations on Orthographic Difficulties (1849). These
works were highly regarded at the time of their publication and
are still in use in many French schools. Their author continued
to produce new editions of some of them at the time of his death.
       He was a member of several scholarly societies such as:
The Royal Society of Arras, which awarded him with the Prize
of Honor in 1831 for a remarkable essay on the question, “What
is the System of Study most in Harmony with the Needs of the
Epoch?” For several years, he was Secretary to the Phrenological
Society of Paris, and took an active part in the labors of the Society
of Magnetism, giving much time to the practical investigation
of somnambulism, trance, clairvoyance, and the various other
phenomena connected with mesmerism. The following brief
outline of his labors will suffice to show his mental activity, the
variety of his knowledge, the eminently practical turn of his mind,
and his constant endeavor to be useful to his fellow humans.
       Around 1850, when the phenomenon of “table-turning”
was grabbing the attention of Europe and ushering in the other
phenomena since known as “Spiritist”, he quickly divined the real
nature of those phenomena as being evidence for the existence of
an order of relationships that had until then been suspected rather
than known; i.e., those that unite the visible and invisible worlds.
Foreseeing the vast importance to both science and religion of such
an extension of the field of human observation, he immediately
began a careful investigation of the new phenomena. A friend
of his had two daughters, who had become what are now called


                                  17

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


“mediums”. They were carefree, lively, amiable girls, who were
fond of socializing, dancing, and amusement. When “sitting” by
themselves or with their young companions, they habitually received
“communications” in harmony with their worldly and somewhat
frivolous dispositions. However, to the surprise of all concerned
it was discovered that whenever Kardec was present, the messages
transmitted through these young ladies acquired a very grave and
serious character. When he asked the invisible intelligences what
caused this change, he was told that, “spirits of a much higher order
than those who habitually communicate through the two young
mediums have come expressly for you and will continue to do so in
order to enable you to fulfill an important religious mission.”
        Much astonished at such an unexpected announcement, he
immediately proceeded to test its truthfulness by drawing up a
series of progressive questions in relation to the various problems
of human life and the universe in which we find ourselves, and
submitted them to his unseen interlocutors. He received their
answers to these questions through the instrumentality of the
two young mediums, who willingly consented to devote a couple
of evenings every week to this purpose, and who thus obtained,
through table-­  rapping and planchette-writing, the replies that
have become the basis of the Spiritist theory, and which they were
as little capable of appreciating as of inventing.
        When these conversations had been going on for nearly
two years, he remarked to his wife one day, in reference to the
unfolding of these views, which she had followed with intelligent
sympathy: “It is a most curious thing! My conversations with the
invisible intelligences have completely revolutionized my ideas
and convictions. The instructions thus transmitted constitute
an entirely new theory of human life, duty, and destiny, which
appears to me to be perfectly rational and coherent, admirably
lucid and consoling, and intensely interesting. I have a great mind


                                  18

                      Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


to publish these conversations in a book, for it seems to me that
what interests me so deeply might very likely prove interesting
to others as well.” His wife warmly approved of the idea, and so
he then submitted it to his unseen interlocutors, who replied in
the usual way that it was they who had suggested it to his mind;
that their communications had been made to him, not for himself
alone, but for the express purpose of being given to the world as
he proposed to do; and that the time had now come for putting
this plan into action. “To the book in which you will embody our
instructions”, continued the communicating intelligences, “you
will give, as being our work rather than yours, the title Le Livre des
Esprits (THE SPIRITS’ BOOK). You shall not publish it under
your own name, but under the pseudonym ALLAN KARDEC.1
Keep your own name Rivail for your own books already published,
but take and keep the name we have now given you for the book
you are about to publish under our orders, and, in general, for all
the work that you will have to do to fulfill the mission, which as
we have already told you, has been confided to you by Providence,
and which will gradually open before you as you proceed in it
under our guidance.”
       The book thus produced and published sold very quickly,
winning converts not only in France, but all over the Continent,
and making the name of ALLAN KARDEC “a household word”
to the readers who knew him only in connection with it. From
that time onwards, he was called only by that name, except by
his old personal friends, with whom both he and his wife always
retained their family name. Soon after its publication, he founded
The Parisian Society of Psychological Studies, of which he was
President until his death, and which met every Friday evening
at his house for the purpose of obtaining from spirits, through
writing mediums, instructions in the elucidation of truth and duty.

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


Until his death, he also founded and edited a monthly magazine,
entitled La Revue Spirite, which was devoted to advocating the
views set forth in The Spirits’ Book.
       Similar associations were quickly formed all over the world.
Many published periodicals of varying degrees of importance in
support of the new doctrine, and all of them transmitted to the
Parisian Society the most remarkable of the spirit-communications
they received. An enormous mass of spirit-teaching, unique both
in quantity and in the variety of the sources from which it was
obtained, thus found its way into the hands of Kardec, who
studied, collated and coordinated it with unwearied zeal and
devotion over a period of fifteen years. From the materials thus
furnished to him from every quarter of the globe he enlarged and
completed The Spirits’ Book under the direction of the Spirits, by
whom it was originally dictated. The “Revised Edition” of the
book, which he published in 1857 (see “Preface to the Revised
Edition”) has become the recognized textbook of the school of
Spiritualist Philosophy so intimately associated with his name.
From the same materials he subsequently compiled four other
works: The Mediums’ Book (a practical treatise on Mediumship and
Evocations), 1861; The Gospel according to Spiritism (an exposition
of morality from the Spiritist point of view), 1864; Heaven and
Hell (a vindication of the justice of the divine government of the
human race), 1865; and Genesis (showing the concordance of
the Spiritist theory with the discoveries of modern science and
with the general te­nor of the Mosaic record as explained by the
Spirits), 1868. He also published two short treatises, entitled What
is Spiritism? and Spiritism Reduced to its Simplest Expression.
       It is to be remarked, in connection with the works just
mentioned, that Kardec was not himself a “medium”, and was
therefore obliged to avail himself of the mediumship of others
in obtaining the spirit-communications from which they were


                                  20

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


evolved. The theory of life and duty, so immediately connected with
his name and labors that it is often erroneously supposed to have
been the product of his single mind or of the spirits in immediate
connection with him, is therefore far less the expression of a personal
or individual opinion than are any of the other spiritualistic theories
propounded thus far. This is because the basis of the religious
philosophy laid down in his works was not in any way the product of
his own intelligence, but was as new to him as to any of his readers.
It was progressively educed by him from the concurrent statements
of a legion of spirits through many thousands of mediums, who
were unknown to each other and belonged to different countries
and to every variety of social position.
       In person, Kardec was somewhat under middle height
and strongly built, with a large, round, massive head, well­-
marked features, and clear grey eyes; he looked more German
than French. Energetic and persevering, but of a temperament
that was calm, cautious, and unimaginative almost to coldness,
incredulous by nature and by education, a close, logical reasoner
and eminently practical in thought and deed, he was equally free
from mysticism and enthusiasm. Devoid of ambition, indifferent
to luxury and display, the modest income he had acquired from
teaching and from the sale of his educational works sufficed for
the simple style of living he had adopted, and allowed him to
devote all the profits arising from the sale of his Spiritist books
and from the Revue Spirite to propagating the movement he
initiated. His excellent wife relieved him of all domestic and
worldly cares, and thus enabled him to consecrate himself entirely
to the work to which he believed himself to have been called, and
which he pursued with unswerving devotion to the exclusion
of all extraneous occupations, interests, and companionships
from the time he first began it until he died. He made no visits
beyond a small circle of intimate friends and very rarely left Paris,


                                  21

                 Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


spending his winters in the heart of the town in the rooms where
be published his Revue, and his summers at the Villa Ségur, a
little semi-rural retreat which he had built and planted to be his
home in his and his wife’s old age, and which was located in the
suburban region behind the Champ de Mars. The area is now
crossed in every direction by broad avenues and is quickly being
built over, but at that time it was a sort of waste land that might
still pass for “the country”.
        Grave, slow of speech, unassuming in manner, yet not without
a certain quiet dignity resulting from the earnestness and single-
mindedness which were the distinguishing traits of his character,
neither courting nor avoiding discussion, but never volunteering
any remark upon the subject to which he had devoted his life, he
gracefully received the innumerable visitors from every part of the
world who came to converse with him in regard to the views of
which he was the recognized exponent. He answered questions
and objections, explained difficulties and provided information
to all serious inquirers, with whom he talked with freedom and
animation, his face occasionally lighting up with a genial and
pleasant smile, though his habitual sobriety of demeanor was such
that he was never known to laugh.
        Among the thousands by whom he was thus visited were
many of high rank in the social, literary, artistic, and scientific
worlds. The Emperor Napoleon III, whose interest in Spirit
phenomena was no mystery, sent for him several times and held
long conversations with him at the Tuileries concerning the
doctrines of The Spirits’ Book.
        Having suffered for many years from heart disease, Kardec
drew up the plans in 1869 for a new Spiritist organization
that would carry on the work of spreading the Doctrine after
his death. In order to assure its existence he gave it a legal and
commercial status and was determined to make it a regularly


                                  22

                Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


comprised joint­stock limited liability publishing and bookselling
company to be constituted for a period of ninety-nine years with
power to buy and sell, to issue stock, to receive donations and
bequests, etc. To this society, which was to be called “The Joint
Stock Company for the Continuation of the Works of Allan Kardec”,
he intended to transfer the copyright of his Spiritist writings and
of the Revue Spirite.
       Allan Kardec, however, was not destined to witness the
realization of the project in which he took so deep an interest,
and which has since been carried out with entire exactitude by
his widow.
       On March 31, 1869, having just finished drawing up the
constitution and rules of the society from which he foresaw that
he would soon be removed, he was seated in his usual chair at
his desk in his rooms on Rue Sainte Anne, and was tying up a
bundle of papers when his busy life was suddenly brought to an
end by the rupture of an aneurysm from which he had so long
suffered. His passage from the earth to the spirit world, with
which he had so closely identified himself, was instantaneous,
painless and without a sigh or a tremor; a most peaceful falling
asleep and reawakening – a fit ending for such a life. His remains
were interred in the cemetery of Montmartre in presence of a
great concourse of friends, many hundreds of whom assemble
there every year on the anniversary of his decease, during which
a few commemorative words are spoken and fresh flowers and
wreaths, as is usual in Continental graveyards, are laid upon his
tomb. It is impossible to precisely ascertain the number of those
who have adopted the views set forth by Allan Kardec. They are
estimated by themselves to be many millions, but they are at the
least incontestably very numerous. The periodicals devoted to
the advocacy of these views in various countries already number
over forty, and new ones are constantly appearing. Kardec’s death


                                 23

                Anna Blackwell’s Preface to Her Version


has not slackened the acceptance of the views set forth by him,
and which are believed by those who hold them to be the basis,
but the basis only, of the new development of religious truth
predicted by Christ; the beginning of the promised revelation of
“many things” that have been “kept hidden since the foundation
of the world”, and for the knowledge of which the human race
was “not ready” at the time of that prediction.

   PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION

       In the first edition of this work, we announced that there
would be a supplementary part comprised of all the issues which
could not be fitted into that edition, or which later circumstances
and investigation subsequently might bring to light. However,
since those issues pertained to materials that had already been
discussed and from which they had developed, to publish them in
a separate volume would not actually represent a sequel. Therefore,
we preferred to wait for the reprinting of the original in order to
assemble all the parts together, and we also took advantage of the
opportunity to arrange the book’s contents more methodically,
while at the same time eliminating duplications. As a result,
this reprinting may be considered as a new work, although the
principles of the first edition have undergone no change, except for
a few instances that comprise complements and explanations rather
than true modifications. In spite of the diversity of the sources
from which they have emanated, such conformity to the received
teachings is an important fact for establishing the Spiritist Science.
Moreover, our correspondence has shown us that communications
that are identical (if not in form, at least in substance) were obtained
in different places, and occurred even before the publication of our
book, a fact that has come to confirm and systematize them. History,
in turn, shows that most of its principles have been professed by the


                                  25

                     Preface to the Revised Edition


most distinguished thinkers of ancient and modern times; this fact
lends them additional sanction.
      The teachings regarding mediums and spirit manifestations
make up an aspect of Spiritism that is somewhat different from
the philosophy per se and can be the object of special study. Since
that aspect has received considerable improvement after more
experience has been acquired, we have decided to make a separate
volume of it, containing the responses to all the questions related to
manifestations and mediums, as well as to make several observations
on practical Spiritism. This work will be a continuation of or
supplement to The Spirits’ Book.

                    INTRODUCTION

                                  I

       When new matters arise, new words are needed for the sake
of clarity of language in order to avoid the confusion inherent in
multiple meanings for the same terms. For example, the words
spiritual, spiritualist and spiritualism each have a well-defined
meaning. To give each of them a new meaning in order to apply it
to the Spirits’ Doctrine would be to multiply the already ­numerous
causes of ambiguity. Strictly speaking, spiritualism is the opposite of
materialism and everyone who believes there is something within
them that is more than matter are spiritualists; however, it does not
necessarily follow that they must therefore believe in the existence
of spirits or in communications with the invisible world. Therefore,
instead of the words spiritual and spiritualism for designating this
latter belief, we have coined and employed the words Spiritist and
Spiritism. These two terms reflect their origin and their fundamental
meaning, and they thus have the advantage of being perfectly
understandable. We will leave spiritualism to its own meaning.
Hence, we will say that the principle of the Spiritist Doctrine or
Spiritism is based on the relationship between the material world
and the invisible world, the latter being inhabited by beings known
as spirits. The adherents of Spiritism will be called Spiritists.

                                  27

                               Introduction


      In a specialized sense, The Spirits’ Book contains the Spiritist
Doctrine; in a generalized sense, it is linked to spiritualism and
represents one aspect of it. That is why we have inscribed the
words on the title-page: Spiritualist Philosophy.

                                    II

         There is another word that we must also agree on since it
is one of the keys to every moral doctrine, and to that end it has
provoked innumerable controversies due to the lack of a generally
accepted meaning: it is the word soul. The differences of viewpoints
regarding the nature of the soul come from the individual definition
that each person attaches to this word. A perfect language, in which
each idea would be represented by its own specialized term, would
avoid many arguments; with a single word for each thing, everything
would be understood.
         According to some, the soul is the principle of material organic
life; it has no existence of its own and at death it ceases to exist. This
view is purely materialistic. In this sense and by comparison, those
who have adopted this view speak of the body at death as though it
were a broken instrument that no longer produces any sound; i.e.,
that it no longer has a soul. According to this viewpoint, the soul
would be an effect rather than a cause.
         Others believe that the soul is the principle of intelligence, the
universal agent of which each being absorbs a portion. According
to this group, there is only one soul in the entire universe. This
soul distributes a spark of itself to the various intelligent beings
throughout their lives. At death, each spark returns to the common
source, where it merges once again into the whole, just as streams
and rivers return to the ocean that gave them origin. This viewpoint
differs from the preceding one in that, according to this theory,
there is something more than matter within us – something that


                                    28

                              Introduction


remains after death. On the other hand, it is almost as if nothing
actually remained; since our individual personality no longer
survives, we are no longer conscious of ourselves. According to
this viewpoint, the universal soul would be God, and each being
would be a portion of God. It is a type of pantheism.
       Finally, according to others the soul is a moral being distinct
from and independent of matter, and it preserves its individuality
after death. This conception is incontestably the most common
because, under one name or another, the idea of this being that
survives the body is an instinctive belief that is independent of
any particular teaching and can be found among all cultures to
whatever degree they may have become civilized. This doctrine,
in which the soul is a cause and not an effect, is that of spiritualists.
       Without discussing the merit of each of these viewpoints,
and considering only the linguistic side of the issue, we will state
that these three applications of the word soul comprise three distinct
ideas, each one requiring a different term. Thus, the word soul can
have one of three meanings and each is correct from its own point
of view according to its own particular definition. Language itself
is to blame for having only one word available for three different
ideas. In order to avoid confusion, it would be necessary to limit
the meaning of the word soul to only one of those three ideas.
Choosing this or that definition would not matter, since it is
simply a matter of convention; the important thing is clarity. We
think that is most logical to take it in its commonest meaning, and
we thus use soul to indicate the immaterial and individual being
that dwells within and survives the body. Even if this being did not
really exist and was no more than a product of the imagination, a
term would be needed to designate it nonetheless.
       Lacking such a specific term for each of the other two
ideas, we will apply the label vital principle to define the material
and organic life principle – whatever its source may be – which


                                   29

                                      Introduction


is common to all living creatures, from plants to humans. Since
life can exist without the faculty of thought, the vital principle is
something distinct and independent of it. The word vitality would
not express the same idea, however. For some, the vital principle
is a property of matter, an effect produced wherever matter is
found under given conditions. According to others – and this idea
is the commonest – it is found in a special, universally diffused
fluid.2 Each being absorbs and assimilates a portion of this fluid
throughout its life much as inert bodies absorb light. This substance
is the vital fluid, which, according to certain opinions, would be
the same thing as the animalized electric energy, also designated as
magnetic fluid, neural fluid, etc.
        Whatever the case may be, there is one incontestable fact – for
it results from observation – and that is that organic beings possess
an inner force that produces the phenomenon of life as long as
this force exists; that physical life is common to all organic beings
and is independent of intelligence and thought; that intelligence
and thought are faculties peculiar to certain organic species; and
lastly, that among the organic species endowed with intelligence
and thought, there is one that is endowed with a special moral
sense that gives it incontestable ascendancy over the others: the
human species.
        It should be understood that in its multiple meanings
the term soul does not exclude either materialism or pantheism.
Spiritualists themselves can very well understand soul according to
one or the other of the first two definitions, without denying the
distinct immaterial being; they would give some other name to it.
Thus, the word soul does not represent a personal opinion; it is a
Proteus3 that everyone may adapt in their own way, a fact that has
led to endless argument.

                              Introduction


       Even if we were to use the word soul in all three of its meanings,
we might avoid confusion if we added a qualification to it in order
to specify the way in which we envisage it or the application we are
giving it at the time. Hence, it would be a generic term, representing
simultaneously the principles of material life, intelligence and moral
sense. Each of these would be distinguished by a particular attribute,
like gas, for example, which may be differentiated by using the words
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Perhaps we could most correctly use
the term vital soul for the principle of material life, intellectual soul
for the principle of intelligence, and spiritual soul for the principle
of our individuality after death. As one can plainly see, it is all a
matter of words, but a very important matter for us to understand
nevertheless. Thus, the vital soul would be common to all organic
beings: plants, animals and humans; the intellectual soul would be
the distinctive property of animals and humans, and the spiritual
soul would apply only to humans.
       We believe it is necessary to insist on such explanations since
the Spiritist Doctrine naturally rests on the existence within us of
a being independent of matter. This being survives the body at
death. Since the word soul is repeated frequently throughout this
work, we have thus had to set the meaning we attach to it in order
to avoid any misunderstanding.
       We now come to the principal objective of this preliminary
instruction.

                                  III

       Like every new theory, the Spiritist Doctrine has its followers
and its detractors. We will endeavor to respond to some of the
latters’ objections by examining the validity of the reasons upon
which such objections are based, without, however, intending to
convince everybody – there are those who believe that the light


                                   31

                                    Introduction


was made solely for them. We will turn our attention to those
of good faith, who are without preconceptions or set minds, but
who sincerely desire to learn. We will prove to them that most of
their objections to the Doctrine are the result of an incomplete
observation of the factual events and a judgment formed too
quickly and too rashly.
       To start with, we will briefly recall the progressive series of
phenomena that originated the Doctrine.
       The first event to be observed was the movement of various
objects, popularly called table-turning4 or the dance of the tables.
This phenomenon appears to have been first observed in America
(or rather, it recurred in that country, since history shows that it
actually dates back to remote antiquity) and was produced and
accompanied by other strange occurrences such as unusual noises
and raps emitted without any obvious or known cause. From
America, it rapidly spread throughout Europe and other parts
of the world. It was met with much disbelief at first, but the
multiplicity of the experiences soon left no doubt as to its reality.
       If the phenomenon had been limited to the movement of
physical objects, it might have been explained by some purely
physical cause. After all, we are far from knowing about all the
secret agents of nature, or even all the properties of those we
do know about. Electricity, for example, offers to humankind
resources that multiply daily, and it appears ready to illuminate
science with a new light. Therefore, if electricity were modified
by certain circumstances or some unknown agent, it is quite
possible that it could have been the cause behind the movement.
The gathering of several persons in a group increased the strength
of the action, which appeared to support this theory since such
a group could be regarded as a kind of multi-cell battery whose
power corresponded to the number of participants.

                                     Introduction


        The circular movement of the objects was nothing
extraordinary – it belongs to nature itself. All the heavenly bodies
move in circles. Thus, we could have had before us nothing more
than a small reflection of the general movement of the universe,
or rather, under certain circumstances, an as-yet unknown cause
fortuitously producing in small objects a current analogous to that
which impels the worlds through space.
        The movement, however, was not always circular. It was
frequently brusque and disorderly. The object would be violently
shaken, overturned, carried about in every direction, and contrary
to all the laws of statics5, suspended and held in the air. Nevertheless,
there was nothing in these events that might not be explainable by
the force of some invisible physical agent. After all, do we not see
electricity knock down buildings, uproot trees, attract or repel the
heaviest bodies or hurl them to considerable distances?
        Assuming that the unusual noises and raps were not the
common effects of the wood expanding or some other fortuitous
cause, then they might very well have been produced by an
accumulation of some kind of concealed fluid. After all, does not
electricity produce the most violent noises?
        Up to this point, everything might have been considered as
belonging to the domain of the purely physical and physiological.
Even within this narrow scope, however, one would think that
the material at hand would surely be worthy of serious study and
the attention of scholars. Why was that not the case? As hard
as it is to admit, it is connected to reasons that prove, among a
thousand other similar ones, the shallowness of the human mind.
First, the commonness of the main object that served as the basis
for the earliest experiments – a plain table – was nothing out of
the ordinary. How interesting is the influence of a simple word in

the most serious matters! Without ever considering the fact that
the movement could involve any object whatsoever, the focus on
tables undoubtedly prevailed as the most convenient because they
could accommodate more individuals around them than any other
piece of furniture. However, “superior” minds were sometimes too
narrow-minded and felt it too belittling to concern themselves
with what was commonly called the dance of the tables. If the
phenomenon observed by Galvani6 had likewise been observed
by ordinary persons instead and given some burlesque nickname,
it would probably have also been regarded as having the same
credibility as a magic wand. What scholars would not have deemed
it beneath them to concern themselves with the dance of the frogs?
       A few individuals, however, were modest enough to admit
that nature might not have given them its final word, and they
wanted to observe the matter for themselves in order to set their
minds at ease. But it just so happened that the phenomenon did
not always correspond to their expectations, and since it was not
produced consistently either according to their wishes or their
method of experimentation, they came to a negative conclusion.
However, despite their verdict, the tables continued to turn, and we
may state with Galileo, “Nevertheless, they move!” Furthermore, we
can state that the occurrences have multiplied in such a way that
nowadays7 they have earned the right of citizenship, and that we
only need to find a rational explanation for them. Can anything be
inferred against the reality of the phenomenon by the fact that it is
not always produced in exactly the same way and according to the
will and requirements of the observer? The phenomena of electricity
and chemistry depend on certain conditions, but could we deny

their existence because they cannot be produced apart from such
conditions? Should we find it surprising that the phenomenon of the
movement of objects by the human fluid also requires its own special
conditions, and that it ceases when the observers – set in their point
of view – try to produce it at their own whim or subject it to the law
of ordinary phenomena, without considering the fact that for a new
order of events there must also be new laws? In order to understand
such laws, it is necessary to study the circumstances under which the
phenomena are produced, and such a study cannot be but the result
of persevering, careful and sometimes very prolonged observation.
        People often object that there is frequently obvious fraud
involved. We in turn would like to ask if they are quite sure that
it is fraud, or instead, if it might be that they have attached the
fraud label to things they were unable to understand, the same way
uneducated persons might see in a physicist’s experiments only
the tricks of a deft magician. And even assuming that fraud does
sometimes occur, would that be a reason to deny the phenomenon
itself? Must we deny physics simply because there are magicians
who call themselves physicists? Moreover, it is necessary to consider
the character of supposedly fraudulent persons and what interest
they might have in deceiving us. Could it all be just a prank? A
prank can hold our attention for a little while, but if it goes on
too long it becomes as wearisome for the prankster as it is for
the object of the prank. Furthermore, a prank perpetrated from
one end of the world to the other and among the most serious,
venerable and enlightened individuals would be something at least
as extraordinary as the phenomenon itself.

                                 IV

       If the phenomena we are considering had been limited only
to the movement of objects, they would have remained within the

                            Introduction


domain of the physical sciences – as we have stated – but that is
not what happened. They were destined to place us on the trail
of events of a strange order. It was soon discovered (we do not
know at whose initiative) that the impulse given to the objects was
not simply the product of some blind mechanical force; rather,
an intelligent cause was behind in the movement. This opened
the way to an entirely new field of observation – the veil could be
lifted on many mysteries. Was there actually an intelligent power
involved, however? If so, what was it? What was its nature? What
was its origin? Was it superior to humankind? Such were the other
questions that derived from the first.
       The first intelligent manifestations occurred by means
of tables that moved and struck the floor with one leg a certain
number of times, thereby responding to the question asked,
according to what had been agreed on as to the number that
would indicate either “yes” or “no”. Even here there was nothing
very convincing for the skeptics, since it could have been seen as
a chance effect. Later, however, more highly developed responses
were received using the letters of the alphabet. By striking the
floor a certain number of times for each letter, the table formed
words and sentences in response to the questions. The correctness
of the responses and their congruency with the question caused
astonishment. When asked about its nature, the mysterious being
who gave the responses declared that it was a spirit; it stated its
name and furnished other sorts of information. This should be
seen as a highly important occurrence. No one individual in
particular had ever even thought of spirits as a way to explain the
phenomenon; instead, it was the phenomenon itself that revealed the
term. Hypotheses are frequently formed in the physical sciences to
serve as a basis for reasoning, but that did not happen in this case.
       Communicating in this manner, however, was wearisome
and inconvenient. One of these invisible beings – and this is also


                                 36

                                     Introduction


a noteworthy occurrence – suggested another. This particular
spirit advised fitting a pencil to a small basket or other object.
When placed on a sheet of paper, the basket was moved by the
same hidden power that had turned the tables. However, instead
of a simple regular movement, the pencil wrote by itself, forming
words, sentences and entire discourses of many pages dealing
with the deepest questions of philosophy, morality, metaphysics,
psychology, etc., and as quickly as though written by hand.
       This suggestion was given in America, France and several
other countries simultaneously. Here are the terms in which it was
given in Paris on June 10, 1853 to one of the most fervent disciples
of the Doctrine, who, for many years – since 1849 – had been
occupied with the evocation of spirits: “Go into the next room
and get that little basket; attach a pencil to it and then place it
on a sheet of paper with your fingers on the rim.” This was done
and after a few moments the basket began to move and the pencil
legibly wrote this sentence: “I expressly forbid you to tell anyone
what I have just told you; the next time I write, I will write better.”
       Since the object to which the pencil is fitted is merely an
instrument, its nature and form do not matter; the most convenient
means was sought for, and it was thus that many individuals began
to use a planchette.8
       The basket or planchette will not move, however, except
under the influence of certain persons gifted with a special
ability. These are called mediums, that is, intermediaries between
spirits and humans. The conditions that produce this ability are
linked both to physical and moral causes that are still imperfectly
understood. Mediums are of all ages, of both sexes and of all
degrees of intellectual development. Moreover, the faculty can be
developed further by exercising it.
		“A small triangular or heart-shaped board supported by two casters and a pencil or
8

  stylus that, when moved by the fingertips across a surface, supposedly writes clairvoyant
  messages or subconscious thoughts. (Webster’s, op. cit.) – Tr.



                                           37

                              Introduction


                                  V

       It was then realized that the basket and the planchette were
only extensions of the hand, and that when mediums held the
pencil directly, their hand was made to write by an involuntary,
almost feverish impulse. In this way, the communications became
faster, easier and complete. Nowadays, this is the most common
method, and the number of persons endowed with this ability is
quite considerable and increases daily. Finally, experience revealed
many other varieties of mediumship, and it was discovered that
communications could also occur through speech, hearing, sight,
touch, etc., and even through spirits writing directly, that is,
without using the medium’s hand or the pencil.
       This fact having been established, there was still one more
essential point to consider: the role of the medium in the responses and
the part he or she might play both mechanically and mentally. Two
crucial circumstances (which would not escape the attentive observer)
make it possible to settle the issue. The first is the way by which the
basket moves under the medium’s influence by simply placing the
fingers on its rim; an examination will show the impossibility of the
medium guiding the basket in any way. This impossibility becomes
especially obvious when two or three persons are touching the basket
at the same time. It would require a truly phenomenal coordination
of movement between them in addition to an extraordinary similarity
of thought that would enable them to understand each other and
give answers to the questions. Another no less original fact adds to
the problem, that being the radical change in the writing according
to the individual spirit who communicates; the same writing recurs
whenever the same spirit returns. For this to happen, it would be
necessary for the medium to have trained him or herself to change
writing styles twenty different ways, and furthermore, he or she would
have to remember the style of this or that spirit every time.


                                  38

                                        Introduction


       The second circumstance results from the nature of the
responses themselves, which, in most cases – especially when
dealing with abstract or scientific questions – are obviously
outside the knowledge, and sometimes the intellectual reach, of
the medium. Moreover, the medium is usually unaware of what
is being written or may not even understand the question, which
may be asked mentally or even in a foreign language, with the
answer given in the same language. Furthermore, the basket may
write spontaneously about some completely unexpected subject,
without any question having been asked regarding it.
       In some cases, the responses reveal a level of wisdom, depth
and timeliness, and the thoughts are so elevated and sublime that
they could only have come from a higher intelligence imbued
with the purest morality. At other times, they are so flippant, so
frivolous and so banal that reason refuses to accept the possibility
that they could have come from the same source. Such diversity of
language can only be explained by the diversity of the intelligences
who manifest themselves. Are these intelligences human or not?
That is the point to clarify, and for which a complete explanation,
as conveyed by the Spirits9 themselves, will be found in this book.
       Here we are facing obvious effects that are produced outside
the circle of our habitual observations. These effects do not occur
mysteriously, but in the full light of day; anyone can see and
observe them because they are not the privilege of one individual
in particular, but are repeated every day by thousands of persons
at will. These effects necessarily have a cause, and since they reveal
the action of an intelligence and a will, they are outside the purely
physical realm.
       Many theories have been formulated regarding the matter.
We will examine them briefly and will see if they can render

comprehensible all the facts that have surfaced. In the meantime,
however, let us accept the existence of beings distinct from
humankind – since that is the explanation given by the intelligences
themselves – and let us see what they might have to tell us.

                                  VI

       As we stated previously, the beings who communicate have
identified themselves as spirits, and at least some of them say that they
have lived before as human beings on the earth. They comprise the spirit
world, as during our life on earth we comprise the corporeal world.
       We will now briefly sum up the main points of the Doctrine
that they have transmitted to us so that we may more easily reply
to certain objections:
       “God is eternal, immutable, immaterial, one, all­powerful,
and supremely just and good.
       “God created the universe, which includes all animate and
inanimate, material and immaterial beings.
       “The material beings comprise the visible or corporeal
world, whereas the immaterial beings comprise the invisible or
spirit world, i.e. the world of spirits.
       “The spirit world is the normal, primitive, eternal, preexistent
and all-surviving world.
       “The corporeal world is secondary; it could cease to exist –
or it might never have existed in the first place – without changing
the essence of the spirit world.
       “Spirits temporarily take on a perishable material envelope
and its destruction by death returns them to freedom.
       “From among all the different species of corporeal beings,
God chose the human species for the incarnation of spirits who
have reached a certain degree of development. This endows them
with a moral and intellectual ascension over the others.

                                        Introduction


       “The soul is an incarnate spirit; the body is only its envelope.
       “Human beings are composed of three things: first, the body
or material being, similar to that of the animals and animated by the
same vital principle; second, the soul or immaterial being, the spirit
incarnated in the body; and third, the link that unites the soul to the
body, an intermediary principle between the body and spirit.
       “Human beings thus have two natures: by means of their body
they share in the nature of the animals and share the same instincts;
by means of their soul they share in the nature of the spirits.
       “The link or perispirit unites the body and the spirit. It is
a sort of semi-material envelope. Death destroys only the denser
envelope, i.e. the physical body. The spirit retains the perispirit,
which comprises its ethereal body. The perispirit is invisible to us
in its normal state, but the spirit can render it visible and even
tangible, as occurs during the phenomenon of apparitions.
       “Therefore, a spirit is not an abstract, indefinable being that
can only be conceived of by thought. It is a real, circumscribed
being that in certain cases may be perceived by our senses of sight,
hearing and touch.
       “Spirits belong to different orders and they are not all equal in
power, intelligence, knowledge or morality. Those of the first order
are the most highly evolved spirits. These spirits are distinguished
by their perfection, knowledge and closeness to God, in addition to
the purity of their sentiments and their love of the good10. They are
angels or pure spirits. The other orders are in various degrees more
distant from such perfection. The spirits of the lowest orders share
our base passions – hatred, envy, jealousy, pride, etc. – and actually
take pleasure in wrongdoing. Among these are spirits who are neither
very good nor very evil, and who are usually more troublesome and
scheming than downright wicked. Essentially mischievous and
inconsequential, they are the foolish and frivolous spirits.

        “Spirits do not belong to the same order forever. They all
improve themselves, passing through the different degrees of the spirit
hierarchy.11 This improvement occurs through incarnation, which is
imposed on some as an expiation, and on others as a mission. Earthly
life is a trial to which they submit themselves many times until they
reach perfection. It is a kind of sifter or purifier from which they
emerge at different degrees of refinement or improvement.
        “Upon leaving the body, the soul returns to the spirit world
from which it came. Following a longer or shorter stay in the spirit
world, it will once more start a new physical life.12
        “Since our spirit must pass through many incarnations, it
follows that we all have had many existences, and that we will have
still others along the course of the different stages of advancement.
This will occur either on the earth or on other worlds.
        “The incarnation of spirits always occurs in the human
species. It would be an error to believe that the soul or spirit could
incarnate in the body of an animal.
        “The many corporeal lives of a spirit are always progressive
and never regressive, but the speed of its progress depends on the
efforts that it makes to reach perfection.
        “The qualities of the soul are those of the incarnate spirit.
Thus, a moral person is the incarnation of a good spirit, while a
wicked person is that of a little-evolved spirit.
        “The soul has its own particular individuality before
incarnating, and it retains it after it separates from the body.
        “Upon its return to the spirit world, the soul reencounters
all those whom it had known while on earth, and all of its former
lives are delineated in its memory. It can thus recall all the good
and evil it had done.

       “The incarnate spirit is under the influence of matter.
Persons who overcome this influence by elevating and purifying
their soul grow closer to the good spirits, among whom they will
be counted someday. However, those who allow themselves to be
controlled by their evil passions, and who take full pleasure in
satisfying their crude appetites by yielding to their animal nature,
grow closer to the lower order spirits.
       “Incarnate spirits inhabit various globes throughout the
universe.
       “Discarnate or errant spirits do not occupy any fixed or
circumscribed region. They are everywhere, in space and beside us,
watching and intermingling with us all the time. They comprise
an invisible population that is always active around us.
       “Spirits constantly act upon the mental world and even
upon the physical world. They act upon matter and thought. They
comprise one of the powers of nature and are the actual cause
behind a multitude of phenomena that have been unexplainable
or poorly explained until now, and which have not found a rational
solution except in Spiritism.
       “Interaction between spirits and humans is constant. Good
spirits encourage us to follow the path of the good. They support
us in the trials of life and help us to bear them with courage and
resignation. Evil spirits, on the other hand, encourage us to take
the path of evil. It is a pleasure for them when they see us succumb
and fall to their level.
       “Spirit communications with humans are either concealed or
direct. Concealed communications – undetectable in a physical sense –
occur through the good or bad influence they exert on us without our
even suspecting it and it depends on our own judgment to distinguish
between their good and bad inspirations. Direct communications
occur through writing, speech or other physical means, usually by way
of mediums who serve as their instruments.

                                          Introduction


       “Spirits manifest either by appearing spontaneously or by
being evoked. We can evoke all spirits, whether they have animated
obscure individuals or the most illustrious personages, regardless
of when they lived. We can evoke our relatives, friends or enemies.
Through written or verbal communications we may obtain advice,
information about their current situation, their thoughts about
us – whatever revelations they are permitted to convey.
       “Spirits are attracted according to the affinity they have with
the moral nature of the persons who evoke them. High order spirits
enjoy serious meetings, where the love of the good and a sincere
desire to learn and grow predominate. Their presence repels low
order spirits. These find free access to and can influence frivolous
persons or those who are only guided by curiosity, or wherever
else evil instincts may be found. Rather than receiving any good
advice or useful information from these spirits, we should expect
nothing more from them than frivolities, lies, mischievous pranks
and deceitfulness. They frequently use venerable names in order to
better induce us to error.
       “Nevertheless, distinguishing between good and evil13
spirits is extremely easy. The language of high order spirits is always
dignified, noble, imbued with the highest morality and free from
every lower passion. Their counsels reveal the highest wisdom
and always address our progress and the good of humankind.
Low order and inconsequential spirits are almost always trite
and can even be crass. They might sometimes say things that are
good and true, but more often they make erroneous and absurd
statements either out of malice or ignorance. They laugh at
people’s gullibility and amuse themselves at the cost of those who
question them, flattering their vanity and cajoling their desires
with false hopes. In sum, serious communications, in the perfect

meaning of the term, only occur at serious centers14, where the
members are united by an intimate communion of thought
directed toward the good.
       “The morality of high order spirits may be summed up in
the Gospel maxim of Christ: ‘Do unto others as you would like
them to do unto you’; that is, practice the good and not evil. In
this principle, humankind finds the universal rule of conduct even
for the smallest actions.
       “They teach us that selfishness, pride and lust are passions
that drag us down to our animal nature, keeping us enslaved to
matter; that those on earth who free themselves of matter through
their disregard for worldly frivolities, and who cultivate love for
their neighbor, draw closer to their spiritual nature; that each
one of us should make ourselves useful according to the faculties
and means that God has placed in our hands to put us to the
test; that the strong and powerful should support and protect
the weak, for those who abuse their strength and power in order
to oppress others violate God’s law. Lastly, they teach us that
nothing can be hidden in the spirit world; that hypocrites will be
unmasked there and all their evil exposed; that the inevitable and
constant presence of those whom we have harmed is one of the
punishments awaiting us there; that the unevolved and evolved
states of spirits in that world correspond to sorrows and joys that
are unknown to us on earth.
       “However, they also teach us that there are no unforgivable
sins, none that cannot be erased by expiation.15 Depending on
our desire and effort, we find the necessary means to expiate them
in the many existences that enable us to advance on the path of
progress toward perfection, our final objective.”

  atone for; make amends or reparation for.” (ibid.) – Tr.

      This is the summary of the Spiritist Doctrine as it appears
in the teachings of the Spirits. Let us now look at the objections
made against it.

                                            VII

       For many people, opposition from the institutions of
higher learning represents, if not actual evidence, at least a strong
argument challenging the Doctrine. We are not among those
who would clamor against these scholars, lest we be regarded as
disrespectful of their erudition. On the contrary, we hold them in
great esteem and would be greatly honored to be numbered among
them.16 Their opinion, however, does not represent an irrefutable
judgment in every circumstance.
       When science goes beyond the material observation of
phenomena and attempts to appraise and explain them, the field
opens wide for scientists to make speculations. They build their
own little theories, hope to see them prevail and fiercely defend
their veracity. Don’t we see every day the most contradictory
opinions being proposed, rejected and repealed as absurd errors,
only to be proclaimed later as incontestable truths? The facts are
the sole criteria for judgment, the incontestable line of reasoning.
In the absence of facts, skepticism is the position taken by the wise.
       Scholars’ opinions on topics they have researched fully are
justifiably believable because their knowledge about them is broader
and better than that of common folk. However, when it comes
to new principles and unknown matters, their way of looking at
them is nothing more than hypothetical and they always observe
them in the light of their own prejudices. One could perhaps safely

  of several learned societies. Please refer to his bio in Anna Blackwell’s Preface to this book

state that scholars are possessed of even more prejudices than other
persons due to their natural propensity for subjecting everything
to the point of view of their own particular area of knowledge:
mathematicians accept no proof beyond algebraic formulas;
chemists relate everything to the interaction of the elements, and
so on. Those who dedicate themselves to a particular specialty try
to fit all their ideas into it. However, draw them away from their
area of expertise and they almost always talk nonsense because they
submit everything to their own point of view – a very common
human weakness. I will gladly and confidently consult a chemist
concerning a question of elemental analysis, a physicist concerning
the power of electricity and an engineer concerning motive power.
However, they must allow me – without affecting the esteem I
owe them for their particular expertise – not to take their negative
opinion about Spiritism into consideration any more than I would
take an architect’s judgment on a question about music.
       The physical sciences are based on the properties of matter,
which can be subjected to experimentation and manipulated at
will. Spirit phenomena, on the other hand, rest on the action of
intelligences who have wills of their own, and who show us at every
turn that they are not subject to our whims. Spirit manifestations
consequently cannot be dealt with in the same way as physical matter.
They require special conditions and a different approach, and trying
to subject them to ordinary investigative procedures would be trying
to establish analogies that do not exist. Science per se is incompetent
to make any declaration of its own on the issue of Spiritism. It is not
science’s place to concern itself with the subject, and its favorable or
unfavorable verdict regarding it carries no weight. Spiritism results
from a personal conviction that scholars may hold as individuals
regardless of their status as scholars. Submitting the issue to science
would be like handing the solution of the problem of the existence of
the soul to a group of physicists and astronomers. In fact, Spiritism


                                  47

                              Introduction


rests entirely on the existence of the soul and its state after death. It
would be highly illogical to think that a particular person must be a
great psychologist simply because he or she is a great mathematician
or anatomist. For example, an anatomist dissects a human body in
search of the soul but does not find it under his scalpel as he would
find a nerve, nor does he see it rise like a mist. Based exclusively on
the material examination of the issue, he thus concludes that the
soul does not exist. Does it follow then that he is correct although his
view is contrary to universal opinion regarding the immortality of
the soul? No. You can therefore see why Spiritism does not fall under
the jurisdiction of science. When Spiritist beliefs become known
and accepted by the masses – and judging by the speed at which
they are spreading, that time is not far off – the same thing will
happen regarding Spiritism as has happened regarding all other new
ideas that have encountered opposition: scholars will yield to the
evidence. One by one, they will accept Spiritist beliefs by necessity,
but until then it would be premature to distract them from their
specialized endeavors in order to compel them to occupy themselves
with a foreign matter that is neither within their prerogatives nor
contained in their theories. Meanwhile, those who take a negative
stance without a prior, in-depth study of the issue, and who ridicule
those who do not agree with their opinion, forget that the same
has happened regarding the majority of the great discoveries that
have honored humankind. They risk seeing their names added to
the list of illustrious deniers of new ideas and inscribed alongside the
names of the erudite assembly, which in 1752 laughed uproariously
at Franklin’s paper on lightning rods, considering it unworthy
of mention among the subjects to be discussed; or the names of
that other group that caused France to lose its advantage in steam
powered navigation by declaring Fulton’s theory an impracticable
dream. Nevertheless, both issues were within the scope of science.
If those assemblies, comprised of the greatest scholars in the world,


                                   48

                             Introduction


had only contempt and sarcasm for ideas which they did not yet
understand, but which would revolutionize science, customs and
industry a few years later, what hope is there that an issue completely
foreign to their endeavors might be received any better?
       The regrettable errors of a few scholars regarding Spiritism
should not lessen our respect for them regarding other subjects,
but is an official diploma necessary for common sense? Are there
only fools and simpletons outside academic halls? Let us take a
survey of the followers of the Spiritist Doctrine to determine if
among them there are only uneducated persons, and if the huge
number of individuals of merit who have embraced it would justify
relegating it to the realm of simple superstition. The character
and learning of such individuals authorizes us to state that if they
affirm it, there must at least be something to it.
       We repeat once more that if the phenomena with which
we are concerning ourselves had been restricted to the mechanical
movement of objects, research into their physical cause would
indeed be within the realm of science. However, since they involve
manifestations outside the sphere of human laws and cannot be
explained either by numbers or by mechanical forces, they are
therefore outside the competence of physical science. When a new
phenomenon arises that does not fit within the scope of any known
science, then in order to study it scholars must set their science
aside and say to themselves that they are dealing with a new area of
study that cannot be delved into according to preconceived ideas.
       Those who consider their reason to be infallible are very
close to error; even those whose ideas are highly erroneous are
supported by their reasoning, and that is why they reject everything
that appears impossible to them. Those who yesterday rejected
the admirable discoveries that humanity is proud of today also
followed their own judgment in doing so. What we call reason
is almost always masked pride, and those who believe they are


                                  49

                               Introduction


infallible place themselves on a par with God. Therefore, we will
focus on those who are reasonable enough to suspend judgment
regarding matters that they have not witnessed first hand, and
judging the future in the light of the past, do not believe that
humankind has yet reached its apogee or that nature has revealed
the last page of her book to them.

                                  VIII

       We would add that the study of a doctrine like Spiritism,
which suddenly unveils such new and grand revelations, can only
be profitably pursued by serious, persevering and open-minded
individuals animated by a firm and sincere desire to arrive at a result.
This qualification does not include those who lightly make a priori
judgments without having observed everything, and who neglect
pursuing their examination of the Doctrine with the necessary
continuity, regularity and concentration of thought; nor does it include
those who, in order not to diminish their reputation as individuals of
genius, endeavor to find something to ridicule in the most serious
matters that are studied by individuals whose knowledge, character
and convictions deserve the respect of all who pride themselves on
their social graces. Let those who do not deem the facts worthy of
their attention abstain. No one intends to violate their beliefs; for their
part, however, they should respect the beliefs of others.
       Continuity is what characterizes serious study. Thus, should
we wonder at not receiving proper responses to questions that are
serious in nature but asked at random and abruptly in the midst of
a bundle of other nonsensical ones? A complex question requires
preliminary and supplementary ones in order to be answered clearly.
Whoever wishes to acquire knowledge about a particular science
must study it methodically, starting at the very beginning and

who does not know the basics of a particular science pose questions
at random to a scholar and profit from it? Could a well-intentioned
scholar even give satisfactory responses to such a person? Such out-
of-context responses would necessarily be incomplete and might
therefore be nearly unintelligible, or they might even seem absurd
and contradictory. The same applies regarding our relationships
with spirits. If we desire to learn from them, we must take their
course of study; however, just as we do in our own schools, we must
choose our teachers and then work diligently.
        We have stated that high order spirits only take part in serious
meetings, especially those characterized by perfect communion of
thought and moral sentiment. Frivolousness and idle curiosity
repel them just as they would repel any reasonable individual.
These two traits open the field to the mass of deceitful and
frivolous spirits who are always eagerly watching for opportunities
to mock us and amuse themselves at our expense. What would
happen to any serious question posed in such a meeting? Who
is it that is actually providing the response – if one is received at
all? It would be like being in the company of boisterous revelers
and throwing out questions such as: What is the soul? What is
death? and others just as entertaining. If you want serious answers,
you yourself must be serious in every sense of the word and place
yourself within all the required conditions. Only then will you
obtain worthwhile responses. Be most diligent and persevering in
your studies; otherwise, the high order spirits will abandon you, as
a professor would abandon negligent students.

       The movement of inert objects is a proven fact. However,
it remains to be seen whether or not there are manifestations of
intelligence in such movement, and if so, what their source is.


                                  51

                               Introduction


        We are not referring to manifestations involving the intelligent
movement of certain objects, to manifestations involving verbal
communications, or to communications written directly by the
medium’s hand. These kinds of manifestations are quite obvious to
those who have deeply investigated the subject, but they may not
at first glance be sufficiently independent of the medium’s own will
to be convincing to a new observer. Thus, we will focus only on the
writings obtained with the help of a pencil attached to some object
such as a small basket, a planchette, etc. As we have stated, the way
in which the medium’s fingers are placed upon the object challenges
the notion that any sort of skillful interference is at work in the way
the words are formed. For the sake of discussion, however, let us
suppose that by some extraordinary ability the medium might be able
to deceive the most attentive observer. How could one explain the
nature of the responses themselves when they are beyond the scope
of the medium’s own ideas and knowledge? We are not referring
here to simple one-syllable replies, but to many pages written with
astonishing speed on a subject that may either be spontaneous or
specifically requested. From the hand of a medium completely
unversed in literature stream forth poems of such sublimity and
impeccable purity that they are worthy of the best human poets. In
addition, what is even more remarkable is the fact that these pages are
being produced everywhere and the number of mediums is rapidly
increasing. Are these occurrences real or not? To this question we
can only reply: watch and observe – the opportunities will not be
lacking. Above all, however, observe persistently over a long period
of time and under the appropriate conditions.
        How have our antagonists responded to the evidence? They say,
“You are victims of either charlatanism or illusion.” First, we will reply
that charlatanism is not likely where there is no profit to be made;
charlatans do not work for free. It would be a prank at the most. But
by what strange coincidence could pranksters have an understanding


                                   52

                               Introduction


amongst themselves from one end of the world to the other, leading
them to act in the same way to produce the same effects, and to give
identical answers on the same subjects in their various languages, if
not in the exact same words, at least implying the same meaning?
Why would serious, respectable and educated persons cater to such
maneuvers, and for what purpose? Why has the patience and skill
required for producing these phenomena been found even among
children? After all, unless mediums are mere passive instruments, it
is obvious that we would have to confer on them capabilities and
knowledge far beyond their age and social position.
       Next, our opponents state that if no fraud is involved, then both
parties – mediums and observers – might be deceived by an illusion.
There is no question that the quality of the witnesses does carry a
certain weight. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether the Spiritist
Doctrine, which today has millions of followers, only recruits from
among the uneducated. The phenomena on which Spiritism is based
seem so extraordinary that we can understand such doubt, but we
cannot accept the claim of certain skeptics that they hold a monopoly
on common sense: those who, without respect for the conventions
and moral values of their adversaries, label as incompetent all those
who do not agree with their opinions. For judicious persons, the
opinions of educated individuals who have observed, studied and
thought about a matter at length will always be, if not actual proof,
then a likely hypothesis at the very least; after all, Spiritism has grabbed
the attention of serious individuals who have neither an interest in
propagating an error nor time to waste on futilities.

                                    X

      Among our opponents’ objections there are some that are
more plausible, at least in appearance, because they are based on
observation and are raised by serious individuals.


                                    53

                              Introduction


       One such observation refers to the language of certain spirits,
which does not seem worthy of the loftiness that might be attributed
to supernatural beings. However, if we refer to the summary of the
Doctrine presented above, we will see that the Spirits themselves
teach us that they are not all equal to one another in knowledge or
moral qualities, and that we must not take everything that spirits
tell us at face value. It falls to sensible persons to separate the good
from the bad. Obviously, those who conclude from this fact that
we deal solely with evil beings whose sole intention is to deceive,
are unfamiliar with the communications given during meetings in
which high order spirits manifest; if they were, they would think
otherwise. It is unfortunate that chance has served these persons so
badly by showing them only the decadent side of the spirit world.
On the other hand, we do not want to presume that an affinity of
inclinations might have attracted evil, deceitful, and foul-mouthed
spirits to them rather than good ones. We could conclude, at most,
that the strength of their principles is not solid enough to preserve
them from evil, and since they find a certain pleasure in satisfying
their own curiosity, evil spirits take advantage of this fact to mingle
with them, whereas good spirits stay away.
       Judging the character of spirits by such facts would be as
illogical as judging the character of an entire people by what is
said and done in a group of a few wild or disreputable individuals
who do not deserve the company of either learned or sensible
persons. Those who judge in this way are like foreigners who enter
a great capital by way of the worst outskirts and then proceed to
judge the entire population of the city according to the customs
and speech of this one neighborhood. In the spirit world, there is
also a good and an evil society. If such individuals would actually
study what happens among high orded spirits, they would realize
that the celestial city does not contain only the dregs of society.
Nonetheless, they might ask: Do high order spirits really come to


                                  54

                            Introduction


us? And we would reply: Do not remain on the outskirts; watch,
observe and judge for yourselves. The facts are here for everybody
to see, except those to whom the words of Jesus apply, “they have
eyes but do not see; they have ears but do not hear.”
       A different variation on this opinion considers all spirit
communications and all physical manifestations as being nothing
more than the intervention of some diabolical power, a new
Proteus, who can assume any form it wants in order to better
deceive us. We do not consider such an idea to be worthy of
serious examination, and thus will not dwell on here: it has already
been refuted by what we stated earlier. We would only add that,
if such were the case, we would have to concede that the Devil is
sometimes very wise, very reasonable, and especially, very moral –
or that there are good devils.
       In fact, how could we believe that God would allow only the
Spirit of Evil to manifest himself in order to deceive us, without
providing us the counsels of good spirits as a counterweight? If
God could not do so, it would imply powerlessness; if God could
but did not, it would be incompatible with divine goodness. Either
supposition would of course be blasphemous. However, we would
like to emphasize that accepting the fact that evil spirits do really
communicate means accepting the fact that spirit manifestations
do really occur. And since they do occur, it is only with divine
permission. Without being impious, how can we believe that God
would permit only evil manifestations to the exclusion of good
ones? Such a doctrine is contrary both to the simplest notions of
common sense and religion.

                                XI

     Other opponents add that it is strange that we seem to
concern ourselves only with the spirits of well-known individuals


                                 55

                             Introduction


and they ask why these are the only ones who manifest. Like many
other errors, this one comes from superficial observation. Among
the spirits who manifest spontaneously, those who are unknown
outnumber the illustrious ones; they often take names that are
allegorical or in keeping with their character. As for those whom
we evoke – except in the case of relatives or friends – it is quite
natural that we would prefer those we know rather than those we
do not know. As for illustrious personalities, they are the ones who
are noticed more and so they attract more attention.
       These opponents also consider it strange that the spirits of
eminent individuals casually respond to our appeal, and that they
sometimes concern themselves with matters that seem insignificant
when compared to what they accomplished during their lives.
However, this is not so surprising to those who know that the
power and respect that such individuals enjoyed on earth do not
necessarily entitle them to any supremacy in the spirit world. The
Spirits confirm the Gospel words, “the great shall be abased, and
the small shall be exalted,” which must be understood as relating
to the position each of us will occupy among them. Thus, those
who had been first on the earth may find themselves among the
last in the spirit world. Those who make us bow to them in this
life may return as the most humble laborers, for when they leave
the earthly life behind, they leave all their grandeur behind as well.
The most powerful monarchs might find themselves to be below
their lowest ranking soldiers.

                                XII

      A fact borne out by observation and confirmed by the Spirits
themselves is that low order spirits often present themselves using
well-known and respected names. Thus, how can we be sure that
those who say that they had been, for example, Socrates, Julius


                                 56

                               Introduction


Caesar, Charlemagne, Fenelon, Napoleon, Washington, etc., had
really animated those individuals? This question has been raised
even among some earnest followers of the Spiritist Doctrine. They
accept the intervention and manifestation of spirits, but they ask
what control we may have over their identity. Such control can
indeed be very difficult to establish, but although identities cannot
be verified in a way that is as authentic as the attestation of public
records, they may nonetheless at least be verified by deduction
according to certain indicators.
        When spirits of those personally known to us (relatives or friends,
for example – especially if they have only recently died) manifest, their
language usually corresponds perfectly to the characteristics that were
familiar to us. This in itself is an indication of identity. Any remaining
doubts, however, are settled when such spirits speak of private affairs
or remember family matters known only to those involved. A son
could hardly be mistaken about the language of his father or mother,
nor parents about the language of their child. During these intimate
evocations the most extraordinary incidents sometimes occur,
convincing even the most incredulous. Hardened skeptics are often
startled by the unexpected revelations made to them.
        One other characteristic of such communications is often
enough to verify a spirit’s identity: handwriting. As we have stated,
a medium’s handwriting generally changes with the spirit who is
evoked, reproducing it exactly the same each time the same spirit
communicates. In cases involving persons recently deceased, it has
been demonstrated innumerable times that the handwriting reveals
striking similarities to that of the person during life – we have seen
perfectly identical signatures. Nevertheless, we are far from citing
this fact as a rule or as a frequent occurrence. We simply mention
it as something worth noting.
        Spirits who have reached a certain degree of purity are
the only ones who are free of all corporeal influences. As long as


                                    57

                                      Introduction


they are not yet completely dematerialized (this is the expression
they use), they preserve most of the ideas, inclinations and even
idiosyncrasies they had on earth, and this is a further means
of recognizing them. Above all, however, we arrive at such
recognition through a multitude of details that only an attentive
and continuous observation can reveal. We have observed spirits
who had been authors discussing their own works or doctrines,
approving or condemning certain parts of them, and others
remembering unknown or little-known circumstances concerning
their life or death. All these indications, which are at least typical
evidence of identity, are the only ones that can be employed when
dealing with abstract matters.
       Hence, if the identity of an evoked spirit may be established
to a certain extent in certain cases, then there is no reason why it
cannot be established in others. And although we do not have the
same means of control involving persons who died at a more remote
time, we always have the means of referring to their language and
character; that is, the spirit of a morally upright person will never
communicate like the spirit of a perverse or immoral one. As for
spirits who assume respectable names, they soon betray themselves
by their language and maxims. For instance, a spirit claiming to
be Fenelon17, but who unexpectedly offended common sense and
good morals, would thereby expose its charade. But if the thoughts
expressed were always pure, without contradiction and consistent
with the elevated character of Fenelon, there would be no reason to
doubt the spirit’s identity. If such were not the case, one would have
to believe that a spirit who is known to proclaim what is morally
right could at the same time resort to useless falsities. Experience
has taught us that spirits of the same degree and character, and
who are animated by the same sentiments, are united into groups
and families. Thus, the number of spirits is incalculable and we are

far from knowing them all – most remain nameless to us. A spirit
of the same category as Fenelon may therefore come in his stead
and may even be sent by him, presenting itself under his name
because it is identical to him and may act as his substitute, and
because it provides us with a name so that we can focus our ideas.
After all, what does it really matter if the spirit is or is not Fenelon
himself? If it only talks about noble matters in a way in which
Fenelon himself would have talked, it is a good spirit. The name
it uses does not matter and it is frequently no more than a means
for us to fix our thought. However, in more intimate evocations
the same does not apply because, as we have already stated, an
identity can be established by means of proofs that are in one way
or another obvious.
       There is no doubt that spirit substitution may occasion
a number of mistakes that result in errors, and oftentimes,
deceit. Such is one of the difficulties faced by practical Spiritism.
However, we have never said that this science is easy, or that it
may be learned effortlessly, as is also the case with any other
science. We cannot repeat too often that Spiritism demands
constant and prolonged study, and that since we cannot produce
spirit phenomena at will, we must wait for them to occur on
their own, frequently when we least expect it. For attentive and
patient observers the facts are abundant, for they can discover
thousands of characteristic nuances that appear to them like rays
of light. The same applies to every other branch of science: while
the superficial observer sees in a flower only an elegant form, the
botanist discovers in it treasures for thought.

                                 XIII

       These observations lead us to address another difficulty: the
differences in spirits’ language.


                                  59

                             Introduction


       Since spirits differ widely from each other in knowledge and
morality, it is obvious that the same question may receive varied,
sometimes contradictory answers from them according to their
category. The same would happen if we were to question a scholar,
an uneducated person or a prankster. What is essential is to know
to whom we are addressing our question.
       But – one may ask – how are we to explain why even high
order spirits do not always agree with one another? First, we will
state that besides the reason we have just pointed out, there are
others that may influence the nature of the responses, regardless of
the degree of the spirits’ evolution. This is a very important point
that will be explained by further study, lending credence to our
advice for constant attention, in-depth observation, and above all,
as with all human sciences, continuity and perseverance. Years are
required to make even a mediocre physician, and three quarters
of a lifetime to make a true scholar. So how can one expect to
obtain the wisdom of the infinite in only a few hours! Therefore,
let no one be misled: the study of Spiritism is infinitely immense
and is connected to all the issues of metaphysics and the social
order. There is an entire world opening before us, so why is it so
surprising that understanding it will require a great deal of time?
       Furthermore, apparent contradictions are not always as real as
they may appear to be at first. After all, do we not see scholars every
day who profess the same science but diverge in their definitions
by employing different terminology or by viewing a matter from
a different point of view, although the fundamental idea is still the
same? Just try to count the number of definitions given to the word
grammar! We must add that the form of an answer almost always
depends on the form of the question. Thus, it would be immature to
see a contradiction where there is generally no more than a difference
of words. High order spirits do not concern themselves with form at
all. For them, the essence of the thought itself is everything.


                                  60

                             Introduction


        For example, let us return to the definition of soul. Since
this word has no single definition, the Spirits may differ as to its
application just as we do. One will state that it is the principle of
life; another may call it the animic spark; a third may say that it
is something internal, while a fourth may say that it is something
external, etc., and all will be correct from their own point of view.
We might even think that some among them profess materialistic
theories, and yet such is not the case. The same applies with
respect to the word God. According to some, God is the Principle
of all things; according to others, the Creator of the universe, the
Supreme Intelligence, the Infinite, the Great Spirit, etc., but it is
always God. We would cite the classification of spirits as another
example. They form an uninterrupted series from the lowest to
the highest degree, and classifying them is therefore arbitrary.
One person might categorize them into three classes; others, into
five, ten or twenty as desired, without being incorrect. All human
sciences offer the same example, with each scholar having his or her
own system – the systems vary, but the science is always the same.
Whether we learn botany according to the system of Linnaeus,
Jussieu or Tournefort, we are learning botany nonetheless. With
this in mind, let us stop giving purely conventional matters more
importance than they deserve. Let us devote ourselves only to
what is truly important, and we will realize that in things that
seem most contradictory, we will often, upon reflection, discover a
similarity that escaped us in our first examination.

                                XIV

      We would pass right over the objection of certain skeptics
who point out the spelling errors of some spirits if it did not provide
us with an essential observation. We must agree that their spelling is
not always faultless, but only a lack of reasonable arguments could


                                  61

                               Introduction


make such a fact the target of serious criticism by stating that if spirits
know everything, they should know how to spell. We could point out
numerous sins of this nature committed by earthly scholars, which
in no way lessens their authority. However, the matter involves a
more serious issue. For spirits, and especially for high order ones,
the idea is everything; the form is nothing. Freed from matter, their
speech is as rapid as thought, and it is through thought itself that they
communicate with one another without intermediary means. Thus,
they must find it very inconvenient having to use the drawn out and
cumbersome forms of human language – especially its insufficiency
and imperfections – in communicating with us to express all their
ideas. They themselves have alluded to this fact, and it is interesting
to observe the means they utilize to minimize the inconvenience.
The same would apply to us if we had to express ourselves in a
language composed of longer words and sentences, and containing
fewer expressions than ours. It is the same type of difficulty that
geniuses experience: they become impatient with the slowness of the
pen as it always lags behind their thought. Thus, we can understand
why the Spirits attach little importance to orthographic trivialities,
especially when dealing with a profound and serious teaching. On
the other hand, is it not marvelous that they can express themselves
equally well in all languages and that they understand them all? We
must not conclude from this, however, that they do not understand
the conventional correctness of language since they observe it when
necessary. For example, the poetry they dictate almost always defies
the criticism of the most demanding purist in spite of the ignorance
of the medium.

                                   XV

      There are still individuals who see peril everywhere and in
everything they are unfamiliar with, and there is no lack of those


                                    62

                             Introduction


who have drawn unfavorable conclusions about Spiritism from the
fact that some individuals have become so involved in studying
it that they have lost their minds. But how could reasonable
people accept this argument? Does the same not happen with all
intellectual pursuits when the mind is weak? How many lunatics
and maniacs have been produced by the study of mathematics,
medicine, music, philosophy, etc.? Should we therefore ban
studying them? What does that prove? Through physical labor one
can injure one’s arms and legs, the instruments of physical action;
through mental labors one can injure the brain, the instrument of
thought. However, even if the instrument is broken, the spirit is
not – it remains intact. Once freed from matter, it will again enjoy
the fullness of its faculties. In its field and as an individual it is
simply a martyr to its work.
       All great intellectual pursuits may cause madness: the
sciences, the arts and even religion have all supplied their
contingents. Insanity has an organic predisposition of the brain as
its primary cause, making it more susceptible or less so to certain
impressions. Whenever this predisposition exists, it shows up in a
person’s main preoccupation, turning it into a fixation. It may be
about spirits for those who occupy themselves with that particular
subject; it may involve God, angels, the Devil, fortune, power, the
arts, a science, motherhood, or a political or social theory. Victims
of religious insanity would probably become insane Spiritists if
Spiritism were their predominant preoccupation, just as insane
Spiritists would express their madness under other forms if the
circumstances were different.
       I therefore state that Spiritism is not especially privileged in
this respect. However, I will go even farther and state that Spiritism
rightly understood is a safeguard against insanity.
       Among the most frequent causes of cerebral over-excitement
we should count disappointments, misfortunes and broken hearts,


                                  63

                             Introduction


which are all the most frequent causes of suicide. But true Spiritists
see the things of this world from a much higher point of view. They
seem tiny and petty to them in light of the future awaiting them.
Life is so short and fleeting that its troubles seem like nothing
more than the unpleasant incidents of a journey. Things that in
other individuals would produce violent emotions affect Spiritists
but little, for they know that life’s sorrows are trials that lead to
advancement if they endure them without complaining, and that
they will be rewarded according to the courage with which they
have borne them. Their convictions give them a resignation that
safeguards them against despair, a frequent cause of insanity and
suicide. Furthermore, through spirit communications Spiritists
know the fate of those who intentionally shorten their days, and
that picture is sufficient to make them stop and think. Thus, the
number of those who have been deterred at the brink of that
deadly precipice is considerable – one of the results of Spiritism.
The incredulous can laugh all they want. Nevertheless, I wish for
them the same consolation Spiritism has provided to all those who
have put forth the effort to probe its mysterious depths.
       Among the causes of insanity we must also include fear. For
instance, fear of the Devil has deranged more than a few minds,
and who knows the number of victims whose weak imaginations
had been impressed with the threat of the Devil, a threat which
becomes even more terrifying through hideous details. Some say
that the Devil, as well as the Bogeyman and the Werewolf, is only
used to frighten children in order make them behave. However,
when these children no longer fear the Devil, they become
naughtier than ever. In trying to control their behavior, those who
use such stories do not take into account the mental health risks
of scaring such delicate minds. Religion would be quite weak if a
lack of fear were to compromise its power. Fortunately, this is not
the case. Religion has other ways of acting on souls, and Spiritism


                                 64

                             Introduction


could furnish it with highly effective and serious tools, if religion
knew how to utilize them. Spiritism shows the reality of things
and thus neutralizes the dreadful effects of exaggerated fear.

                                XVI

       Two objections still remain to be examined: the only ones
that really deserve the label because they are supported by rational
theories. Both accept the reality of all the material and mental
phenomena, but they discount the intervention of spirits.
       According to the first of these theories, all the manifestations
attributed to spirits are merely effects of magnetism and mediums
remain in a state known as waking somnambulism, a phenomenon
witnessed by all who have studied magnetism. In this state, the
mental faculties acquire an abnormal development and the circles
of intuitive perception are extended beyond the limits of ordinary
perception. In this state, mediums draw from themselves and
their own lucidity all they say and all the ideas they transmit, even
regarding matters that are foreign to them in their normal state.
       We will not be the ones who contest the power of
somnambulism since we have witnessed its wonders by having
studied all its facets for over thirty-five years. In fact, we agree
that many spirit manifestations may be explained in this way.
Nevertheless, extensive and conscientious observation has shown
us a multitude of occurrences in which any participation by the
medium, except as a passive instrument, is materially impossible.
To those who share in this theory we will therefore say, as we have
already said to all others: Watch and observe, for you have certainly
not seen everything yet. Next, we will contrast two considerations
taken from their own doctrine. Where did the Spiritist theory
come from? Is it a theory dreamed up by a few individuals in order
to explain the phenomena? Not at all. But then who did reveal

it? The very mediums whose lucidity they extol. However, if this
lucidity is as great as they presume, why would these mediums have
attributed to spirits what they supposedly produced themselves?
How could they have given such precise, logical and sublime
information regarding the nature of supra-human intelligences?
One of two things applies: either they are lucid or they are not. If
they are, and if we can rely on their truthfulness, then it would be
contradictory to claim that they do not speak the truth. Second,
if all the phenomena proceed from the mediums themselves, they
should always be identical for the same individual, and we would
not observe the same person communicating in different languages
or alternately expressing matters that are completely contradictory.
This lack of unity in the manifestations obtained by the same
medium proves the diversity of their sources, and since we cannot
find all these sources in the medium, we must look elsewhere.
        According to the second theory, mediums really are the
source of the manifestations, but instead of producing them from
within themselves, they draw them from their surroundings.
The medium is a kind of mirror, reflecting all the thoughts,
ideas and knowledge of the other participants; thus, the medium
reveals nothing that is not known to at least some of the others.
We cannot deny – and from this arises one of the fundamental
principles of the Doctrine – the participants’ influence on the
nature of the manifestations. But this influence is very different
from what is assumed here, and there is a great distance between
it and the medium being the mere echo of the thoughts of others,
because thousands of occurrences have peremptorily shown just
the opposite. Therefore, this theory contains a serious error, which
once again proves the danger of premature conclusions. Since
those who hold to this theory are unable to deny the existence of a
phenomenon that ordinary science cannot explain, and since they
cannot accept the intervention of spirits, they explain the matter in


                                 66

                             Introduction


their own way. Their theory would be alluring if it could explain all
the phenomena, but it cannot. And when the evidence obviously
shows that some of the communications through the medium are
entirely foreign to the thoughts, knowledge and opinions of any
of those who are present, and that they are often spontaneous and
contradict all preconceived ideas, our opponents are not bothered
in the least by this fact. They respond that thought waves go far
beyond the immediate circle, and that mediums are a reflection of
all humankind. Thus, if they cannot receive inspiration from their
immediate surroundings, they go in search of it elsewhere – in the
city, the country, the entire world, and even on other spheres.
       We do not believe that this theory offers a simpler and
more plausible explanation than that given by Spiritism, since it
supposes a much more incredible cause. The notion that universal
space is full of beings who are in continuous contact with us and
who communicate their ideas to us is no more shocking to our
reason than the supposition of universal thought waves coming
from every point of the universe to converge on the mind of a
single individual.
       We would repeat – and this is the crucial point that we must
insist on – that the somnambulism theory and the one we may call
the reflection theory were dreamed up by certain persons; they are
individual opinions that were formulated to explain a phenomenon,
while the Doctrine of the Spirits is not a human concept at all. It
was revealed by the manifesting intelligences themselves when no
one had even imagined it and when general opinion was opposed
to it. Therefore, we must ask: Where did mediums come up with
a doctrine that did not exist in the thought of anyone on earth?
Furthermore, is it not a strange coincidence that thousands of
mediums scattered all over the entire globe, and who had never met
one another before, all agreed on stating the same thing? If the first
medium who appeared in France was influenced by opinions that


                                 67

                             Introduction


had already been accepted in America, by what strange impulse
did he go in search of ideas three thousand miles across the ocean
and among people whose habits and language were foreign to him,
instead of taking what was immediately around him?
       There is another circumstance that has not received enough
thought, however. The earliest manifestations in both France and
America did not take place either by writing or by speech, but by
raps corresponding to the letters of the alphabet to form words and
sentences. This was the way the manifesting intelligences originally
declared themselves to be spirits. Therefore, even if we were to
assume the intervention of the medium’s own thought in the verbal
or written communications, the same could not be said regarding
the raps; their significance could not have been known beforehand.
       We could cite numerous facts that demonstrate the presence
of an obvious individuality with a completely independent will on
the part of the manifesting intelligence. We invite our opponents
to make a more careful observation. If they were to study the matter
more closely, without prejudice, and not draw any conclusions
before having seen all that is necessary, they would recognize the
true ineffectiveness of their theory to explain all the facts. We will
limit ourselves to proposing the following questions: Why does
the manifesting intelligence, whatever it may be, refuse to answer
certain questions regarding subjects that are perfectly known
about, such as the name and age of the questioners, what they
have in their hands, what they did yesterday, what they intend to
do tomorrow, etc.? If the medium is only a mirror reflecting the
thoughts of the participants, nothing should be easier to answer.
       In response, our adversaries ask us why spirits – who must
know everything – cannot answer such simple questions, according
to the axiom, “Whoever can do the most can do the least.” Based on
this, they conclude that the entities are not spirits at all. We in
turn will respond by asking what would happen if an uneducated


                                 68

                            Introduction


individual or a prankster appeared before a group of learned
scholars and asked, for example, what makes the day so light at
noontime. Do you think they would respond seriously, and would
it be logical to conclude from the silence or the scorn directed at
the questioner that they were all fools? It is precisely because such
spirits are of a high order that they do not respond to idle or silly
questions; they do not like to be cross examined. That is why they
remain silent or advise us that they will only concern themselves
with more serious matters.
       Finally, we would ask why spirits come and go, often in an
instant, and why neither prayer nor begging can make them return
after they have gone. If a medium only acts under the mental
impulse of the other participants, it would seem obvious that in
such a circumstance the agreement of all the joined wills should
be able to stimulate the medium’s clairvoyance. Therefore, if the
medium cannot comply with the wishes of the other participants,
even though concurring with his or her own will, it is because both
the medium and the others are obeying an outside influence, and this
influence is demonstrating its own independence and individuality.

                               XVII

       When it is not the result of systematic opposition from
selfish motives, skepticism with regard to the Spiritist Doctrine
almost always stems from an imperfect understanding of the
facts; however, this does not seem to prevent certain persons
from trying to settle the issue as though they understood it
perfectly. It is possible to be highly imaginative and even highly
educated, and yet lack common sense, and one of the first
indications of a lack of common sense is belief in one’s own
infallibility. Lastly, many persons see in spirit manifestations
nothing more than a matter of curiosity. We would hope that by

                             Introduction


reading this book they will find in such remarkable phenomena
something more than a simple pastime.
        Spiritist Science consists of two aspects: the experimental
deals with manifestations in general, whereas the philosophical
deals with intelligent manifestations. Whoever has observed only
the former is like someone who only knows about physics from
recreational experiments, without having delved into the science
itself. The true Spiritist Doctrine is found in the teachings imparted
by the Spirits, and the knowledge of this teaching is far too serious
to be acquired in any other way than an in-depth and continuous
study made in silence and reflection on the matter. Only under
such conditions can one examine the infinite number of facts
and nuances which have escaped many superficial observers and
have consequently led them to form their own opinions. If this
book had no other purpose than to show the serious aspect of the
subject and to induce the study of it, that would be sufficient and
we would be happy to have been chosen to carry out a work for
which we ourselves do not intend to gain any personal merit. Its
principles are not of our own creation; the merit goes entirely to
the Spirits who have dictated them. We hope that it will produce
a further result, i.e. that of guiding those who desire to learn,
showing them in their studies the grand and sublime objective of
individual and social progress, and pointing out to them the road
to follow for its accomplishment.
        We will conclude with a final consideration. In their probing
of outer space, astronomers discovered among the scattered
celestial bodies unexplainable vacant spots that did not seem to
abide by the laws of the whole. They therefore speculated that such
vacant spots were occupied by bodies that had escaped previous
observation. In addition, they observed certain effects, whose cause
was unknown to them and they said to themselves: “There must
be a world there because such a gap should not exist and because


                                 70

                             Introduction


such effects must have a cause.” Then, by judging the cause by
the effects, they were able to calculate the orbital elements, and
later the facts appeared, proving their predictions. Let us apply this
same reasoning to another order of ideas. If we were to observe the
series of living beings in nature, we would realize that they form
an unending chain of continuity from raw matter up to the most
intelligent human being. But between human beings and God –
the Alpha and Omega of all things – what a huge gap there appears
to be! Would it be reasonable to suppose that humans are the final
link in this chain? That they transcend, without transition, the
distance that separates them from the Infinite? Reason tells us that
there must be other links between humans and God, just as reason
told those astronomers that amongst the worlds they already knew
about there had to be others. What other philosophy has filled
that huge gap? Spiritism shows that it is filled with beings of all
categories of the invisible world, and that these beings are none
other than the spirits of humans in the different degrees leading to
perfection. Thus, everything is linked together; everything forms a
chain from the Alpha to the Omega. You, who deny the existence
of spirits, go ahead and try to fill the gap they occupy. You, who
laugh at them, go ahead and dare to laugh at the works of God and
the divine omnipotence!

        Phenomena that escape the laws of ordinary science are
manifesting everywhere and are revealing the action of a free and
intelligent will as their cause.
        Reason tells us that an intelligent effect must have an
intelligent force as its cause, and the facts have shown that this force
can communicate with human beings through physical means.
        When questioned about its nature, this force has declared
itself to belong to the world of spirit beings who have divested
themselves of the human corporeal envelope. In this way, the
Doctrine of the Spirits has been revealed.
        Communications between the spirit world and the corporeal
world belong to nature itself and there is nothing supernatural about
them. That is why we have found traces of such communications
among all cultures and throughout history. Nowadays, they are
commonplace and obvious to the whole world.
        The Spirits have announced that the time appointed by
Providence for a universal manifestation has now come and that as
ministers of God and agents of the divine will, their mission is to
instruct and enlighten men and women, opening a new era for the
regeneration of humankind.
        This book is a compilation of their teachings. It has been
written at the order and under the dictation of high order spirits

                                  73

                             Prolegomena


in order to establish the bases of a rational philosophy free from
the prejudices of preconceived notions. It does not contain
anything that is not the expression of their thought or that has
not been submitted for their approval. The order and methodical
arrangement of the contents, as well as the textual comments
and the form of some parts of the redaction, are the only aspects
contributed by the one who received the mission of publishing it.
       Among the number of the Spirits who have taken part in
accomplishing this task, there are many who have lived at one time
or another upon the earth, where they proclaimed and practiced
virtue and wisdom. Others do not bear the name of any personage
whose memory history has kept alive, but their elevated status is
attested to by the purity of their doctrine and their unity with
those who bear venerated names.
       Following are the written terms received through several
mediums, and in which the Spirits have given us the mission of
preparing this book:
       “Be zealous and persevering in this work you have
undertaken with our assistance, for this work is ours. In it we have
laid the foundations of the new edifice destined to someday unite
all humankind in one and the same sentiment of love and charity.
However, before you publish it, we will review it together to make
sure of all the details.
       “We shall be with you whenever you ask for our presence in
order to aid you in the rest of your labors, for this book is only one
part of the mission which has been entrusted to you and which
one of us has already revealed to you.
       “Among the teachings that will be given to you, there are
some that you must keep solely to yourself for the time being;
we will advise you when the time has come to publish them.
Meanwhile, meditate on them so that you will be ready when we
tell you.

       “At the beginning of the book you are to put the vine-branch
that we designed18 because it is the emblem of the Creator’s work.
All the material elements that best represent the body and the spirit
are united in it: the body is the stem; the spirit is the sap; the soul
or spirit connected to the body is the cluster of grapes. Human
beings elevate and purify their spirits through labor, and you know
that it is only through hard work in the corporeal existence that
the spirit acquires knowledge.
       “Do not allow yourself to be discouraged by criticism. You
will encounter bitter enemies, especially among those interested in
deceit. You will even find enemies among spirits, for those who are
not completely dematerialized often seek to sow the seeds of doubt
through malice and ignorance. Carry on nonetheless; believe in God
and boldly move forward. We shall be with you to uphold you. The
time is at hand when the truth will shine forth everywhere.
       “The vanity of some individuals who think they know
everything and want to explain everything in their own way will
give rise to dissenting opinions. However, all who have the grand
principle of Jesus in mind will be united in the same sentiment
of love of the good and will be bound by a fraternal tie that will
embrace the entire world. People will put aside all petty disputes
about words in order to concern themselves solely with essential
matters, and the Doctrine will always be the same at the foundation
for all who receive communications from high order spirits.
       “It is through your perseverance that you will harvest the
fruit of your labors. The satisfaction you will feel in seeing the
Doctrine spread and correctly understood will be a reward for
you, and you will perhaps realize its full value more in the future
than in the present. Do not be troubled because of the thorns and
stones that disbelievers and evil individuals will scatter along your

path. Hold on to your confidence; through it you will reach your
goal and you will always merit our help.
      “Remember that good spirits only aid those who serve God
with humility and a lack of self-interest. They repudiate anyone
who uses the way of heaven as a stepping-stone to earthly things,
and they withdraw from the proud and ambitious. Pride and
ambition will always be barriers between human beings and God;
they are a veil thrown over the celestial splendors, and God cannot
use the blind to explain the light.”

 Author’s note to the second edition:
 The principles contained in this book result either from the responses given by the Spirits
 to questions directed to them at various times and through a great number of mediums, or
 from the spontaneous teachings given to us and to other persons concerning the matter
 at hand. The work has been coordinated so as to present a regular and methodical whole
 and was submitted for publication only after it was carefully reviewed and corrected
 by the Spirits themselves. This second edition has been the object of new and detailed
 scrutiny.
 The material placed between quotation marks following the questions represents the
 textual replies made by the Spirits. The material set off in different type or designated in a
 special way comprises the comments or expositions added by the author, and which were
 thoroughly supervised by the Spirits.

1.        What is God?
          “God is the Supreme Intelligence, the First Cause of all
          things.”19
2.        What is meant by the Infinite?
          “That which has neither beginning nor end: the unknown.
          All which is unknown is infinite.”

          “That would be an incomplete definition. Human speech
          is too impoverished and insufficient to define that which
          transcends human intelligence.”
             God is infinite in divine perfection, but the Infinite itself is an
             abstract concept. Thus, to say that God is the Infinite is to replace the

       thing itself with one of its attributes; it is to define something that
       is unknown by referring to something else that is equally unknown.



       Proofs of the Existence of God
4.   Where may we find proof for the existence of God?
     “In an axiom you apply to all your sciences: ‘There is no
     effect without a cause.’ If you would search for the cause
     of whatever is not the work of human beings, then reason
     will answer your question.”
       To believe in God, we need only to behold the works of creation.
       The universe exists; therefore, it must have a cause. To doubt God’s
       existence would be to deny that every effect has a cause and to
       believe that something could have resulted from nothingness.

5.   All human beings have within them the intuitive sentiment
     of God’s existence. What can we conclude from this?
     “That God exists; otherwise, where would such a sentiment
     come from if it were not based on something real? This
     is an application of the principle that there is no effect
     without a cause.”
6.   Mightn’t our inner sentiment about the existence of God be
     the result of education and the product of acquired ideas?
     “If that were the case, why would members of your
     primitive cultures have this intuition?”
       If the sentiment of the existence of a Supreme Being were only
       the product of education, it would not be universal. Like all
       scientific ideas, it would only exist in the minds of those who
       received such education.

7.   Could we find the first cause of the formation of things in the
     innermost properties of matter?


                                  80

                                God


     “Even if you could, what in turn would be the cause of
     those properties? There must always be a first cause.”
      To attribute the first formation of things to the innermost
      properties of matter would be to mistake the effect for the cause
      since such properties are themselves an effect that must have had
      a prior cause.

8.   What about the idea that attributes the first formation of all
     things to an accidental combination of matter, i.e. to chance?
     “Another absurdity! How could anyone with any common
     sense believe that chance is an intelligent agent? Moreover,
     what is chance? Nothing.”
      The harmony that governs the forces of the universe reveals certain
      set combinations and designs, and thus an intelligent power. To
      attribute the first formation of things to chance would be nonsense
      because chance is blind and cannot produce intelligent results. An
      intelligent chance would no longer be chance.

9.   Where may we see in the first cause a Supreme Intelligence,
     superior to all other intelligences?
     “You have a proverb that says, ‘The workman is known
     by his work.’ So, look at the work and you will find the
     ‘Workman’! Pride is what creates disbelief. Human pride
     believes in nothing above itself, and that is why people
     think they are so powerful. Poor beings! A mere breath
     from God could blow them over!”
      We judge the power of an intelligence by its works. Since no human
      being could create what nature produces, it is obvious that the first
      cause must be an intelligence superior to humankind.
      Whatever may be the marvels accomplished by human
      intelligence, such intelligence itself must have a cause; the
      greater the results, the greater the first cause must have been. No
      matter what name you give it, that intelligence is the first cause
      of all things.

                        Part One – Chapter I


         The Attributes of the Divinity
10.   Can human beings fathom God’s innermost nature?
      “No, they lack the aptitude to comprehend it.”
11.   Will they ever be able to fathom the mystery of the Divinity?
      “When their spirits are no longer eclipsed by matter, and
      when they have finally purified themselves enough to be able
      to approach God, then they will see and comprehend God.”
       The inferior nature of their faculties makes it impossible for human
       beings to fathom God’s innermost nature. While humanity is in its
       infancy, people often confuse God with God’s creatures, imputing
       to God their own imperfections. However, they ponder the nature
       of things more deeply as their moral sense develops and thus they
       acquire a truer – though always incomplete – idea of God that
       conforms more to reason.

12.   Even though we cannot fathom God’s innermost nature, can
      we get an idea of some of the divine perfections?
      “Yes, some of them. Human beings comprehend them
      better only as they progressively overcome matter, but they
      can at least get glimpses of them through thought.”
13.   When we state that God is eternal, infinite, immutable,
      immaterial, one, all-powerful, and supremely just and good,
      don’t we have a complete idea of God’s attributes?
      “From your own point of view, yes, because you believe
      that in so stating them you therefore have named all of
      them. Nevertheless, you should understand that there are
      things that transcend the intelligence of the most intelligent
      person, things your language cannot define, because it is
      limited to your ideas and sensations. Your reason tells you
      that God must be perfect in those attributes to the nth
      degree, for if God lacked any of them or was not perfect

                                 82

                                   God


      in them to the nth degree, God would not be superior to
      everything else, and thus would not be God. In order to be
      superior to everything else, God must not be subject to any
      change and must not be imperfect in any way imaginable.”
        God is eternal. If God had had a beginning, then either God would
        have had to have sprung from nothing or would have had to have
        been created by a being that existed previously. Reasoning in this
        way, we arrive little by little at the idea of eternity and the infinite.
        God is immutable. If God were subject to change, then the laws that
        govern the universe would have no stability.
        God is immaterial. This means that God’s nature differs from
        everything we call matter; otherwise, God would not be immutable
        but would be subject to the transformations of matter.
        God is one. If there were several gods, then there would be no unity
        of design or power in the organization of the universe.
        God is all-powerful because God is one. If God were not powerful
        above all else, it would mean that there was something more
        powerful or at least as powerful. It would mean that God might not
        have created all things, and those that God did not create would
        have had to have been the work of some other god.
        God is supremely just and good. The providential wisdom in the
        divine laws is revealed in the smallest things as well as in the largest,
        and this wisdom makes it impossible for us to doubt either God’s
        justice or goodness.



                            Pantheism
14.   Is God a distinct being, or as some believe, the result of all the
      combined forces and intelligences of the universe?
      “If the latter were the case, God per se would not exist
      because God would be an effect and not a cause. God
      cannot be both cause and effect at the same time.

      “You cannot doubt that God exists and that is the point
      that matters. Believe me and do not try to go any farther.
      Do not get lost in a maze from which you will not be
      able to exit. Trying to go farther will not make you any
      better; instead, it will probably just add to your pride by
      leading you to imagine that you understand something
      when you actually understand nothing at all. Therefore,
      put all theories aside regarding the matter. You have much
      more important things to be concerned about, beginning
      with yourselves. Study your own imperfections in order to
      get rid of them; that will be far more useful to you than
      trying to penetrate the impenetrable.”
15.   What should we think of the opinion holding that all the
      bodies in nature, all the beings and globes in the universe are
      components of the Divinity, and taken all together comprise
      the Divinity itself; i.e. the pantheistic doctrine?
      “Since humans are unable to make themselves God, they
      would like to at least be a part of God.”
16.   Adherents of this theory claim that it demonstrates some of
      God’s attributes: since there are an infinite number of worlds,
      then God is infinite; since a void or absolute nothingness is
      nowhere, then God is everywhere. God being everywhere,
      because everything is an integral component of God, God
      infuses all the phenomena of nature with God’s intelligence.
      What can refute this viewpoint?
      “Reason. Reflect on it carefully and you will have no
      difficulty in seeing how absurd it is.”
        The pantheistic doctrine views God as a material being, who, even
        though possessed of supreme intelligence, is nevertheless only
        a larger version of us. Furthermore, since matter is continually
        changing, then God would have no stability and would be subject
        to all the changes and all the needs of humanity. God would thus


                                 84

                          God


lack one of the essential attributes of the Divinity: immutability.
The properties of matter cannot be linked to the idea of God
without impairing how we think about God, and all the subtleties
of sophistry will never be able to solve the issue of God’s innermost
nature. We do not know all that God is, but we do know what God
cannot fail to be. Pantheism contradicts the most essential divine
properties by confusing the Creator with the creature. It is like
regarding an ingenious machine as being an integral component of
the machinist who invented it.
God’s intelligence is revealed in God’s works, just like an artist’s
is revealed in his or her paintings; but God’s works are no more
actually God than the painting is the artist who conceived and
painted it.

                            CHAPTER II

                                M

       The General Elements
          of the Universe
       • The Knowledge of the Origin of Things • Spirit and
        Matter • The Properties of Matter • Universal Space



      The Knowledge of the Origin of Things
17.      Can humans know the origin of things?
         “No. On earth, God does not allow everything to be
         revealed to them.”
18.      Will they ever be able to grasp the mystery of things now
         hidden from them?
         “The veil is lifted as they become more and more purified,
         but in order to understand certain things they need
         faculties they do not yet have.”
19.      Can’t humans grasp some of nature’s secrets through scientific
         investigation?
         “Science has been given to them for their advancement
         in all matters, but they cannot go beyond the limits set
         by God.”


                                  87

                       Part One – Chapter II


       The more humans are allowed to grasp such mysteries, the more
       they should admire the power and wisdom of the Creator. However,
       whether through pride or through weakness, their own minds
       often render them victims of illusion and they pile theory upon
       theory. Every day they see how many errors they have mistaken for
       truths and how many truths they have dismissed as errors. These
       realizations are further blows to their pride.

20.   Outside the realm of scientific investigation, can humans
      receive communications of a higher order regarding matters
      that go beyond the scope of their senses?
      “Yes, if God deems it useful, God will reveal what science
      cannot detect.”
       It is through such communications that humans can, to a certain
       degree, know about their past and their future destiny.



                   Spirit and Matter
21.   Is matter eternal like God, or was it created at some specific
      time in the past?
      “Only God knows. Nevertheless, there is something
      you should realize by using your reason: God, the very
      personification of love and charity, has never been inactive.
      No matter how long ago you might imagine the onset of
      the divine action to have been, could you possibly conceive
      of God as ever having been idle for even one second?”
22.   Matter is generally defined as: that which has extension; that
      which can impress our senses; that which is impenetrable. Are
      these definitions correct?
      “From your own point of view they are correct because
      you can only talk about matters that are familiar to you.
      Matter, however, also exists in states that are unfamiliar.


                                88

                The General Elements of the Universe



      For example, it may be so ethereal and subtle that your
      senses cannot detect it; it is matter nonetheless, even
      though you do not perceive it as such.”
      – Then how may we define matter?
      “Matter is the tie that enchains spirit; it is the instrument
      that spirit uses and upon which it simultaneously exerts
      its action.”
        From this viewpoint, one could say that matter is the agent or
        intermediary that enables spirit to act while at the same time being
        acted upon by spirit.

23.   What is spirit?
      “The intelligent principle of the universe.”
      – What is spirit’s innermost nature?
      “It is not easy to explain spirit in your language. For
      you, it is nothing because it is not something palpable;
      nevertheless, for us it is something. You must realize that
      nothing means nothing and nothing does not exist.”
24.   Is spirit synonymous with intelligence?
      “Intelligence is one of the essential attributes of spirit, but
      both merge into a common principle; thus, for you they
      are one and the same thing.”
25.   Is spirit independent of matter, or is it only a property of matter,
      as colors are properties of light and as sound is a property of air?
      “They are distinct from each other, but the union of
      spirit and matter is necessary to enable matter to act
      intelligently.”
      – Is this union equally necessary for the manifestation of spirit?
      “For you it is necessary because you are not built to perceive


                                  89

                                  Part One – Chapter II


           spirit apart from matter. Your senses are not formed to do so.”
           (In this section we understand “spirit” to mean the intelligent
           principle, rather than the entities designated by the name).
26.        Can we conceive of spirit apart from matter, and matter apart
           from spirit?
           “Absolutely, through thought.”
27.        So are there two general elements in the universe: matter
           and spirit?
           “Yes, and over everything is God, the Creator and author
           of all. These three elements comprise the principle of all
           that exists – they are the universal trinity. However, to the
           element of matter must be added the universal fluid20,
           which plays an intermediary role between spirit and matter
           per se, since matter is too dense for spirit to act upon it
           directly. Although from a certain point of view this fluid
           may be regarded as part of the material element, it differs
           from it due to special properties. If it were simply matter,
           there would be no reason for spirit not to be matter too.
           It is placed between spirit and matter, yet it is a fluid, just
           as matter is matter. In its countless combinations with
           matter, and under the direction of spirit, it is capable
           of producing an infinite variety of things about which
           you still know very, very little. By being the agent upon
           which spirit acts, this universal, primitive or elementary
           fluid is the principle without which matter would forever
           remain in a state of dispersion; it would never acquire the
 		“... the universal cosmic fluid is the primitive elementary matter, whose modifications
20

  and transformations comprise the innumerable variety of bodies found in nature... As the
  universal elementary principle, it offers two distinct states: etherization or imponderability,
  which may be considered the normal primitive state, and materialization or ponderability,
  which is in a certain way only consecutive to the former. The intermediary point is the
  transormation of the fluid into tangible matter. However, even then there is not a brusque
  transition, because our imponderable fluids may be regarded as a halfway phase between
  the two states”. (Allan Kardec, Genesis, International Spiritist Council, 2009, p. 354). – Tr.



                                              90

                 The General Elements of the Universe



      properties given to it by gravitation.”
      – Might this fluid be what we call electricity?
      “We have stated that it is capable of countless combinations.
      What you call the electric and magnetic fluids are both
      modifications of the one universal fluid. Properly speaking,
      this fluid is a perfect and subtler matter that may be
      considered as being independent of matter per se.”
28.   Since spirit is something in and of itself, wouldn’t it be clearer
      and less subject to confusion to label these two general elements
      as “inert matter” and “intelligent matter”?
      “Words do not matter much to us. It is up to you to formulate
      your language in a way that you can understand one another.
      The disputes among you almost always arise because you cannot
      agree on the meanings of the words you use. Your language is
      incomplete regarding things that do not touch your senses.”
        One obvious fact dominates all theories: we see matter, which is not
        intelligent, and we see an intelligent principle that is independent
        of matter; nonetheless, the origin of and connection between these
        two are unknown to us. Whether they have a common origin and
        necessary points of contact between them, and whether intelligence
        has its own independent existence or is only a property or effect, as
        some claim, or even whether it is an emanation of the Divinity –
        this is all unknown to us. Matter and intelligence are distinct, as far
        as we are concerned; thus, we regard them as being two principles
        comprising the universe. Above these, however, we see an intelligence
        dominating and governing all others, and it differs from them due to
        its essential attributes: it is this supreme intelligence that we call God.



              The Properties of Matter
29.   Is ponderability an essential attribute of matter?


                                     91

                               Part One – Chapter II


          “Of matter as you understand it, yes, but not of matter
          considered as the universal fluid. The ethereal and subtle
          matter that forms this fluid is imponderable to you, and
          yet it is the very principle of your ponderable21 matter.”
            Ponderability is a relative property. Outside the gravitational pull
            of the globes, there is no weight – just as there is no up or down.

30.       Does matter consist of one or many elements?
          “One single primitive element. The bodies you regard as
          simple are not true elements, but rather transformations
          of the one primitive matter.”
31.       Where do the different properties of matter come from?
          “From the modifications that the elementary molecules undergo
          as a result of their combining under certain conditions.”
32.       Then wouldn’t flavors, odors, colors, sounds – even the poisonous
          or healing qualities of certain bodies – be no more than
          modifications of the one and the same primitive substance?
          “Yes, of course; and they only exist due to the disposition
          of the organs that are meant to perceive them.”
            This principle is proven by the fact that not all people perceive the
            qualities of objects in the same way: what one person finds tasty,
            another might find disgusting; what appears blue to one person
            may appear as red to another; something that is poisonous for some
            might be harmless or even healthy for others.

33.       Is the same elementary matter capable of undergoing all
          possible modifications and acquiring all possible properties?
          “Yes, and this is what you should understand when we say
          that ‘everything is in everything.’”22
 		Ponderable: Worth serious consideration or having appreciable weight (Webster’s, op.
21

  cit.), i.e. something material that can be studied. – Tr.

  using willpower to confer very different properties upon any given substance – water,

                     The General Elements of the Universe


            Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon and all the other elements we
            consider to be simple are only modifications of the one primitive
            substance. As it is yet impossible for us to go back to this substance
            except by thinking about it, the elements truly are elements to us, and
            without further ado we can consider them as such until further notice.

         – Doesn’t this theory affirm the opinion of those who do not
         believe in more than only two essential properties for matter:
         force and movement, and who believe that all the other
         properties are only secondary effects that vary according to the
         intensity of the force and direction of the movement?
         “This opinion is correct, but it should also add: according to the
         arrangement of the molecules; this may be seen, for example,
         in an opaque body that becomes transparent and vice versa.”
34.      Do molecules have a defined form?
         “Certainly, molecules have a form, but you are incapable
         of discerning it.”
         – Is this form constant or variable?
         “Constant for the primitive elementary molecules but
         variable for the secondary ones, which are only aggregations
         of the former. However, what you term a molecule is still
         very far from being the elementary molecule.”


                            Universal Space
35.      Is universal space infinite or limited?

 for instance – a specific flavor or even the active qualities of other substances. Since
 there is but one primitive element, and since the properties of different bodies are but
 modifications of this one element, it follows that the most innocuous substance has the
 same underlying principle as the most harmful substance. Thus, water is made up of one
 part oxygen and two parts hydrogen but becomes corrosive if the proportion of oxygen
 is doubled. An analogous transformation may be produced through magnetic action
 directed by the human will. – Auth.

                        Part One – Chapter II


      “Infinite. If it had limits, what would be beyond them?
      I know this baffles your reason, yet reason itself tells you
      that it can be no other way. The same is true of the idea of
      the infinite – you will never be able to comprehend it from
      your tiny sphere of thinking.”
        Suppose we were to imagine a limit to space. No matter how far
        out our thought may place it, reason tells us that there must still
        be something beyond it, and so on and so forth to infinity. Even
        if there were only an absolute void beyond that limit, there would
        still be space.

36.   Is there an absolute void in any part of universal space?
      “No, there is no void. What appears to you to be a void
      is actually occupied by matter that cannot be detected by
      your senses or instruments.”

                   The Formation of Worlds
             The universe is comprised of the infinite number of worlds we
             can see and those we cannot see, all animate and inanimate
             beings, all the heavenly bodies moving through space and all the
             fluids23 that fill space.

37.       Was the universe created or has it existed from all eternity
          like God?
          “Obviously, the universe did not create itself, and if it has
          existed from all eternity like God, then it could not be
          God’s work.”
             Reason tells us the universe could not possibly have created itself,
             and since it could not possibly be the work of chance either, it must
             be the work of God.

  gaseous state.” (Gabriel Delanne, O Espiritismo perante a Ciência, pt. 4, chap. 3, Federação

38.   How did God create the universe?
      “To borrow a well-known expression: by the divine will.
      Nothing can better portray that all-powerful will than
      those grand words from Genesis: ‘God said, ‘Let there be
      light, and there was light.’”
39.   Can we know about the way in which worlds are formed?
      “All that we can say and the only thing you can comprehend
      is that worlds are formed by the condensation of the matter
      scattered throughout space.”
40.   In accordance with current beliefs, are comets a
      commencement of the condensation of matter and worlds in
      course of formation?
      “That is correct, but it is absurd to believe in their influence;
      I mean the influence commonly attributed to them, for all
      the celestial bodies play their part in influencing certain
      physical phenomena.”
41.   Could a completely formed world disappear and its compositional
      matter be once again scattered in space?
      “Yes. God renews worlds just as God renews living beings.”
42.   Can we know how long it has taken for worlds to form – the
      earth, for instance?
      “I cannot tell you anything about that, for only the Creator
      knows. Anyone who claimed to have such knowledge or
      to know the ages and ages it took to form them would be
      very foolish indeed.”


       The Formation of Living Beings
43.   When did living beings first appear on the earth?


                                96

                              Creation


      “In the beginning, all was chaos; the elements were all
      jumbled together. Little by little, each thing settled into
      its proper place. Then, living beings appropriate for that
      state of the globe appeared.”
44.   Where did these living beings come from in order to appear on
      the earth?
      “The earth already contained their prototypes, which
      had been waiting for the favorable moment in order
      to develop. The organic elements began to combine
      the moment the force that had kept them apart ceased,
      thereby forming the prototypes of all living beings.
      These prototypes then remained latent and inert – like
      a chrysalis or a seed – until the proper time for each
      species to appear. Then, the beings of each species came
      together and reproduced.”
45.   Where were these organic elements before earth’s formation?
      “They were in a fluidic state (so to speak) in space amongst
      the spirits or on other planets, waiting for the creation of
      the earth in order to commence a new existence on that
      new globe.”
       Chemistry shows us that when the proper conditions are present,
       the molecules of inorganic bodies unite to form crystals of a
       consistent regularity according to each type. However, the slightest
       shift in such conditions is enough to prevent the combining of
       the elements, or at least the orderly arrangement that comprises
       the crystal. Why would the same not apply to organic elements?
       We can store the seeds of plants and animals for many years but
       they do not develop unless given the appropriate temperature
       and environment. We have seen grains of wheat germinate after
       several centuries. Thus, there is a latent life principle in these
       seeds that merely waits for favorable circumstances in order to
       develop. Could this everyday occurrence not have existed since
       the globe’s origin? Is God’s glory diminished by the fact that


                                 97

                        Part One – Chapter III


        living beings were formed out of chaos by the forces of nature?
        Far from it. Instead, this fact corresponds better to the idea that
        God wields divine power over all the infinite worlds by using
        eternal laws. Granted, this theory does not solve the problem of
        how the life elements themselves originated, but God guards the
        divine secrets and has put limits on our inquiries.

46.   Are there still creatures that come into being spontaneously?
      “Yes, but their primitive prototype has always existed in
      the latent state. You witness this phenomenon all the time.
      Don’t human and animal tissues contain a multitude of
      larval prototypes waiting to emerge as soon as the decay
      needed for their existence begins? It is a microscopic world
      that slumbers and then awakens.”
47.   Was the human species among the organic elements on the
      terrestrial globe?
      “Yes, and it came forth at just the right time. This is the
      basis for the statement that humans were formed from the
      dust of the earth.”
48.   Can we know the ages in which humans and other life forms
      first appeared on the earth?
      “No, all of your calculations are purely speculative.”
49.   If the prototype of the human species was among the globe’s
      organic elements, why don’t human beings continue to appear
      spontaneously, as they did when they first came into being?
      “The beginning of things remains one of God’s secrets.
      Nevertheless, we can say that once early humans
      began to spread out over the earth, they absorbed into
      themselves the elements needed for their formation in
      order to pass on these elements according to the laws
      of reproduction. The same happened with all the other
      species of living beings.”

                             Creation


      The Peopling of the Earth: Adam
50.   Did the human species begin with one single man?
      “No, the man known as Adam was neither the first nor the
      only one to populate the earth.”
51.   Can we know when Adam lived?
      “More or less at the time assigned to him – about 4,000
      years B.C.”
       The man whom tradition regards by the name Adam was one of
       those who somewhere survived one of the great cataclysms that
       have modified the earth’s surface in different eras. He became
       the progenitor of one of today’s current races. The laws of nature
       contradict the opinion that the amount of human progress
       accomplished well before the time of Christ took only a few
       centuries, which would have to have been the case if humankind
       had only come into existence at the date assigned to Adam. Some
       regard Adam – and with good reason – as a myth or allegory
       personifying one of the world’s earliest ages.



        The Diversity of Human Races
52.   Where did the physical and moral differences that distinguish
      the earth’s various races come from?
      “From climate, lifestyle and custom. The same would
      happen if two siblings from the same mother were each
      raised differently and far apart: they would show no moral
      resemblance to each other.”
53.   Did humankind first appear at various points on the globe?
      “Yes, but at different periods, which is another cause of
      human race diversity. Later, humankind spread throughout


                                 99

                        Part One – Chapter III


      the different climactic zones and new types arose in the
      course of interbreeding between different races.
      – Do these different races imply distinct species?
      “Certainly not. All are of the same family. Do the different
      varieties of the same fruit mean that they do not all belong
      to the same species?
54.   Since the various human types have not all come from the
      same ancestor, mightn’t they cease to regard one another as
      brothers and sisters?
      “All are brothers and sisters in God because they are
      animated by the same spirit and strive towards the same
      goal. You always want to take words literally.”


              The Plurality of Worlds
55.   Are all the globes spinning through space inhabited?
      “Yes, and contrary to what earthlings believe, they
      themselves are far from being first in intelligence,
      goodness and perfection. Nevertheless, there are
      individuals who think they know the whole truth of the
      matter and imagine that this little planet is the only one
      privileged enough to be inhabited by reasoning beings.
      Pride and vanity! They fancy that God has created the
      universe only for earthlings.”
        God has populated all worlds with living beings all working
        toward the final objective of Providence. To believe that living
        beings are limited only to their own particular spot in the universe
        is to doubt the wisdom of God. However, God has never made
        anything without a purpose and must have intended these worlds
        to fulfill a more important role than simply entertaining our
        eyes. Moreover, there is nothing in the earth’s position, size or


                                  100

                                Creation


        composition that could reasonably support the notion that to the
        exclusion of many thousands of similar worlds it alone is privileged
        with being inhabited.

56.   Is the physical composition of all the different globes the same?
      “No, they do not resemble one another at all.”
57.   Since the physical composition of all the various worlds is
      not the same, do the beings inhabiting them have a different
      physical organization?
      “Of course, just as on yours fish are made for living in the
      water and birds for living in the air.”
58.   Do the worlds farthest from the sun lack light and heat since
      the sun would appear only as a distant star to them?
      “Do you believe that the sun is the only source of light
      and heat? What about electricity? On some worlds,
      electricity plays a role unknown to you, which is much
      more important than the role it plays on earth. Besides, we
      have never said that all beings are made of the same matter
      as you, with organs similar to yours.”
        The existence of beings on the various worlds depends on the
        appropriate environmental conditions in which they are intended
        to live. If we had never seen fish, we would not understand how
        certain beings could live in water. The same applies to other worlds,
        which no doubt contain elements unknown to us. On the earth
        itself, do we not see the long polar nights being illumined by the
        electricity of the aurora borealis? On other worlds, is it not possible
        that electricity is more abundant than on ours and performs a
        general role with effects we cannot comprehend? Hence, it could
        well be that those worlds self-contain the light and heat sources
        required by their inhabitants.

      Biblical Considerations and Account
            ­concerning the Creation

59.    Cultures have held widely differing ideas about creation,
       according to their degree of understanding. With the
       support of science, reason has recognized the improbability
       of some of these theories. However, the one given by the
       Spirits confirms the opinion long acknowledged by more
       enlightened individuals.
       The objection to such a theory is that it seems to contradict
       the sacred texts, but a serious examination will lead to the
       realization that this contradiction is more apparent than
       real and that it results from the way an allegorical meaning
       is interpreted.
       The issue of the first man, personified in Adam, as being
       the exclusive progenitor of humankind, is not the only
       religious belief that has had to be modified. At one time,
       the movement of the earth around the sun appeared so
       contrary to the Scriptures that all kinds of persecutions
       were carried out under such a pretext. Nevertheless, the
       earth continued to move despite the anathemas and no
       one today would dispute it without insulting reason itself.
       The Bible also tells us that the world was created in six
       days and it establishes the time of its creation at about
       4,000 years before the Christian era. Before then, the earth
       did not exist at all – it was created out of nothing. It is a
       solemn text, yet physical science, inexorable science, has
       proven the contrary. Earth’s formation is indelibly written
       in the fossil record, and it has been proven that the six
       days of creation represent successive periods, each lasting
       perhaps many hundreds of thousands of years. This is not

                                102

                      Creation


a theory, a doctrine or an isolated opinion. It is a fact as
solid as is the movement of the earth around the sun, a
fact that theology can no longer refuse to accept, and it
demonstrates the error that one can fall into by attributing
literal truth to often-figurative language. Should we thus
conclude that the Bible is in error? No, rather, people err
in the way they interpret it.
In excavating earth’s archives, science has discovered the
order in which different living beings have appeared on
its surface, and this order is in agreement with the one
indicated in Genesis. The difference, however, is that
instead of having issued miraculously from the hand of
God in only a few hours, the work of creation did indeed
occur according to God’s will, but through the laws of
natural forces over millions of years. But does that make
God any less great and powerful? Is the sublimity of God’s
work lost because it did not appear instantaneously? Of
course not. We would have to have a petty idea about the
Divinity not to recognize the divine omnipotence in the
eternal laws established to govern the world. Far from
diminishing the divine work, science shows it to us under
a more magnificent aspect that better conforms to our
notions of God’s power and majesty precisely because the
work was done without disregard for the laws of nature.
Science places humankind last in the order of the creation
of living beings and is in tandem with the Mosaic record
on this point. However, that record puts the universal
flood at 1,654 years after the earth’s creation, whereas
geology shows us that this great cataclysm occurred before
humankind even appeared. So far, no traces have been found
in the primitive layers that would attest to the presence of
humans or of animals which, from a physical standpoint


                        103

               Part One – Chapter III


at least, would be of the same category. However, nothing
has actually proven this to be impossible. Since many
discoveries have already raised questions about this issue,
it is possible that at any moment the material certainty
of the anteriority of the human race may come to light.
In that case, as well as in others, the Biblical text would
be shown to portray an allegory. The actual issue lies in
determining whether or not the geological cataclysm was
the same one as that of the Noah story. We know that
the time needed to form the fossil layers does not allow
any confusion; therefore, as soon as any vestiges of human
existence prior to the great catastrophe are found, it will
be proven either that Adam was not the first man, or that
his creation has been lost in the night of time. There is no
arguing against fact, and it would have to be accepted in
the same way as the movement of the earth and the six
days of creation.
The existence of the human race prior to the geological
flood is no doubt still hypothetical, but consider the
following: Affirming that humans first appeared upon
the earth 4,000 years B.C., and if all of them except for
a single family were wiped out 1,650 years later, then
the entire current population of the earth must have
originated from the time of Noah, i.e., 2,350 years B.C.
However, when the Hebrews migrated to Egypt in the
eighteenth century B.C., they found a densely populated
and highly civilized land. History also shows that at the
same time India and many other lands were flourishing
as well, and this fact does not take into account the
chronological tables of certain cultures that go back
even farther. Thus, it would have been necessary for
the descendants of a single individual’s family to have
populated, from the twenty-fourth to the eighteenth

                        104

                       Creation


century, i.e. 600 years, all the vast regions that had been
known about at the time (supposing that others had not
been populated). It would also have been necessary for
the human race during this brief period to have evolved
from its primitive state of total ignorance to the highest
degree of intellectual development. Both suppositions
are in contradiction to all anthropological laws.
Human race diversity supports this contradiction. Climate
and customs undoubtedly produce modifications in
physical characteristics, but these modifications can only
be carried so far, and physiological examinations prove the
existence among some races of constitutional differences
more profound than could be produced by climate alone.
The crossing of races produces intermediary types and
tends to erase extreme characteristics. It does not produce
these characteristics, however; it only creates varieties.
Thus, for the crossing of races to have occurred, it would
be necessary for there to have been distinct races in the first
place. But how could there have been distinct races if they
all came from one ancestor and especially in such a short
time? How could anyone believe that in only a few centuries
a few descendants of Noah had been transformed to the
point of producing the Ethiopian race, for example? Such
a metamorphosis would be as unlikely as the theory of a
common origin for wolves and sheep, aphids and elephants
or birds and fish. Once more, nothing can prevail against
the factual evidence. On the other hand, everything can
be explained if we admit that humans existed prior to the
time commonly assigned to their appearance; that their
origins were diverse; that Adam, who lived 6,000 years
ago, populated an uninhabited region; that “Noah’s flood”
was a localized catastrophe rather than the great geological
cataclysm; and finally, that we take into account the

                         105

                Part One – Chapter III


allegorical form characteristic of the Oriental style, which
can be found in all the sacred books of every culture. That
is why it is prudent not to lightly accuse as erroneous those
doctrines which, like so many others, could someday enjoy
a retraction from individuals who currently oppose them.
Rather than being lost, religious ideas become even greater
when they march in step with science. This is the only way
to keep from being vulnerable to skepticism.

           The Vital Principle24
               • Organic and Inorganic Beings • Life and
                   Death • Intelligence and Instinct



              Organic and Inorganic Beings
            Organic beings are those possessing an inner source of activity that
            gives them life. They are born; they grow, reproduce and die. They are
            provided with special organs in order to accomplish the various life
            functions that are appropriate for their needs and their self-preservation.
            They include human beings, animals and plants. Inorganic beings
            possess neither vitality nor their own ability to move. They are formed
            solely by the aggregation of matter: minerals, water, air, etc.

60.       Does one and the same force unite the material elements in
          both organic and inorganic bodies?
          “Yes, the law of attraction, which is the same for all.”
61.       Is there any difference between the matter of organic and
          inorganic bodies?
          “It is always the same matter, but in organic bodies it is
          animalized.”

 		In his comment on sub-question 67, Kardec defines this term as “… the motive force of
24

  organic bodies” – Tr.



                                         107

                        Part One – Chapter IV


62.   What is the cause of the animalization of matter?
      “Its union with the vital principle.”
63.   Does this vital principle reside within some particular agent
      or is it merely a property of organized matter; in other words,
      is it a cause or an effect?
      “It is both. Life is an effect produced by the action of this
      agent upon matter. However, without matter the agent is
      not life, just as matter cannot be alive without the agent. It
      gives life to all beings that absorb and assimilate it.”
64.   We have seen that spirit and matter are two elements
      comprising the universe. Does the vital principle form a third?
      “It is certainly one of the elements required in the
      composition of the universe, but it has its origin in the
      modifications of the one universal matter. You may regard
      it as an element like oxygen or hydrogen, but even these
      are not truly primitive elements, because they both derive
      from one and the same principle.”
      – That would seem to imply that vitality does not result from a
      separate primitive agent, but rather from a special property of the
      universal matter, which has undergone certain modifications.
      “That follows from what we have just stated.”
65.   Does the vital principle reside in any one of the bodies known to us?
      “Its source is in the universal fluid; it is what you call
      the magnetic fluid or the animalized electric fluid – an
      intermediary; the link between spirit and matter.”
66.   Is the vital principle the same for all organic beings?
      “Yes, but it is modified according to each species. It is
      this principle that enables all species to move and act.
      It also distinguishes them from inert matter because the


                                 108

                           The Vital Principle


      movement of matter per se is not life. Matter is moved; it
      does not produce movement by itself.
67.   Is vitality a permanent attribute of the vital agent, or does it
      only develop through the functioning of the organs?
      “It develops only as the body develops. Haven’t we already
      stated that without matter this agent is not life per se? The
      union of the two is necessary to produce life.”
      – Could we say that vitality is in a latent state whenever the
      vital agent is not united with a body?
      “Yes, that is the case.”
        The organs as a whole comprise a sort of mechanism that is driven
        by the inner activity or vital principle residing within them. This
        vital principle is the motive force behind all organic bodies. It gives
        impulse to the organs, whose action reciprocally maintains and
        develops the vital principle – somewhat as friction develops heat.



                       Life and Death
68.   What causes the death of organic beings?
      “Their organs wear out.”
      – Could we compare death to the cessation of movement in a
      machine that has broken down?
      “Yes. If the machine has been badly assembled, it breaks
      down; likewise, if the body becomes diseased, life leaves it.”
69.   Why does a lesion in the heart seem to cause death more often
      than one in any other organ?
      “The heart is a life-producing machine. Nevertheless, it is
      not the only organ in which a lesion causes death; it is only
      one of the body’s essential parts.”


                                   109

                                  Part One – Chapter IV


70.        What happens to the matter and the vital principle of organic
           beings after death?
           “The inert matter decomposes and is used to form other
           beings; the vital principle returns to the vital mass.”
              After the death of the organic being, the elements that had formed
              its body undergo new combinations to form new beings. These
              new beings in turn draw the principle of life and activity from the
              universal source; they absorb and assimilate it, and restore it again
              to that source as soon as they themselves cease to exist.
              The organs are impregnated (so to speak) with the vital fluid25, which
              enables all the body’s components to actively communicate with
              one another when certain lesions occur and to restore functions that
              have temporarily ceased. However, when the elements essential for
              the functioning of the organs are destroyed or profoundly altered,
              the vital fluid cannot transmit this life-giving movement to them,
              and the organism dies.
              A body’s organs necessarily react upon one another to a lesser or
              greater extent, and this reciprocity of action results from their being
              in harmony as a whole. Their functions cease when something
              destroys this harmony, just like what occurs in the movement of
              a mechanism when its essential components break down, or like a
              clock that has been worn out by use or broken by accident, and in
              which there is no longer any motive force to keep it running.
              We have an even better image of life and death in an electronic
              device. Such a device receives electricity and stores it in a latent
              state – as do all bodies in nature. However, the electric phenomenon
              does not manifest until the electric fluid is put in motion by a
              certain cause; only then can we say that the device is alive. When

 		“The ethereal fluid spread throughout the physical body is like a telegraph that transmits
25

  sensation to the sensitive center, which is the spirit. The nerves are the conducting wires
  for this fluid, whose course, however, can be interrupted by an agent that isolates it from
  the brain.” (Marchal, V. The Consoler Spirit, Federação Espírita Brasileira, 1980, p. 284). “The
  vital fluid, also called the vital principle, is a modified form of the universal cosmic fluid. It
  is the basic element of life. Life here is considered in the meaning attributed by science,
  which is characterized by… birth, growth, reproduction and death.” (Gurgel, Luiz Carlos de
  M., O Passe Espírita, Federação Espírita Brasileira, 1994, p. 73 - Both translations ours). – Tr.



                                               110

                                 The Vital Principle


             the cause of the activity ceases, so does the phenomenon: the
             device returns to the state of inertia. Organic bodies may thus
             be compared to batteries or electronic devices in which the vital
             fluid’s activity produces the phenomenon of life; the cessation of
             this activity causes death.
             The amount of vital fluid is not the same in all organic beings. It
             varies according to species and is not constant in the same individual
             or in the various individuals of the same species. There are those
             who are saturated (so to speak) with this fluid, while others possess
             barely enough of it. That is why for some life is more active, more
             energetic and, in a certain way, more superabundant.
             The amount of vital fluid may become depleted and insufficient for
             maintaining life if it is not renewed by absorbing and assimilating
             substances that contain it.
             Finally, the vital fluid may be transmitted from one individual to
             another. Those who have greater quantities of it can give it to those
             who have less, and in certain cases they can bring back a life on the
             verge of being extinguished.



                    Intelligence and Instinct
71.       Is intelligence an attribute of the vital principle?
          “No. Plants are alive but they do not think – they only
          have organic life. Intelligence and matter are independent
          of each other; a body may be alive yet lack intelligence,
          but intelligence can only be expressed through material
          organs. Only the union with spirit endows animalized
          matter with intelligence.”26
             Intelligence is a special faculty possessed by certain classes of organic
             beings, which it endows with thought, the willpower to act and the
             awareness of their own existence and individuality. Additionally, it

  progress – Tr.

        endows them with the means to establish relations with the external
        world and to provide for their own needs.
        We may therefore distinguish the following: first, inanimate
        beings, formed of matter alone, without vitality or intelligence –
        these are the solid bodies of minerals; second, animate, non-
        thinking beings, formed of matter and endowed with vitality but
        not intelligence; third, animate beings, formed of matter, endowed
        with vitality and possessed of an intelligent principle that gives
        them the ability to think.

72.   What is the source of intelligence?
      “We have already said: the universal intelligence.”
      – Could we say that every intelligent being draws and assimilates
      a portion of intelligence from the universal source in the same
      way that it draws and assimilates the principle of material life?
      “That is only an imprecise comparison because intelligence
      is a faculty proper to each being and comprises its mental
      individuality. Besides, you already know that there are
      matters that humans are not allowed to comprehend; this
      is one of them – for now.”
73.   Is instinct something other than intelligence?
      “Not exactly; it is a type of intelligence. Instinct is non-
      reasoning intelligence, through which all beings provide
      for their own needs.”
74.   Can we draw a line between instinct and intelligence; i.e. can
      we determine when one ends and the other begins?
      “No, for they frequently commingle. However, we can
      very well distinguish the actions belonging to instinct
      from those belonging to intelligence.”
75.   Is it correct to say that the instinctive faculties decrease as the
      intellectual faculties increase?


                                 112

                    The Vital Principle


“No, instinct is always present, but humans neglect it.
Instinct can lead us to the good; it almost always guides
us – sometimes more surely than our reason. It never errs.”
– Why isn’t reason always an infallible guide?
“It would be if it were not distorted by pride, selfishness
and faulty education. Instinct does not reason, whereas
reason calls for choice and endows humans with free will.”
 Instinct is a rudimentary intelligence. It differs from intelligence per
 se in that its manifestations are almost always spontaneous, while
 those of intelligence are the result of thought and deliberate action.
 Instinct manifests in various ways according to the different
 species and their needs. In beings with consciousness and the
 perception of external things, it allies itself with intelligence, i.e.,
 with will and freedom.

       The Origin and Nature of Spirits
76.   How may we define spirits?
      “We can say that spirits are the intelligent beings of
      creation. They populate the universe beyond the
      material world.”
77.   Are spirits beings distinct from the Divinity or are they only
      emanations or portions of the Divinity – the reason why they
      are called the children of God?
      “Good gracious! Of course they are God’s work. It is like
      a man who builds a machine, for example; the machine is
      the man’s work but it is not the man himself. You know
      that when individuals make nice and useful things they
      call them their children, their creation. Well then, it is
      the same with God. We are God’s children because we are
      products of the divine work.”


                               117

                        Part Two – Chapter I


78.   Did spirits have a beginning or have they existed from all
      eternity like God?
      “If spirits had no beginning, they would be equal to God;
      on the contrary, they are God’s creation and subject to
      the divine will. God has existed from all eternity – that
      is incontestable – but we know nothing as to when and
      how we spirits were created. You could say that we had
      no beginning if you mean that since God is eternal, then
      God must have always and unceasingly created spirits.
      Nevertheless, when and how each of us was created
      individually, I will repeat: no one knows. It is a mystery.”
79.   Since there are two general elements in the universe, i.e. the
      intelligent element and the material element, could we say
      that spirits are formed from the intelligent element, while
      inert bodies are formed from the material element?
      “Obviously. Spirits are individualizations of the intelligent
      principle, just as bodies are individualizations of the
      material principle. It is the time and manner of this
      formation that we do not know.”
80.   Is the creation of spirits continuous or did it only occur at the
      beginning of time?
      “It is continuous, which means that God has never ceased
      creating them.”
81.   Are spirits formed spontaneously or do they proceed from one
      another?
      “Like all other creatures, God creates them by the divine
      will; but let me repeat once more: their origin is a mystery.”
82.   Is it correct to say that spirits are immaterial?
      “How can we define something when we have no terms
      for comparison, and when we only have an insufficient


                                118

                                       Spirits


         language at our disposal? Can one who is born blind define
         light? ‘Immaterial’ is not the right word; ‘incorporeal’
         would be more precise, because you should understand
         that, since it is a creation, a spirit must be something.
         A spirit is quintessentialized matter27; thus, you have no
         analogies for describing it. It is also so etherealized that
         your senses cannot perceive it.”
            We say that spirits are immaterial because their essence differs from
            everything we label as “matter.” A nation of blind people would not
            have any words for expressing light and its effects. Those who are in fact
            born blind imagine that they perceive everything through their hearing,
            smell, taste and touch, but they would not be able to comprehend
            ideas that came to them through the sense they lack. In the same way,
            we too are “blind” regarding the essence of supra-human beings. We
            cannot define them except by an effort involving our imagination or by
            making comparisons that will always be imperfect.

83.      Do spirits have an end? We can understand that the principle
         from which they emanate is eternal, but what we are asking
         is whether or not their own individuality will come to an
         end and whether or not, like material bodies, at some given
         time in the near or distant future the element from which
         they have been formed will disintegrate and return to the
         mass from which it came. It is difficult to understand how
         something that had a beginning would not also have an end.
         “There are many things that you do not understand
         because your intelligence is limited, but that is no reason
         to reject them. A child does not understand everything
         that its parents understand, nor does an uneducated
         person understand all that a scholar understands. We are
         saying that spirits’ individual existences never come to an
         end – that is all that we can say for now.”

         The Primitive, Normal World
84.   Do spirits comprise a separate world beyond the one we see?
      “Yes, the world of spirits or incorporeal intelligences.”
85.   Which of the two, the spirit world or the corporeal one, is the
      principal one in the order of things?
      “The spirit world; it is preexistent to and will survive
      everything else.”
86.   Could the corporeal world cease to exist, or might it never
      have existed in the first place, without altering the essence of
      the spirit world?
      “Yes, they are independent of each other, yet their
      correlation is unceasing because they continually react
      upon each other.”
87.   Do spirits occupy a specific circumscribed region of space?
      “Spirits are everywhere. They populate infinite space in
      infinite numbers. There are even some who are constantly
      at your side, observing and acting upon you without your
      being aware of it. This is because spirits are one of the
      powers of nature and one of the instruments that God
      uses for fulfilling the providential designs. However, not
      all spirits can go everywhere because there are regions that
      are forbidden to those who are less advanced.


      The Form and Ubiquity of Spirits
88.   Do spirits have a specific, limited and constant form?
      “To your eyes, no; to ours, yes. You might say they resemble
      a flame, a glow or an ethereal spark.”


                               120

                                   Spirits


      – Does this flame or spark have a color?
      “To you, it varies from the color of a dark ruby to a brilliant
      one, depending on the degree of the individual spirit’s purity.”
        Spirit beings are ordinarily represented with a flame or a star on their
        brow; it is an allegory, which alludes to the essential nature of spirits.
        The flame or star is placed there because that is the seat of intelligence.

89.   Do spirits take any amount of time to travel across space?
      “Yes, but they are as fast as thought itself.”
      – Isn’t thought the soul itself moving from one place to another?
      “When the thought is in a place, the soul is there too,
      since it is the soul that does the thinking. Thought is one
      of its attributes.”
90.   Is a spirit who moves from one place to another conscious of
      the distance it travels and the space it crosses, or is it suddenly
      at the place to which it wanted to go?
      “Either way. If it wants to, a spirit can be perfectly aware
      of the distance it crosses, or such distance may seem to
      disappear completely. It all depends on the spirit’s will and
      the degree to which its nature is purified.”
91.   Is matter an obstacle to spirits?
      “No, they can pass through anything: the air, the earth,
      water, and even fire are all equally accessible to them.”
92.   Do spirits have the gift of ubiquity? In other words, can one
      and the same spirit divide itself up or be at various points all
      at the same time?
      “A spirit cannot be divided up; however, each is a center
      radiating in different directions and that is why it appears
      to be in many places all at the same time. Look at the sun.
      The sun is only one body, yet it radiates all around and


                                    121

                          Part Two – Chapter I


      sends its rays to great distances; nevertheless, it does not
      divide itself up.”
      – Do all spirits radiate with the same power?
      “Far from it; it depends on their degree of purity.”
        Each spirit is an indivisible unit, but each one can extend its
        thought in different directions without dividing itself up. We
        should understand the gift of ubiquity attributed to spirits only in
        this sense. A spirit is like a spark which projects its light far off, and
        which can be perceived from all points of the horizon; or like an
        individual who, without changing places or dividing him or herself
        up, can transmit orders, signals, and movement to different points.



                         The Perispirit
93.   Is the spirit per se without a covering, or as some insist, is it
      surrounded by some kind of substance?
      “The spirit is surrounded by a substance that might
      look vaporous to you but which is still quite dense to us.
      Nevertheless, it is sufficiently vaporous to be able to raise
      itself up into the air and travel to wherever it wants to go.”
        As a fruit seed is surrounded by the perisperm, the spirit per se is
        surrounded by an envelope, which, by comparison, may be called
        the perispirit.

94.   Where does a spirit get this semi-material envelope?
      “From each globe’s own universal fluid. That is why the
      perispirit is not the same on all worlds. In passing from
      one world to another, spirits change their envelope just as
      you change your clothes.”
      – Then when spirits from more highly evolved worlds come to
      ours, do they take on a denser perispirit?


                                    122

                                          Spirits


          “They must clothe themselves with your matter, as we
          have already said.”
95.       Does the spirit’s semi-material envelope have a specific form,
          and can it be seen?
          “Yes, a form according to the spirit’s volition, and that is
          how it sometimes appears to you in dreams or in the waking
          state and how it may take on a visible or even tangible form.”


             The Different Orders of Spirits
96.       Are all spirits equal or is there some kind of hierarchy among them?
          “They are of different orders, according to their individual
          degree of self-purification.”
97.       Are there a set number of orders or degrees of purification
          among spirits?
          “The number is unlimited because there is no line of
          demarcation that acts as a barrier between each order;
          thus, the divisions may be multiplied or decreased at will.
          However, if we consider their general characteristics, we
          may reduce them to three principal orders.
          “In the first order we may put those who have already
          reached perfection: the pure spirits. In the second are
          those who have reached the middle of the scale: their main
          concern is the desire to do the good. In the third are those
          who are toward the bottom of the scale: the imperfect
          spirits. These are characterized by ignorance, the desire for
          evil28 and all the passions that delay their advancement.”
 		Throughout this work, “evil” must be interpreted relatively. It does not always imply
28

  absolute depravity or outright wickedness, as symbolized by Satan, for example. Rather,
  there are varying degrees. Question 630 explains it quite simply: “Good is everything that
  is in harmony with God’s law, whereas evil is everything that deviates from it. Thus, doing

                                     Part Two – Chapter I


98.           Do the spirits of the second order only possess the desire to do
              the good29 or do they also have the ability to do it?
              “Their ability depends on their degree of purification: some
              possess scientific knowledge; others, wisdom and goodness.
              All of them, however, have trials that they must yet endure.”
99.           Are all spirits of the third order altogether evil?
              “No, some do neither good nor evil; others, however, take
              pleasure in evil and are pleased when they find an opportunity
              for it. Still others are frivolous or foolish spirits, more
              mischievous than wicked. These take more pleasure in spite
              than evil, and they also take pleasure in amusing themselves
              by vexing people and causing them petty annoyances.”


                            The Spirit Hierarchy
100.          PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. – The classification of
              spirits is based on their degree of development, the qualities
              they have acquired, and the imperfections from which they
              have not yet freed themselves. This classification is by no
              means absolute; no single category displays a well-defined
              characteristic except as a group. The transition is hardly
              noticeable from one degree to the next. The gradations
              blend together at their borders, much like what occurs in
              the kingdoms of nature, in the colors of the rainbow or even
              in the different phases of human life. Thus, we may form
              a larger or smaller number of classes, depending on how
              we consider the subject. Such is the case with all systems
              of scientific classification. Such systems may entail various

     what is good conforms to God’s law, while doing evil infringes upon it.” – Tr.
 		“The good” as a noun: “Excellence or merit; kindness: to do good. Moral righteousness;
29

  virtue: to be a power for good“ (Webster’s, op. cit.). – Tr.

           degrees of completeness, reasonableness or convenience for
           the intellect. Whichever way they are viewed, however, in
           reality they change nothing regarding science itself. In this
           regard, the Spirits30 questioned about this could have given
           various answers as to the number of categories without
           harming the overall idea. There are persons who have
           rather latched on to this seeming contradiction without
           considering the fact that spirits do not give any importance
           to what is purely conventional. For them, the thought is
           everything. To us they leave the form, the choice of terms,
           the classifications – in a word, the systems.
           Furthermore, we would add yet one more consideration that
           we must always bear in mind: among spirits, as among human
           beings, there are some who are very ignorant, and we must
           always be on our guard against the tendency to believe that
           they know everything simply because they are spirits. Every
           attempt at classification demands a methodical analysis and an
           in-depth knowledge of the subject. In addition, just as there are
           ignorant individuals in this world, there are those in the spirit
           world with limited knowledge, who are incapable of learning
           and formulating any kind of system. They only know or
           comprehend any classification imperfectly. To them, all spirits
           who are more highly evolved than themselves are of the first order
           because they cannot discern their differences of knowledge,
           ability and morality – as would be the case with an uneducated
           person among us in relation to learned individuals. Even those
           who may be capable of formulating a system can vary in the
           details according to their own points of view, especially when
           a division has nothing absolute about it. Linnaeus, Jussieu and
           Tournefort each had their own method, but botany did not
           change because of it. They invented neither plants nor their
           characteristics but merely observed analogies, forming groups

and classes accordingly. We have done the same: we invented
neither spirits nor their characteristics; rather, we watched and
observed. We judged by their words and acts, and afterward
we classified them according to their similarities, basing our
classification on the data they themselves had furnished us.
The Spirits generally acknowledge three main categories
or large divisions. In the last category and at the bottom
of the scale are the imperfect spirits, characterized by the
predominance of matter over spirit and an inclination
toward evil. Those of the second are characterized by the
predominance of the spirit nature over matter and their
desire to practice the good: they are the good spirits. And
finally, the first category includes the pure spirits, who
have reached the highest degree of purification.
This division seems perfectly rational and displays well-
defined characteristics, leaving us only to discern, through a
sufficient number of subcategories, the main nuances of each
group as a whole. That is what we did with the help of the
Spirits, whose benevolent instructions have never failed us.
With the aid of the following classifications it will be easy
to determine the order and degree of the highly evolved
or less evolved spirits with whom we may associate, and
consequently, the degree of trust and esteem they deserve.
In some ways, this is the key to Spiritist science because it
alone can explain to us the anomalies that sometimes appear
in communications by enlightening us regarding spirits’
intellectual and moral inequalities. However, we should note
that spirits do not perpetually and exclusively belong to this or
that class. Their progress is gradual, and since it often occurs
in one area more than in another at any given time, they can
display characteristics of several categories, a fact which is easy
to discern through their language and acts.

                               Spirits


             Third Order – Imperfect Spirits

101.   GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS: Predominance of
       matter over spirit; a propensity toward evil; ignorance, pride,
       selfishness, and all the evil passions that result from them.
       They have an intuition of God, but they do not
       comprehend God.
       Not all are essentially evil, however. Some are more frivolous,
       thoughtless and malicious than downright wicked. Some
       do neither good nor evil, but the simple fact that they
       do no good reveals them to be imperfect. However, there
       are others who take pleasure in wickedness per se and are
       gratified when they find an opportunity to practice it.
       Third-order spirits can ally intelligence with wickedness
       or malice, but regardless of their intellectual development,
       their ideas lack elevation and their sentiments are more or
       less contemptible.
       Their knowledge about the things of the spirit world is limited,
       and the little they do know is confused with the ideas and
       prejudices of corporeal life. They cannot give us more than
       faulty and incomplete ideas of that world, but the attentive
       observer may frequently find in their faulty communications
       great truths taught by the highly purified spirits.
       Their character is revealed by their language. Every spirit
       who betrays an evil thought in its communications can be
       placed into the third order; consequently, every evil thought
       that may be suggested to us comes from a spirit of this order.
       They see the happiness of the good spirits, a sight that
       tortures them endlessly because they experience all the
       anguish that envy and jealousy can produce.


                                127

                                Part Two – Chapter I


          They also retain the memory and perception of the sufferings
          of their corporeal life, and this impression is often more
          painful than was the reality itself. Therefore, they indeed
          suffer from the wrongs they themselves endured and from
          those they caused others. And since they suffer from them
          for a very long time, they believe they will continue to suffer
          forever: a belief allowed by God as a punishment.
          We may divide these spirits into five principal classes:
102.      Tenth class. IMPURE SPIRITS. These are inclined toward
          evil and make it the object of all their preoccupations. As
          spirits, they give unscrupulous advice, incite discord and
          distrust, and use all sorts of disguises in order to deceive
          more effectively. They associate with individuals whose
          character is sufficiently weak to make them yield to their
          suggestions and be led into misfortune, and they are
          pleased at being able to retard these individuals’ progress by
          causing them to succumb in the trials they must undergo.
          In their manifestations, these spirits may be recognized
          by their language: trivialness and coarseness of expression
          among spirits, as among humans, is always indicative of
          moral, if not intellectual, inferiority. Their communications
          reveal the baseness of their inclinations, and if they try to
          fool us by speaking sensibly, they are unable to maintain the
          ruse for very long and always end up betraying their origin.
          Certain cultures have transformed them into malevolent
          deities, while others have designated them as demons or
          evil spirits.
          During incarnation, they are inclined toward all the
          vices that are engendered by vile and degrading passions:
          sensuality31, cruelty, deceit, hypocrisy, covetousness and
 		Noun form of the adjective sensual: “Arousing or preoccupied with gratification of the

                                            Spirits


          sordid greed. They do evil for the pure pleasure of it, most
          often without reason. Out of hatred for the good, they
          almost always choose their victims from among honest
          people. They are the true scourges of humanity no matter
          what position they occupy, and no veneer of civility can
          ever cover their dishonor and ignominy.
103.      Ninth class. FRIVOLOUS SPIRITS. These are ignorant,
          mischievous, thoughtless and mocking spirits who meddle in
          everything and respond to every question with no concern
          for what is really true. They love causing petty annoyances
          and little thrills, creating intrigues and misleading people into
          error through deceit and mischief. To this class belong the
          spirits commonly designated by the names of hobgoblins,
          imps, gnomes and pixies. They are under the subjection of
          higher order spirits, who often use them as we use servants.
          In their communications with people, their language is often
          spirited and facetious, but almost always without depth.
          They seize upon human oddities and absurdities, which they
          comment on with sarcasm and satire. If they take distinguished
          names, it is more out of mischievousness than wickedness.
104.      Eighth class. PSEUDO-LEARNED SPIRITS. The knowledge
          of these spirits is quite broad but they think they know more
          than they actually do. Since they have made a certain amount
          of progress in some sense, their language has a serious tone
          about it that can be deceptive as to their true abilities and
          enlightenment. However, such is frequently nothing more
          than a reflection of the prejudices and theoretical ideas they
          held during their earthly life. Their language contains a few
          truths mixed in with the most absurd errors, giving rise to the
          presumption, pride, envy and stubbornness from which they
          have not been able to free themselves.

 senses or appetites; carnal. Lacking in moral restraints” (Webster’s, op. cit.) – Tr.

                       Part Two – Chapter I


105.   Seventh class. NEUTRAL SPIRITS. These are neither
       moral enough to do good nor bad enough to engage in
       wickedness; rather, they vacillate between the two. They
       have not raised themselves above the ordinary human
       condition regarding either their moral qualities or their
       intelligence. They are attached to the things of this world
       and long for its coarse satisfactions.
106.   Sixth class. BOISTEROUS AND DISTURBING
       SPIRITS. Strictly speaking, these spirits do not form
       a distinct class as to their personal qualities and
       they may belong to any of the third order classes.
       They frequently make their presence known through
       perceptible and physical effects, such as raps, the
       movement and abnormal displacement of solid objects,
       the movement of the air, etc. They appear to be more
       attached to matter than the others and they are the
       principal agents of instability in the globe’s elements,
       whether by acting upon the atmosphere, water, fire
       and solid bodies, or in the entrails of the earth. One
       can recognize whenever such phenomena are not due
       to any fortuitous and physical cause because there is
       an intentional and intelligent character about them.
       Although all spirits can produce these phenomena,
       higher order spirits usually leave them to subaltern ones
       since they are more suitable for material rather than
       intelligent matters. Thus, when the higher order spirits
       deem that manifestations of this type are useful, they
       use these spirits as their agents.

              Second Order – Good Spirits

107.   General Characteristics: Predominance of spirit over
       matter; desire to do good. These spirits’ qualities and

                               130

                       Spirits


ability to do good are in proportion to the degree of
advancement they have reached. Some possess scientific
knowledge, while others display wisdom and benevolence;
the more highly evolved ones combine knowledge with
moral qualities. Since they have not yet dematerialized
themselves completely, and depending on their class, they
still preserve stronger or weaker traces of their corporeal
existence and might display some of their former
eccentricities in their language or habits. If it were not for
this, they would be purified spirits.
They comprehend God and the infinite, and they already
enjoy the happiness of the morally upright; in addition,
they feel happy when they do good and hinder evil. The
love that unites them is a source of ineffable happiness that
cannot be affected by envy, remorse or any of the other
evil passions afflicting imperfect spirits. Nevertheless, they
must continue to undergo trials until they reach perfection.
As spirits, they encourage good thoughts in people and
dissuade them from the path of evil. They also watch over
the lives of those who have made themselves worthy and
they neutralize the influence of imperfect spirits on those
who do not yield to them.
When incarnate, they are good and benevolent toward
others; they do good for its own sake and they neither
allow themselves to be led by pride, selfishness or ambition
nor do they display hatred, bitterness, envy or jealousy.
In popular belief, this order includes the spirits called
good spirits, guardian spirits and spirits of benevolence. In
times of ignorance and superstition they were regarded as
beneficent deities.
We may divide this order into four principal groups:

                         131

                        Part Two – Chapter I


108.   Fifth class. BENEVOLENT SPIRITS. Their dominant
       quality is kindness. They take pleasure in serving and
       protecting human beings but their knowledge is limited:
       their progress has occurred more in the moral sense than
       in the intellectual.
109.   Fourth class. LEARNED SPIRITS. These are especially
       distinguished by the extent of their knowledge. They
       are less concerned with moral issues because they have a
       greater aptitude for scientific ones, but they only pursue
       science for its usefulness. These spirits are also free of the
       passions that characterize imperfect spirits.
110.   Third class. WISE SPIRITS. These are characterized by
       moral qualities of the highest degree. Even though they do
       not possess unlimited knowledge, they are endowed with
       an intellectual capacity that enables them to judge people
       and things precisely.
111.   Second class. HIGH ORDER SPIRITS. These combine
       science, wisdom and goodness. Their language only displays
       benevolence and is always noble, elevated and frequently
       sublime. Their lofty status renders them more able than the
       others to impart to us the most correct notions concerning
       the things of the incorporeal world within the limits of the
       knowledge permitted to us. They willingly communicate
       with those who in good faith seek truth, and whose souls
       are sufficiently freed from earthly connections to enable
       such understanding. However, they turn from those who
       are only motivated out of curiosity, or who, through the
       influence of matter, turn from practicing the good.
       When they incarnate on earth under exceptional
       circumstances, they accomplish a mission of progress,
       displaying to us the type of perfection to which humankind
       can aspire in this world.


                                132

                                 Spirits


                  First Order – Pure Spirits
112.   General Characteristics: No influence from matter;
       absolute intellectual and moral superiority in relation to
       the spirits of the other orders.
113.   First and only class. These spirits have ascended through all
       of the degrees of the hierarchy and have freed themselves
       from all the impurities of matter. Having reached the
       highest perfection possible for created beings, they have
       no more trials or expiations to endure. Moreover, because
       they are no longer subject to reincarnation in perishable
       bodies, they live eternally in the bosom of God.
       Since they are no longer subject to the needs or the vicissitudes
       of material life, they enjoy unalterable bliss; nevertheless, such
       bliss is not a monotonous idleness lived in perpetual contemplation.
       They are the messengers and ministers of God, whose orders
       they carry out to maintain universal harmony. They direct
       all the spirits beneath them, help them to perfect themselves
       and assign them their missions. They assist humans in their
       distress and inspire them to do good or to expiate the wrongs
       that keep them from supreme bliss. Sometimes these spirits
       are called angels, archangels or seraphim.
       Humans may communicate with them, but those who
       claim to have them constantly at their orders are very
       presumptuous indeed.


             The Progression of Spirits
114.   Are spirits good or evil by nature, or may they seek to improve
       themselves?
       “They may improve themselves, and as they do so they
       pass from a lower order to a higher one.”


                                  133

                         Part Two – Chapter I


115.   Have some spirits been created good and others evil?
       “God has created all spirits simple and ignorant, i.e.,
       without knowledge. God has given each of them a mission.
       It is aimed at enlightening them and progressively leading
       them toward perfection through knowledge of the truth
       in order to draw them near to God. In that perfection,
       they will find eternal bliss without any troubles. Spirits
       acquire knowledge by experiencing the trials that God
       has imposed on them. Some humbly accept these trials
       and thus arrive more quickly at their destiny, whereas
       others cannot endure them without complaining; thus,
       through their own fault these latter ones remain far from
       the perfection and bliss promised to them.”
       – Then are all spirits at their origin ignorant and inexperienced
       like children, who gradually acquire the knowledge they lack
       by passing through the different phases of human life?
       “Yes, that is an accurate comparison. How much children
       improve depends on their behavior – rebellious children
       remain ignorant and imperfect. However, human life has
       an ending, whereas that of spirits extends to infinity.”
116.   Are there spirits who remain forever in the lower orders?
       “No, all will become perfect. They change, albeit slowly, for
       as we once said, a just and merciful father cannot banish his
       children forever. Do you think that God, who is so great, so
       good and so just, could be worse than you yourselves?”
117.   Does it depend on spirits themselves to hasten their
       advancement toward perfection?
       “Absolutely. The amount of time it takes them depends on
       their desire and submission to God’s will. Doesn’t a well-
       behaved child learn faster than one who is obstinate?”


                                 134

                                  Spirits


118.   Can spirits regress?
       “No. As they progress, they gain an understanding of what
       is holding them back from perfection. When a spirit finishes
       a particular trial, it never forgets the knowledge it acquired.
       A spirit may remain stationary, but it never regresses.”
119.   Could God exempt spirits from the trials that are required of
       them to reach the first order?
       “If they had been created already perfect, they would
       not deserve to enjoy the benefits of that perfection.
       Where would the merit be without the struggle? Besides,
       inequality among them is necessary for their personalities
       to develop, while the missions entrusted to them in the
       various degrees of the hierarchy reside in the designs of
       Providence for ensuring the harmony of the universe.”
         Since it is possible for everyone in societal life to reach the highest
         positions, we might just as easily ask why sovereigns of countries
         do not make generals of every one of their soldiers, why all entry
         level employees are not made supervisors or why all students are
         not professors. There is, however, one distinct difference between
         societal life and spirit life in that the former is limited and does
         not always allow everyone to reach the highest degree, whereas the
         latter is unlimited and assures everyone the possibility of reaching
         the highest position.

120.   Must all spirits pass through the trial of evil to reach the good?
       “Not evil, but ignorance.”
121.   Why have some spirits followed the path of the good, but
       others the path of evil?
       “Don’t they have free will? God does not create any spirits
       evil from the start; they are created simple and ignorant,
       that is, capable of both good and evil. Those who are evil
       have become so through their own will.”


                                    135

                          Part Two – Chapter I


122.   At their origin, how are spirits free to choose between good
       and evil when they are not yet self-aware? Is there some inner
       principle or tendency that leads them more toward one side
       than the other?
       “Free will develops as the spirit acquires self-awareness. There
       would be no actual choice if it were made by a cause extraneous
       to the spirit’s will. The cause is not within the spirit, but outside,
       in the influences to which it yields in virtue of its free will. This
       is the great symbol of the fall of humankind and original sin:
       some yielded to temptation; others resisted it.”
       – Where do the influences that act upon spirits come from?
       “From the imperfect spirits who seek to involve and
       dominate them, and who delight in making them succumb.
       This is what is represented in the allegory of Satan.”
       – Does this influence act on a spirit only when it first comes
       into being?
       “It follows the spirit over the course of its existence until
       it has acquired so much self-control that evil spirits do not
       bother it any longer.”
123.   Why does God allow spirits to follow the path of evil?
       “How do you dare ask God to give account for the divine
       acts? Do you think you can delve into God’s will? Instead,
       you should say that God’s wisdom is found in the freedom
       of choice that has been granted to each spirit so that each
       one may have the merit of its own deeds.”
124.   There are spirits who follow the path of the absolute good
       from the beginning, while others follow the path of absolute
       evil. Aren’t there gradations between these two extremes?
       “Yes, certainly; they are the paths of the vast majority.”



                                   136

                                  Spirits


125.   Will those spirits who follow the path of evil be able to arrive
       at the same degree of elevation as the others?
       “Yes, but the eternities will be much longer for them.”
         We must understand the expression “eternities” to mean the way
         in which imperfect spirits regard the perpetuity of their sufferings,
         whose end they are not allowed to foresee. This belief is renewed
         every time they succumb to a trial.

126.   In God’s sight, are the spirits who reach the highest degree after
       having passed through evil less meritorious than the others?
       “God looks upon those who have gone astray with the
       same regard and loves all of them in the same way. They
       are called evil because they have succumbed; before that,
       they were nothing more than simple spirits.”
127.   Are all spirits created equal with regards to their intellectual
       faculties?
       “They are all created equal, but since they do not know
       where they come from, they must develop their free
       will. They progress in both intelligence and morality at
       different rates.”
         Spirits who follow the path of the good from the beginning are
         not therefore perfect because of it. Although they have no evil
         tendencies, they must still acquire the necessary experience and
         knowledge needed for perfection. We could compare them to
         children who must develop and learn no matter how good their
         natural instincts are – they do not suddenly go from infancy
         to adulthood without a transition. Just as there are individuals
         who are good from childhood and others who are evil, there are
         spirits who are good or evil from the start, but with the crucial
         difference that a child possesses its instincts already formed,
         whereas a spirit is neither evil nor good at its formation. Rather,
         it has both tendencies, taking one direction or the other in virtue
         of its own free will.



                                   137

                           Part Two – Chapter I


                   Angels and Demons
128.   Do the beings we call angels, archangels and seraphim form
       a special category that is different in nature from that of the
       other spirits?
       “No, these are the pure spirits: those at the highest degree
       of the hierarchy and inwardly perfect in every way.”
         The word angel usually rouses the idea of moral perfection; however,
         it is frequently applied to all beings – good or evil – that are beyond
         the human sphere. We say a good angel, a bad angel, an angel of light,
         an angel of darkness. In this case, the term is synonymous with spirit
         and is used here to refer to the good beings.
129.   Have the angels also passed up through all of the degrees?
       “They have passed up through all of them, but as we have
       already said: some accepted their mission without grumbling,
       and thus were able to arrive more quickly; others took a longer
       or shorter amount of time to reach perfection.”
130.   If the opinion holding that there are beings that were created perfect
       and superior to all others from the start is erroneous, how does one
       explain their presence in the traditions of nearly all cultures?
       “You need to understand that your world has not existed
       from all eternity, and that long before it existed there were
       already spirits of the highest degree; hence, people assume
       they have always been perfect.”
131.   Are there demons in the usual sense of the word?
       “If there were demons, they would nevertheless be
       the work of God. But would God be just and good in
       creating unfortunate beings that are eternally turned
       towards evil? If there are demons, they reside on your
       less evolved world and on other similar ones: they are the
       hypocritical men and women who portray a just God as
       an evil and vindictive one. They are those who imagine

                                    138

                                             Spirits


           they can please God by the abominable behaviors they
           commit in the divine name.”
              Only in its modern meaning does the word demon imply the idea
              of evil spirits, because the Greek word daimon, from which it
              derives, means genius or intelligence and applies to all good or evil
              incorporeal beings without distinction.
              According to the common meaning of the word, demons are
              essentially malevolent entities, but like everything else they would
              have to be one of God’s creations. God is supremely just and good,
              and could not have created beings predisposed to evil by their very
              nature and condemned for eternity. On the other hand, if they were
              not one of God’s works, they would be eternal like God, in which
              case there would be many sovereign powers.
              The first condition for every doctrine is that it be logical; therefore,
              in its absolute meaning the doctrine of demons lacks this essential
              point. In the beliefs of less evolved cultures that do not understand
              the attributes of God, it is conceivable that alongside their evil deities
              they also believe in the existence of demons. Nevertheless, for those
              who accept the goodness of God as an attribute par excellence, it
              would negate the divine goodness and be illogical and contradictory
              to suppose that God would have created beings dedicated to evil
              and destined to indulge in it forever.32 Proponents of demons find
              support in the words of Christ, and we will certainly not contest
              the authority of his teachings – we would like to see them more
              in individuals’ hearts than on their lips. But can they be certain
              of the meaning he attributed to the word demon? After all, do we
              not know that the allegorical form is one of the characteristics of
              his language? Should everything contained in the Gospels be taken
              literally? We need no further proof beyond this passage:
              “Immediately after those days of affliction, the sun shall be darkened;
              the moon shall not give its light; the stars shall fall from heaven, and
              the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. Verily I say unto you, this

  view that the demons and Satan were formerly a group of angels of light who subsequently
  rebelIed against God, fell from grace and turned to evil. Here, the author is simply concerned
  with presenting a brief sketch of the Spiritist view of what demons in fact are. – Tr.

generation shall not pass away before all these things are fulfilled.”
Have we not seen the form of the biblical text contradicted by
science where it refers to the creation and movement of the earth?
Could it not be the same regarding certain figurative expressions
employed by Christ, who had to speak according to the time and
region in which he found himself? Christ could not have consciously
made an erroneous statement. Therefore, if in his words there are
things that seem to contradict reason it is either because we have
not understood them or because we have wrongly interpreted them.
Humans have treated demons the same as they have treated angels.
Just as they have believed in the existence of beings perfect from all
eternity, they have also taken the least evolved spirits as beings who
will be evil forever. The word demon should therefore be understood
as referring to impure spirits, who often are no better than the beings
normally designated by that name, but with this difference: their state
is only temporary. They are the imperfect spirits who protest against
their trials, and as a result they will have to endure them for a long
time. Nevertheless, they will finally arrive at perfection after having
made the decision to do so. We might accept the term demon with
this restriction, but because it is generally understood according to its
exclusive meaning nowadays, it could lead to error and give credence
to the belief in the existence of beings created especially for evil.
As for Satan, it is obvious that he is the personification of evil in
allegorical form because it is impossible to believe in a malevolent being
who fights on par against the Divinity, and whose sole concern is to
contravene God’s designs. Since humans need images and figures to
impress their imagination, they have depicted incorporeal beings with
material forms, endowed with attributes that portray their qualities or
defects. Thus, in wishing to personify Time, the ancients pictured it
as an old man with a scythe and an hour-glass. In this case, it would
have been contrary to common sense to portray Time as a youth. The
same was true of the allegories of Fortune, Truth, etc. In modern times,
humans represent the angels or pure spirits as radiant beings with white
wings, symbolizing purity, while they portray Satan with horns, claws
and other bestial attributes, symbolizing the passions. Common folk,
who are prone to take things literally, see real entities in these symbols
just as they formerly regarded Saturn as the allegory of Time.

  The Incarnation of Spirits
       • The Purpose of Incarnation • The Soul • Materialism



              The Purpose of Incarnation
132.     What is the purpose of the incarnation of spirits?
         “God imposes incarnation for the purpose of leading
         spirits to perfection: for some, it is an expiation; for others,
         a mission. However, in order to reach this perfection, they
         must undergo all the vicissitudes of corporeal existence –
         therein lies their expiation. Incarnation has a further
         objective, which is to place spirits in situations where
         they can do their share in the work of creation. On each
         world, they clothe themselves with an instrument that is
         in harmony with the essential matter of that world so that
         they may use that instrument to carry out the orders of
         God. In this way, they contribute to the general work and
         progress at the same time.”
           The action of corporeal beings is necessary for the evolution of
           the universe, but out of divine wisdom God has willed that in this
           same action they might have a means of progressing and drawing
           near to God. Thus, through an admirable law of divine providence,
           everything is connected and everything in nature is in solidarity.


                                    141

                        Part Two – Chapter II


133.   Is incarnation necessary for spirits who have followed the path
       of the good from the beginning?
       “All are created simple and ignorant, gaining instruction
       through the struggles and tribulations of corporeal life. Since
       God is just, God would not make some blissful without
       their having deserved it through hardship and work.”
       – But then what benefit is there for spirits to follow the path
       of the good if it does not exempt them from the hardships of
       corporeal life?
       “They reach the goal more quickly. Moreover, the hardships
       of life are often consequences of a spirit’s imperfections;
       the more purified it becomes, the fewer torments it will
       have to suffer. Spirits who are not envious, jealous, greedy
       or ambitious will not have to endure the torments that
       result from such defects.”


                           The Soul
134.   What is the soul?
       “An incarnate spirit.”
       – What was the soul before its union with a body?
       “A spirit.”
       – Are souls and spirits therefore one and the same thing?
       “Yes, souls are no more than spirits. Before uniting with a
       body, the soul is one of the intelligent beings who populate
       the invisible world, and it later temporarily assumes a
       physical envelope in order to purify and enlighten itself.”
135.   Do human beings possess something else besides a soul and body?
       “The link that unites the soul and the body.”

                                142

                        The Incarnation of Spirits


       – What is the nature of this link?
       “It is semi-material, i.e., half-way between the nature of
       the spirit and that of the body; these two natures need it
       in order to communicate with each other. It is through
       this link that the spirit acts upon matter, and vice-versa.”
         Human beings thus consist of three essential parts:
         1) The body or material being, similar to that of the animals and
         animated by the same vital principle;
         2) The soul or incarnate spirit, which inhabits the body;
         3) The perispirit or intermediary principle, a semi-material substance
         that serves as the primary envelope of the spirit and unites the soul
         with the body. These three together are like a fruit, which consists
         of the seed, the flesh and the rind.

136.   Is the soul independent of the vital principle?
       “The body itself is no more than an envelope, as we have
       repeatedly stated.”
       – Can the body exist without the soul?
       “Yes. Nevertheless, when the body dies, the soul abandons
       it. Previous to birth, there is no decisive union between
       the soul and body. After this union is established, however,
       only the death of the body can cut the bonds between the
       two, enabling the soul to leave. Organic life may animate a
       body that has no soul, but the soul cannot inhabit a body
       that has no organic life.”
       – What would our body be if it did not have a soul?
       “A mass of flesh without intelligence; anything you might
       want to call it except a human being.”
137.   Can the same spirit incarnate into two different bodies at the
       same time?


                                   143

                                    Part Two – Chapter II


             “No. The spirit is indivisible and cannot animate two
             different beings at the same time.” (See the chapters
             on Bi-corporeality and Transfiguration in The Mediums’
             Book)33
138.         What about the opinion of those who regard the soul as being
             the principle of material life?
             “It doesn’t concern us since it is only a matter of words.
             Start by trying to understand each other.”
139.         But certain spirits, and certain philosophers before them, have
             defined the soul as being an animic spark that has emanated
             from the Great Whole. Why the contradiction?
             “There is no contradiction; everything depends on the
             meaning of the words. Why don’t you have one word for
             each thing?”
                The word soul is used to express very different things. Some call
                the soul the principle of life, and in this sense it is correct to state
                figuratively that the soul is an animic spark that has emanated from
                the Great Whole. These last two words refer to the universal source
                of the vital principle, of which each being absorbs a portion, and
                which returns to the Whole after death. This in no way excludes the
                idea of a moral being who is distinct and independent of matter,
                and who preserves its own individuality. This being is also called the
                soul, and according to this meaning one could say that the soul is an
                incarnate spirit. In giving different definitions to the soul, the Spirits
                have spoken according to their usages of the word and according to
                the terrestrial ideas with which they were imbued to various degrees.
                Because human language does not have one term for each idea and
                is therefore inefficient, a large number of misunderstandings and
                arguments have resulted. Hence the reason why the high order
                spirits tell us that we should first of all try to understand each other
                regarding the words we use.34

                        The Incarnation of Spirits


140.   What about the theory that the soul is subdivided into as
       many parts as there are muscles, thus presiding over each of
       the body’s functions?
       “That will also depend on the meaning attributed to the
       word soul. This definition is correct if by it we mean the vital
       fluid, but it is incorrect if we mean the incarnate spirit. We
       have already stated that the spirit is indivisible: it transmits
       movement to the organs through the intermediary fluid
       without dividing itself up.”
       – Nevertheless, there are spirits who have given this definition.
       “Ignorant spirits may take the effect for the cause.”
         The soul acts through the organs, which are animated by the vital
         fluid distributed among them, and it acts more abundantly in those
         organs that comprise the centers or focal points of movement. This
         explanation, however, cannot be applied to the soul as the spirit that
         inhabits the body during life and leaves it at death.

141.   Is there anything correct in the opinion of those who think the
       soul is outside the body and surrounds it?
       “The soul is not enclosed in the body like a caged bird. Rather,
       it radiates and manifests outside of it like a light shining from
       a glass globe or a sound vibrating out from a sonorous center.
       So, in a certain sense it may be said that it is outside the
       body; it is not an envelope of the body, however. The soul has
       two envelopes: the first is light and subtle, which we call the
       perispirit; the other is dense, material and heavy, which is the
       body. The soul is the center of these two envelopes like a nut
       in its shell, as we have already said.”
142.   What about another theory holding that a child’s soul
       continues to complete itself during each stage of life?
       “The spirit is only one: as whole in the child as it is in the
       adult. As instruments of the soul’s manifestation, only the

                                   145

                        Part Two – Chapter II


       bodily organs develop and complete themselves. This is
       one more theory that takes the effect for the cause.”
143.   Why don’t all spirits define the soul in the same way?
       “Not all spirits are equally enlightened regarding these
       matters. There are spirits who are still limited, who do not
       comprehend abstract ideas; they are like the children living
       among you. There are also pseudo-learned spirits who make
       a big show of words in order to assert themselves – another
       similarity to your society. Furthermore, even enlightened
       spirits may express themselves in different terms that have the
       same meaning, especially regarding matters that your language
       is incapable of clarifying; hence the need for the allegories and
       comparisons that you unfortunately take literally.”
144.   Then what is to be understood by the world soul?
       “The world soul is the universal principle of life and
       intelligence from which individualities are born, but
       frequently those who use this expression do not understand
       it. The word soul is so flexible that everyone interprets it
       according to their own imaginings. At times, it has even
       been held that the earth itself has a soul, but by this we
       must understand it to mean the assembly of devoted
       spirits who direct your actions in the right direction when
       you listen to them, and who are, in a way, the lieutenants
       of God on your globe.”
145.   Why have so many ancient and modern philosophers discussed
       psychological science for so long without arriving at the truth?
       “These individuals were the precursors of the eternal
       Spiritist Doctrine and have prepared the way for it. Being
       human and therefore subject to error, they have mistaken
       their own ideas for the light. These same errors, however,
       have served to bring the truth to light through the pros


                                 146

                     The Incarnation of Spirits


       and cons of their doctrines. By the way, a comparative
       study would enable you to understand that in the midst of
       error there is great truth.”
146.   Does the soul have a defined and circumscribed seat within
       the body?
       “No, although it resides more particularly in the head
       among great geniuses and all those who think much, and
       in the heart of those who feel much, who dedicate all their
       actions to humankind.”
       – What should we think about the opinion of those who place
       the soul in some vital center?
       “One could say that the spirit more specially inhabits such
       a part of your organism since all the sensations converge
       on that point; but to place it in what may be considered
       as the center of vitality would be to confuse it with the
       vital fluid or principle. Nevertheless, one could say that
       the seat of the soul may be more particularly found in
       the organs that serve for manifesting the intellectual and
       moral qualities.”


                        Materialism
147.   Why are anatomists, physiologists and, in general, most of
       those who delve into the natural sciences frequently led into
       materialism?
       “Physiologists judge everything by what they see. Because of
       pride, humans imagine they know everything and cannot admit
       that something could possibly be beyond their understanding.
       Their own science thus makes them presumptuous. They
       think nature can hide nothing from them.”


                                147

                         Part Two – Chapter II


148.   Isn’t it odd that materialism is a consequence of studies that
       should, on the contrary, show humankind the superiority of
       the intelligence governing the world? Should we therefore
       conclude that such studies are dangerous?
       “It is not true that materialism is a consequence of such
       studies. Rather, it is people who draw a false conclusion
       from them, for they can abuse even the very best of
       everything. Moreover, nothingness troubles them more
       than they would have you believe, and high-minded
       individuals are almost always more boastful than brave.
       Most of them are materialists because they have nothing
       available to fill the void of the abyss that has opened before
       them. However, throw them a life preserver and they will
       eagerly grab onto it.”
        It is an aberration of the intelligence that leads some to see nothing
        in organic beings but the action of matter as the basis of all our
        actions. They see nothing in the human body except an electrical
        apparatus and they have not studied the mechanism of life except
        in the functioning of the organs. They have seen life extinguished
        many times by a ruptured artery, but they perceive nothing except
        that artery. They have tried to discern whether or not there might
        be something else, but they have found nothing but inert matter.
        Moreover, since they have not seen the soul escape or been able to
        capture it, they have concluded that everything rests in the properties
        of matter, and thus, after death, the mind is reduced to nothingness.
        This would be a sad conclusion if it were true, because then good
        and evil would have no meaning. People would be justified in
        thinking only of themselves and in placing the satisfaction of material
        pleasures above everything else. Social ties would be broken and the
        holiest affections would be destroyed forever. Fortunately, such ideas
        are far from being the rule; one could even say that they are very
        circumspect, composed of nothing more than individual opinions
        and nowhere erected as a doctrine. A society founded on such a basis
        would contain its own seeds of dissolution and its members would
        tear each other to pieces like wild animals.


                                   148

               The Incarnation of Spirits


Humans instinctively hold to the conviction that things do not end
for them once life is over – they abhor the idea of nothingness.
In vain they rebel against the idea of a future life, and when the
supreme moment arrives, there are only a few who do not ask what
will become of them, because the idea of leaving life behind forever
is too painful. Who indeed could indifferently face absolute and
eternal separation from everything that has been loved? Who could
watch without terror the immense abyss of nothingness opening
before them, ready to swallow forever all their faculties and all their
hopes, and at the same time say, “That’s it! After me there’s nothing,
nothing but nothingness; everything is gone without an appeal. A
few days from now and any remembrance of me will be gone from
the memory of those surviving me and there will be no trace of my
passage on the earth. Even the good I have done will be forgotten
by the ingrates I’ve served and there is nothing to compensate me
for this, no prospect except my body being devoured by worms!”
Is there not something horrifying and chilling in this picture?
Religion teaches us that it cannot be like this and reason confirms
it, but a vague and undefined future existence brings nothing to
satisfy our love of the pragmatic. This is what has engendered doubt
in so many. It is correct to believe we have a soul, but what is it?
Does it have any kind of form or appearance? Is it a limited or
undefined being? Some say it is a breath of God; others say it is a
spark, while still others state that it is part of the Great Whole, the
principle of life and intelligence. But what does all this offer us?
What does having a soul matter to us if after death it will be merged
with the immensity like drops of water in the ocean? Is losing our
individuality not the same as nothingness? It is also said that the soul
is immaterial. However, an immaterial object cannot have defined
proportions, and so for us it is the same as nothingness. Religion
also teaches us that we shall be happy or unhappy according to the
good or evil we have done. But what is the happiness that awaits us
in the heart of God? Is it blissfulness, an eternal contemplation with
no other concern than singing praises to the Creator? And are the
flames of hell a reality or only a symbol? The Church itself generally
understands them in the latter sense. What then are the sufferings
of hell? Where is this place of punishment? In short, what do we


                           149

                 Part Two – Chapter II


actually do and what do we actually see in that other world that
waits for each one of us?
It is usually stated that no one has ever returned to give us an
account of what exists “over there”. That, however, is an error,
and Spiritism’s mission is precisely to enlighten us regarding that
future, to enable us to see and touch it to a certain extent, no
longer through reason only but through actual phenomena also.
Thanks to spirit communications, the matter no longer involves
pure conjecture, nor is it solely a probability that each one paints at
will, or something that poets embellish with their fictions or dress
up in allegorical images that seduce us. Instead, it is a reality that
has shown its face to us, in that actual beings from beyond the grave
have come to tell us about their situation there and what they do
there. They have allowed us to watch (so to speak) the events of
their new life, thereby showing us the inevitable fate reserved for
us according to our own merits or wrongs. Is there anything anti-
Christian in this? Quite the contrary, since disbelievers have found
faith as a result and the lukewarm have enjoyed a renewal of zeal
and confidence. Hence, Spiritism is Christianity’s most powerful
aid. If such is the case, it is because God has allowed it. God enables
it to reanimate our wavering hopes and lead us onto the path of the
good through hope for the future.

  The Return from the
Corporeal to the Spirit Life
        • The Soul after Death; Its Individuality. Eternal
       Life • The Separation of the Soul from the Body •
           The Spirit’s State of Confusion after Death



                 The Soul after Death
149.   What does the soul become at death?
       “It becomes a spirit again; i.e. it returns to the world of
       spirits that it had left for a time.”
150.   Does the soul preserve its individuality after death?
       “Yes, it never loses it. What would the soul be if it did not
       preserve its individuality?”
       – How does the soul preserve its individuality if it no longer
       has a material body?
       “It still has a fluid proper to it, which it draws from
       its planet, and which retains the appearance of its last
       incarnation: the perispirit. “



                                151

                          Part Two – Chapter III


       – Doesn’t the soul take anything else from this world?
       “Nothing more than its memories and the desire to go
       to a better world. These memories are full of sweetness
       or bitterness, depending on how the soul has lived its
       earthly life. The purer it is, the more it will comprehend
       the futility of what it has left behind on earth.”
151.   What about the opinion that the soul returns to the universal
       whole after death?
       “Don’t all the spirits taken together make up a whole?
       When you are in a group, you are an integral part of it,
       and yet you still retain your own individuality.”
152.   What evidence is there for the soul’s individuality after death?
       “Don’t you have such evidence through the communications
       you receive? If you were not blind, you would see; if you
       were not deaf, you would hear, because frequently a voice
       speaks to you and reveals to you the existence of a being
       outside yourselves.”
         Those who think the soul returns to the universal whole at death are
         wrong if they mean that it loses its individuality like a drop of water
         falling into the ocean. Nevertheless, they are right if by universal
         whole they mean the entire assemblage of incorporeal beings, of
         which each soul or spirit is a member.
         If souls were melded together into the universal whole, they would
         possess only the qualities of the whole and nothing would distinguish
         them from one another; they would have no intelligence or qualities
         of their own. However, in all their communications with us, they
         have revealed a consciousness of the self and a distinct will. The
         infinite diversity they display under all aspects is evidence of their
         individualization. If there were nothing after death except what is
         called the Great Whole, absorbing all individualities, that whole
         would have to be homogenous, and the communications received
         from the invisible world would therefore all have to be identical. It

            The Return from the Corporeal to the Spirit Life


         is obvious that we are dealing with distinct beings, for we meet good
         and evil, knowledgeable and ignorant, happy and downcast beings
         of all natures: joyful and sad, frivolous and serious, etc. Individuality
         becomes even more obvious when these beings prove their identity
         through unmistakable signs and verifiable personal details related to
         their earthly lives. Furthermore, there can be no doubt about such
         individuality when they manifest as apparitions. The individuality
         of the soul has been taught theoretically as an article of faith, but
         Spiritism makes it obvious, and to a certain extent, material.

153.   In what sense should we understand the eternal life?
       “Only the life of the spirit is eternal; the life of the body
       is transitory and temporary. When the body dies, the soul
       returns to the eternal life.”
       – Wouldn’t it be more correct to understand the eternal life as
       that of the pure spirits, who no longer undergo trials because
       they have finally attained perfection?
       “That indeed represents eternal happiness, but it is all a
       matter of words. You may call things whatever you want
       as long as you understand the words you use.”


 The Separation of the Soul from the Body
154.   Is the separation of the soul from the body a painful process?
       “No. Frequently, the body suffers more during life than
       at the moment of death; the soul itself feels nothing at
       death. The suffering that is sometimes experienced at the
       moment of death is pleasure for the spirit, for it sees that the
       end of its exile is at hand.”
         In a natural death that results from the depletion of organic vitality
         due to age, humans depart from life without even realizing it – like
         a light that goes out for lack of energy.



                                     153

                         Part Two – Chapter III


155.   How does the separation of the soul from the body occur?
       “Once the bonds that held the soul are ruptured, it
       disengages itself.”
       – Does this separation occur instantly and through an abrupt
       transition? Is there a well-defined dividing line between life
       and death?
       “No, the soul liberates itself gradually. It does not escape
       like a captive bird that is suddenly set free. These two
       states touch and blend with each other; this way the spirit
       disengages itself little by little from its bonds: they unravel;
       they do not break.”
         The spirit is connected to the body during life by its semi-material
         envelope or perispirit. Death is the destruction of the body but not
         of the perispiritual envelope, which separates from the body when
         organic life ceases. Observation has shown that at the moment
         of death, the spirit’s departure does not occur suddenly; it occurs
         gradually and may vary in speed according to the individual. For
         some, it is very quick indeed, and in such a case one could say
         that the moment of death is also that of liberation, which actually
         happens soon afterwards. However, for others, especially those
         whose life has been materialistic and sensual, the separation takes
         much longer, sometimes lasting for days, weeks and even months.
         This does not imply that there is any vitality remaining in the
         body or any possibility that it might return to life. It only means
         that an affinity persists between the body and spirit, an affinity
         that always depends on the importance that the spirit has given to
         matter during life. It is logical to believe that the more the spirit
         has identified with matter, the more it will suffer upon separating
         from it. On the other hand, intellectual and moral activity and
         elevated thoughts initiate this separation even during corporeal
         life, and when death finally occurs, the separation is almost
         instantaneous. All this is the result of studies involving individuals
         at the moment of death, and demonstrates that the affinity that
         persists between the soul and the body in some individuals can be


                                   154

            The Return from the Corporeal to the Spirit Life


         extremely painful – the spirit may even experience the horror of
         decomposition. Such a case is exceptional and peculiar to certain
         kinds of death – suicide, for example.

156.   Can the definitive separation between soul and body occur
       before the complete cessation of organic life?
       “Sometimes, in the death throes, the soul has already left
       the body, which has nothing left in it except organic life.
       The individual no longer has any self-awareness, and yet
       a faint breath of life still remains. The body is a machine
       that is kept going by the heart and it continues to live as
       long as the heart circulates blood in the veins, and for that
       it does not need the soul.”
157.   At the moment of death, does the soul sometimes experience a
       yearning or an ecstasy entailing a fore-glimpse of the world it
       is about to reenter?
       “The soul often feels that the bonds holding it to the body
       are loosening, and consequently it employs all its efforts to
       sever them entirely. Already partially released from matter,
       it beholds the future unfolding before it and it enjoys the
       spirit state beforehand.”
158.   Can the example of the caterpillar, which begins by crawling
       on the ground, then shuts itself up in its cocoon in apparent
       death to be reborn into a brilliant existence, provide us an
       idea of terrestrial life, which is followed by the grave and then
       a new existence?
       “A pale idea. The image is good but you must not take it
       literally, as you are always prone to do.”
159.   What sensation does the soul experience at the moment it
       realizes that it is in the spirit world?
       “That depends. If it has done evil for the love of it, the
       spirit is at first ashamed of what it has done. However, it

                                  155

                        Part Two – Chapter III


       experiences something completely different if it has been
       morally upright. It feels relieved of a great weight and does
       not fear the most scrutinizing glance.”
160.   Does a spirit immediately meet those whom it knew on earth,
       and who died before it?
       “Yes, depending on the affection they had for one another.
       They almost always come to receive it as it strives to return
       to the spirit world, and they may even help free it from the
       bonds of matter. It also sees many whom it had lost sight
       of during its sojourn on earth. Additionally, it sees those
       who are in the errant state and goes to visit those who are
       still incarnate.”
161.   In violent or accidental death, when the organs are not yet
       debilitated by age or disease, does the separation of the soul
       and the cessation of life occur simultaneously?
       “Usually so. In any case, however, the instant that separates
       them is very short.”
162.   After being beheaded, for example, does an individual remain
       conscious for a few moments?
       “Frequently, it remains so for a few moments until the
       organic life is extinguished once and for all. However,
       many times the fear of death causes a loss of consciousness
       before the actual moment of execution.”
        This question refers simply to the consciousness that victims may
        have of themselves by means of the body and not as a spirit. If
        they do not lose consciousness before execution, they may preserve
        it for a few very short moments, but they must necessarily lose it
        with the organic life of the brain. This does not mean, however,
        that the perispirit has completely disconnected from the body. On
        the contrary, in all cases of violent death, i.e., when death does not
        result from a gradual extinction of the vital forces, the bonds that



                                  156

           The Return from the Corporeal to the Spirit Life


        join the body to the perispirit are more tenacious and complete
        separation is slower.



 The Spirit’s State of Confusion after Death
163.   Upon leaving the body, is the soul immediately conscious of
       itself?
       “Immediately is not the right word; it remains in a state of
       confusion for some time.”
164.   Do all spirits experience the confusion that follows the
       separation of the soul and body to the same degree and for the
       same amount of time?
       “No, it depends on how evolved they are. Those who are
       already purified are almost immediately self-aware because
       of their detachment from matter during corporeal life.
       However, carnal individuals with impure consciences
       retain the impression of matter much longer.”
165.   Does an understanding of Spiritism have any influence on the
       shorter or longer duration of this confusion?
       “It has a very considerable influence because the spirit
       understood what its situation would be beforehand. The
       practice of good and purity of conscience exerts the most
       influence, however.”
        At the moment of death, everything appears confused at first. The
        soul needs some time to recognize itself; it feels dazed, like someone
        waking out of a deep sleep, who tries to understand the situation. The
        lucidity of its ideas and the memory of its past return as the influence
        of the matter from which it has just freed itself is extinguished and the
        sort of fog that had obscured its thoughts is dissipated.
        The duration of the state of confusion following death varies
        greatly: it may last a few hours, several months or even years. The


                                    157

                  Part Two – Chapter III


ones who experience it for the least amount of time are those who
have identified themselves with their future state during life because
they immediately understand their position.
This confusion presents particular aspects, depending on the
character of the individual and especially depending on the type
of death involved. In violent deaths: suicide, capital punishment,
accident, stroke, mortal wounds, etc., the spirit is surprised and
astonished; it does not believe itself to be dead. It stubbornly persists
in asserting that it has not died. Moreover, it sees its body lying
there and knows who it belongs to, but does not understand that
it is now separate. It seeks out loved ones and speaks to them, but
cannot understand why they cannot hear it. This illusion lasts until
its separation is complete, and only then does it realize its situation
and understand that it is no longer part of the world of the living.
This phenomenon is easy to explain. Surprised by its unforeseen
death, the spirit is stunned by the sudden change that has taken
place. It still believes that death is synonymous with destruction and
annihilation, and since it continues to think, see and hear, it does
not consider itself to be dead. This illusion is strengthened by the
fact that it finds itself in a body similar to the one it just left, and it
has not yet ascertained its ethereal nature. Instead, it presumes that
it is solid and compact like the other, and it is astonished when it
is pointed out that this body is not tangible. It is a phenomenon
similar to that of some inexperienced somnambulists who do not
believe that they are asleep.
They believe that sleep is synonymous with the suspension of the
faculties, and since they can see and think freely, they do not perceive
that they are sleeping. Even in cases where death has not occurred
unexpectedly, some spirits display this peculiarity. However, it
is more generalized among those who had not thought of dying
despite having been ill. This leads to the curious spectacle of spirits
who attend their own funeral as though it were someone else’s, and
who speak of it as though it in no way concerns them – until they
suddenly comprehend the truth.
There is nothing painful about the state of confusion following
death for moral individuals; they are calm and their perceptions are


                            158

   The Return from the Corporeal to the Spirit Life


those of a peaceful awakening. However, for those whose conscience
is not pure, it is full of anxiety and anguish.
In cases of collective death, it has been observed that all those who have
perished at the same time do not always see one another immediately.
In the confusion following death, each spirit goes its own way or
concerns itself only with those in whom it takes an interest.

                      Reincarnation
166.   How can a soul who did not reach perfection during its
       corporeal life complete the work of its purification?
       “By submitting to the trial of a new existence.”
       – How does the soul accomplish this new existence? Through
       its transformation as a spirit?
       “In order to purify itself, the soul of course undergoes a
       transformation, but for this to occur it needs the trial of
       corporeal life.”
       – Then does the soul live many corporeal existences?
       “Yes, we all live many lives and those who say otherwise
       wish to keep you in the ignorance in which they themselves
       dwell. That is their desire.”


                               161

                        Part Two – Chapter IV


       – From this principle, it seems that after having left one
       body behind, the soul then takes another; in other words, it
       reincarnates into a new body. Is this the case?
       “Obviously.”
167.   What is the purpose of reincarnation?
       “Expiation and humankind’s progressive improvement.
       Without reincarnation, how could there be justice?”
168.   Is the number of corporeal lives limited, or does a spirit go on
       reincarnating forever?
       “In each new life, a spirit takes another step on the path of
       progress. When it has stripped itself of all impurities it has
       no further need of the trials of corporeal life.”
169.   Is the number of incarnations generally the same for all spirits?
       “No. Those who advance quickly spare themselves many
       trials. Nevertheless, since progress is almost infinite, a large
       number of incarnations are always required.”
170.   What does the spirit become after its final incarnation?
       “A blessed spirit; a pure spirit.”


           The Justice of Reincarnation
171.   On what is the doctrine of reincarnation based?
       “On the justice of God and revelation. We will repeat
       this to you over and over: a good father always leaves
       the door of repentance open to his children. Doesn’t
       reason tell you that it would be unjust to keep eternal
       bliss from those who have not enjoyed the opportunities
       needed to improve themselves? Aren’t all people God’s
       children? It is only among selfish human beings that

                                 162

                        The Plurality of Existences


       we find iniquity, insatiable hatred, and unforgiving
       punishment.”
         All spirits are en route toward perfection and God furnishes them
         with the means of accomplishing it through the trials of corporeal
         life. Out of divine justice, God permits them to accomplish in new
         existences whatever they could not do or complete in a previous trial.
         It would not be consistent with equity or according to God’s
         goodness to punish forever those who, regardless of their will, had
         encountered obstacles to their improvement within the surroundings
         in which they had been placed. If the fate of all human beings is
         irrevocably sealed after their death, it would mean that God does
         not weigh the actions of all on the same scales and that God does
         not treat everyone impartially.
         The doctrine of reincarnation, which consists in accepting the fact
         that humans have many successive lives, is the only one that is in
         line with the idea of God’s justice concerning those of a lower moral
         condition. It is the only one that can explain our future and give
         us hope because it offers us the means of atoning for our errors
         through new trials. Reason confirms this and it is what the Spirits
         have taught us.
         Those who are aware of how imperfect they are derive a consoling
         hope from the doctrine of reincarnation. If they truly believe in
         the justice of God, they cannot expect to be equal for all eternity
         to those who have done better than they. The thought that such
         imperfection will not exclude them forever from the supreme good,
         and the fact that they will be able to reach it through continued
         effort supports them and renews their courage. Who, at the end of
         one’s career, does not regret having acquired a particular experience
         too late to have profited from it? This lately acquired experience will
         not be lost, however; it will be of benefit in a new existence.



        Incarnation on Different Worlds
172.   Are all of our different corporeal existences lived on earth?

                                    163

                        Part Two – Chapter IV


       “No, not all of them. They may be lived on other worlds as
       well. Those on this globe are neither the first nor the last, but
       they are of the most material and the farthest from perfection.”
173.   With each new corporeal existence does the soul pass from one
       world to another, or does it live several lives on the same globe?
       “It may live many lives on the same world if it has not
       evolved sufficiently to go to a more advanced one.”
       – So we may reappear several times on the earth?
       “Of course.”
       – Can we come back to it again after having lived on other
       worlds?
       “Certainly; you may have already lived on other worlds
       besides earth.”
174.   Is it necessary to live again on the earth?
       “No, but if you do not progress, you may go to another
       world that is no better – perhaps one that is even worse.”
175.   Is there any special advantage in coming back to live on the earth?
       “No special advantage, unless you come on a mission;
       however, in that case, you will progress nonetheless, just
       like you would on any other world.”
       – Wouldn’t it be better to remain a spirit?
       “No, no! That would keep you at a standstill. What you
       want is to evolve toward God.”
176.   After having incarnated on other worlds, can spirits incarnate
       on this one without ever having come here before?
       “Yes, just as you can incarnate on other globes. All worlds
       are in solidarity. What you have not accomplished on one,
       you may on another.”

                                  164

                      The Plurality of Existences


       – Then are there those who are on the earth for the first time?
       “There are many and at various degrees.”
       – Is there some kind of indication by which we may recognize
       a spirit who is on the earth for the first time?
       “That would be of no use to you whatsoever.”
177.   In order to arrive at the perfection and supreme bliss that are
       humankind’s final aim, must a spirit have lived on all the
       worlds in the entire universe?
       “No, because there are many worlds of like degree, where
       the spirit would learn nothing new.”
       – Then how can we explain the plurality of a spirit’s lives on
       the same globe?
       “It may find itself there each time in very different
       situations, which will provide it with many opportunities
       to acquire experience.”
178.   Can spirits be reborn corporeally on a world that is relatively
       less evolved than the one on which they have already lived?
       “Yes, when they have a mission to fulfill that will aid their
       progress. They joyfully accept the tribulations of this kind
       of existence in such a case because they furnish them a
       means for their further advancement.”
       – Mightn’t this also occur as an expiation, and mightn’t God
       send rebellious spirits to less evolved worlds?
       “Spirits may remain at a standstill but they never regress.
       Thus, their punishment consists in not advancing and in
       having to recommence badly-used lives in an environment
       more suited to their nature.”
       – Who are the ones who must recommence the same existence?
       “Those who have failed in their mission or trials.”

                                 165

                                 Part Two – Chapter IV


179.        Are the beings who inhabit each world all at the same degree
            of purification?
            “No, it is like on earth. There are some who are more
            advanced and some who are less advanced.”
180.        In passing from this world to another, does a spirit retain the
            intelligence it possessed here?
            “Yes indeed, because intelligence is never lost. Such a spirit
            may not have the same means of expressing it, however. It
            depends both on its degree of purity and the state of the
            body it acquires.” (See: Influence of the Organism) 35
181.        Do the beings who inhabit different worlds have bodies
            similar to ours?
            “Of course they have bodies because the spirit must be clothed
            with matter in order to act upon matter. This envelope,
            however, is more material or less so, according to the degree
            of purity the spirit has reached. This is what determines the
            differences among the worlds through which we must pass,
            for there are many dwellings in God’s house, and therefore
            many degrees. Some recognize this and are conscious of it
            here on the earth, but others know nothing at all about it.”
182.        Can we accurately know the physical and moral state of
            different worlds?
            “We, the Spirits, can only reply to you according to your
            degree of evolution. This means that we must not reveal
            these things to everybody because not all are in the same
            position to comprehend them; hence, such revelations
            would be troubling to them.”
               As spirits purify themselves, the bodies that clothe them also
               approach the spirit nature. Their matter becomes less dense and

         they no longer painfully drag themselves around on the ground.
         The needs of their physical bodies are less coarse and they no longer
         have to destroy other living beings in order to feed themselves. They
         are freer and have a perception unknown to us, which enables them
         to see things far away; in other words, they can see things through
         the eyes of their body that we can see only through thought.
         The purification of spirits is reflected in the moral perfection of the
         beings in which they are incarnated. The animal passions become
         weaker, and selfishness gives way to a fraternal sentiment. It is thus
         that on worlds more highly evolved than our own, wars are unknown,
         and there are no motives for hatred and discord, because no one
         would dream of harming a fellow being. Their intuition concerning
         the future – which is a surety that a conscience void of remorse gives
         them – makes death no longer a cause for apprehension. Instead,
         they look upon it without fear and as a simple transformation.
         The lifespan on different worlds appears to be proportionate to the
         spirit’s degree of moral and physical advancement, and this is perfectly
         logical. The less material the body is, the less it is subject to the torments
         that disorganize it; the purer the spirit is, the less it is subject to the
         passions that undermine it. This is a further design of Providence, who
         desires for suffering to be shortened as much as possible.

183.   In passing from one world to another, must a spirit experience
       a new childhood?
       “Childhood is a necessary transition on all worlds, but it is
       not always as obtuse as it is on yours.”
184.   Can spirits choose the new world they will inhabit?
       “Not always, but they may ask for and receive what they
       desire if they deserve it, because spirits only have access to
       worlds according to their degree of purification.”
       – If a spirit doesn’t make a request, what determines the world
       on which it will reincarnate?
       “Its degree of purification.”


                                      167

                         Part Two – Chapter IV


185.   Is the physical and moral state of living beings on each globe
       perpetually the same?
       “No. All worlds are subject to the law of progress. All
       began like yours: in an inferior state; however, the
       earth will undergo a transformation. It will become a
       terrestrial paradise when all humankind chooses good
       over evil.”
         Thus, the race that populates the earth today will disappear someday
         and will be replaced gradually by more highly evolved beings. Such
         races will succeed the current one, just as the current one succeeded
         others that were even less evolved.

186.   Are there worlds on which the spirit no longer lives in a
       material body and only has the perispirit as its envelope?
       “Yes, and that envelope itself becomes so etherealized that
       to you it is as if it did not exist at all. This is the state of
       the pure spirits.”
       – So based on this premise, it would seem that there is no
       precise line separating the state of the final incarnations and
       that of a pure spirit?
       “There is no such line. The difference diminishes little
       by little, finally becoming imperceptible – like the night
       fading away at the first light of day.”
187.   Is the perispirit’s substance the same on all globes?
       “No, it is more etherealized on some than on others. When
       it goes from one world to another, a spirit clothes itself
       with the matter proper for each world at a speed faster
       than lightning.”
188.   Do pure spirits inhabit special worlds, or do they inhabit
       universal space without being attached to any particular
       globe?


                                   168

                                  The Plurality of Existences


              “Pure spirits inhabit certain worlds, but they are not
              confined to them as people are to the earth. They are
              much better than all others at being ubiquitous.”36



 		According to some spirits, of all the globes that comprise our solar system, the earth is
36

  one of those whose inhabitants are the least physically and morally advanced. Mars, as a
  planet per se, is even less advanced, whereas Jupiter is far superior in every respect. The
  sun is not inhabited by corporeal beings, but is a meeting place for high order spirits,
  who radiate their thought from there to other worlds, which they govern with the aid
  of low order spirits by communicating with them through the universal fluid. Regarding
  its physical constitution, the sun could be a focus of electricity. It appears that all suns
  operate in the same way.
     Size and distance from the sun has no necessary bearing on the degree of the other
     planets’ development, because it appears that Venus is more evolved than Earth, and
     Saturn less so than Jupiter.
     Many spirits who have animated well-known personalities on earth are said to have
     reincarnated on Jupiter, one of the worlds nearest to perfection. It is surprising that on a
     globe so advanced, persons may be found who might not have been considered so very
     evolved when they lived on the earth. However, this is not so astonishing if we consider
     the possibility that certain spirits who inhabit that planet could have been sent to the
     earth to fulfill missions that did not place them in very prominent positions, at least by
     earthly standards. Second, between their earthly existence and their life on Jupiter they
     may have had intermediate ones in which they evolved further. Third, on that world as on
     this one, there are different degrees of development, and between those degrees, there
     may be as much difference as that separating the primitive from the civilized individual
     on the earth. Thus, the fact that they inhabit Jupiter does not mean they are at the level
     of the most evolved beings, in the same way that all persons are not on the same level as
     scholars at the Institute simply because they happen to live in Paris.
     The conditions of longevity are not everywhere the same as they are on earth; thus,
     an age-based comparison is not possible. A person who had died some years ago was
     evoked [through a medium] and stated that he had reincarnated just six months ago on a
     world whose name he withheld from us. When questioned about his age there, he replied,
     “I cannot calculate it, because we do not count time like you; moreover, our way of life is
     not the same. We develop much more quickly, so much so that it has been only six of your
     months since I came here. But I must say that in regards to intelligence, I am already about
     thirty earth years old.”
     Many similar replies have been given by other spirits, and these statements contain
     nothing implausible. After all, don’t we see animals on the earth that reach full maturity in
     only a few months? Why shouldn’t it be the same with human beings on other spheres?
     On the other hand, notice that the development acquired by a thirty-year old person on
     the earth may be only a type of infancy in comparison with what he or she could reach
     elsewhere. We would have to be very short-sighted to consider ourselves the prototypes
     of creation, and it would be demeaning to the Divinity to believe that nothing else could
     have been created besides us. – Auth.

                         Part Two – Chapter IV


            Progressive Transmigration
189.   From the time it is first formed, does a spirit enjoy the fullness
       of its faculties?
       “No. Like a human being, a spirit has its infancy. When
       they first come into being, spirits have no more than an
       instinctive existence, possessing only the consciousness
       of themselves and their actions. Their intelligence only
       develops little by little.”
190.   What is the state of the soul during its first incarnation?
       “It resembles the state of infancy in corporeal life. Its
       intelligence is only beginning to unfold – it tries its
       hand at life.”
191.   Are the souls of our primitives in a state of spiritual infancy?
       “It is a relative infancy since they are already-developed
       souls endowed with passions.”
       – So do passions indicate development?
       “Development, yes, but not perfection. They are a sign of
       activity and an awareness of the Self. In the very young
       soul, intelligence and life exist only in a seed-like state.”
         The life of spirits as a whole follows the same phases as corporeal
         life. A spirit passes gradually from the embryonic state to that of
         childhood. Over a succession of periods it arrives at the adult state,
         which is that of perfection, but with the difference that there is
         no decline or decrepitude as in corporeal life. Even though its life
         had a beginning, it will have no end, and from our point of view
         it needs an enormous amount of time to pass from spirit infancy
         to complete development. Furthermore, its progress does not all
         occur on one globe only, but on several. The life of the spirit is
         thus comprised of a series of corporeal existences, each providing
         an opportunity for progress in the same way that each corporeal


                                   170

                       The Plurality of Existences


         existence is comprised of a series of days, over which the individual
         acquires greater experience and knowledge. Nevertheless, just as in
         human life there are fruitless days, likewise in the life of a spirit
         there are corporeal existences that yield no improvement because it
         did not know how to live them productively.

192.   Through perfect conduct in this life, can we hurdle all the
       degrees and become pure spirits without having passed through
       the intermediate ones?
       “No, because what humans imagine as perfection is actually
       very far from it; there are qualities they neither know about
       nor comprehend. They may be as perfect as their nature
       permits, but it is not absolute perfection. It is like certain
       children who, no matter how precocious they may be,
       must still pass through youth before arriving at maturity;
       or ailing individuals who must go through convalescence
       before recovering their health. Furthermore, spirits must
       advance in knowledge as well as in morality, and if they have
       progressed in one sense only, they will have to do so in the
       other in order to reach the top of the ladder. Nevertheless,
       the more individuals advance in their present life, the shorter
       and less painful their subsequent trials will be.”
       – Can humans in this life at least assure themselves of a less
       bitter future existence?
       “Yes, of course. They can reduce the length and difficulties
       of the path. Only the negligent remain at a standstill.”
193.   During their new existences, can humans regress to a lower
       level than the one they have already reached?
       “In social position, yes; as a spirit, no.”
194.   During a new incarnation, can the soul of a moral individual
       animate the body of a scoundrel?
       “No, because a spirit cannot regress.”

                                   171

                          Part Two – Chapter IV


       – Can the soul of a wicked individual become the soul of a
       moral one?
       “Yes. If it repents, such would be a reward.”
         The evolution of spirits is progressive and never regressive. They
         raise themselves gradually through the hierarchy and do not descend
         from the level they have reached. In their different corporeal lives,
         they may descend as individuals but not as spirits. Thus, the soul
         of a powerful person may later animate a humble artisan, and
         vice versa, because positions among individuals are frequently the
         inverse of the elevation of their morality. Herod was a king; Jesus
         was a carpenter.

195.   Mightn’t the possibility of improving oneself in another
       existence lead some persons to persevere on the evil path with
       the thought that they can always correct themselves later?
       “Those who think that way do not really believe anything
       at all. The idea of eternal punishment no longer restrains
       them because their reason rejects it; instead, it leads them
       to question everything. If only reasonable means were used
       to guide humans, there would be no such skeptics. During
       its corporeal life, an imperfect spirit may think as you
       have stated, but once released from matter it thinks very
       differently. It soon perceives that it has calculated badly, and
       so to make up for it, it will carry an opposite sentiment into its
       new existence. Progress is accomplished thereby, which is why
       on the earth there are those who are more advanced than
       others. Some have already had the experiences that others
       have yet to go through; the latter acquire such experiences
       little by little. It depends on each individual to hasten his or
       her own progress or to delay it indefinitely.”
         Persons who find themselves in a dreadful situation desire to change it
         as quickly as possible. Those who have convinced themselves that the
         tribulations of this life are the consequence of their own imperfections
         will seek to ensure a new existence that is less painful. This thought


                                    172

                        The Plurality of Existences


         will draw them away from the path of evil much more readily than
         the thought of eternal fire, which they know to be pure nonsense.

196.   Since spirits can only improve by undergoing the sufferings and
       tribulations of corporeal existence, does it follow that material life
       may be seen as a type of sieve or filter through which the beings of
       the spirit world must pass in order to arrive at perfection?
       “Yes, that is right. They improve during such trials by
       avoiding evil and practicing the good. However, it is only
       after many incarnations or successive purifications and
       after a longer or shorter lapse of time that, according to
       their own efforts, they reach the goal meant for them.”
       – Does the body influence the spirit to improve it, or does the
       spirit influence the body?
       “Your spirit is everything. Your body is a garment that
       rots – that is all.”
         We have a material image of the various degrees of the soul’s
         purification in the juice of the vine. It contains the liquor called
         spirits or alcohol, but it is weakened by the large quantity of foreign
         elements that alter its essence. It only reaches absolute purity after
         several distillations, each removing a portion of the impurities.
         The alembic represents the body into which the soul must enter
         to purify itself; the foreign elements are like the perispirit, which is
         more and more purified as the spirit approaches perfection.



       The Fate of Children after Death
197.   Is the spirit of a child who dies very young as advanced as that
       of an adult?
       “Sometimes much more so because the child may have
       had more existences and may have therefore acquired
       more experiences, especially if he or she has progressed.”


                                    173

                          Part Two – Chapter IV


       – Then can the spirit of a child be more evolved than that of
       its parent?
       “That is very frequently the case. Haven’t you yourself
       often witnessed it?”
198.   Does the spirit of a child who dies very young without having
       done any evil belong to the higher degrees?
       “If such a child has done nothing evil, it has also done
       nothing good. God does not relieve such a spirit of the
       trials it must undergo. If it is pure, it is not because it was
       a child, but because it was already advanced.”
199.   Why is life so often cut short in childhood?
         “The length of a child’s life can be, for its spirit, the remainder of a
         former life that had been cut short before its due term. Moreover,
         the death of a child is often a trial or an expiation for the parents.”

       – What becomes of the spirit of a child who dies very young?
       “It begins a new existence.”
         If humans had only one life to live, and if afterwards their fate were
         sealed for all eternity, why would half the human species, who die
         while very young, deserve to enjoy eternal bliss without having lived
         a full life of effort? And by what right would they be exempt from the
         oft-so-painful conditions imposed on the other half? Such an order
         of things could not be in accord with the justice of God. Through
         reincarnation, absolute justice is the same for all. The future belongs
         to all, without exception and without favoritism, and those who
         arrive last will have only themselves to blame. Individuals must have
         the merit of their actions, for which they are justly responsible.
         Moreover, it is unreasonable to consider childhood as a state of
         innocence. Do we not see children endowed with the worst instincts
         at an age at which education could not have yet exerted its influence?
         What about those who seem to be born cunning, deceitful and
         treacherous, who even harbor instincts for thieving and murder,
         in spite of the good examples surrounding them? Criminal law


                                    174

                        The Plurality of Existences


         absolves them when they commit misdeeds by considering them
         to have acted without discernment, driven more by instinct than
         deliberate intent. But where do such instincts come from, which
         differ so widely among children of the same age, reared under the
         same conditions and subject to the same influences? Where does
         such precocious wickedness come from if not from the imperfect
         nature of the spirit, since education has nothing to do with it? Those
         who are really wicked have progressed less and must therefore suffer
         the consequences, not of their acts during their present childhood,
         but of their previous lives. It is thus that the law is the same for all
         and that the justice of God extends to all.



                      Gender in Spirits
200.   Are spirits male and female?
       “Not as you understand it, because sex depends on organic
       composition. Love and sympathy exist among spirits, but
       they are based on the affinity of sentiments.”
201.   Can a spirit who has animated the body of a man animate
       the body of a woman in a new existence, and vice versa?
       “Yes, since the same spirit can animate both male and
       female bodies.”
202.   When we are spirits, do we have a preference as to whether we
       will incarnate into a male or a female body?
       “It matters little to a spirit: it depends on the trials it must
       undergo.”
         Because they are sexless, spirits can incarnate as either men or women.
         Since they must progress in every way, each sex, like each social
         position, offers them special trials, duties and new opportunities to
         acquire experience. The one who always incarnated as a man would
         only know what men know.



                                    175

                         Part Two – Chapter IV


                   Kinships, Affiliation
203.   Do parents transmit a portion of their soul to their children
       or do they give them only animal life, to which a new soul
       afterwards adds the moral life?
       “Only animal life, since the soul is indivisible. Daft parents
       may have intelligent children, and vice versa.”
204.   Since we have had many existences, does kinship go back to
       previous ones?
       “It could not be otherwise. The succession of corporeal
       lives establishes ties among spirits dating back to former
       existences. Such frequently gives rise to the affinity between
       you and some spirits who you might think are strangers.”
205.   According to certain individuals, the doctrine of reincarnation
       appears to destroy family ties by carrying them back to previous lives.
       “Instead of destroying them, it extends them. Since
       kinships may be based on previous affections, the ties
       that unite members of the same family are less precarious.
       Moreover, reincarnation broadens the duties of fraternity
       because your neighbor or your servant may be a spirit who
       was formerly related to you by blood.”
       – It does, however, diminish the importance that some attach
       to their familial affiliation because their father may be a
       spirit who had previously belonged to a different race, or who
       had occupied a much different social position.
       “That is true, but such importance is founded on pride. What
       most people honor in their ancestors are title, class and fortune.
       They would blush if they had had an honest shoemaker for
       a grandfather, but would boast if they had descended from a
       debauchee of noble birth. No matter what people say or do,


                                   176

                              The Plurality of Existences


          they will not prevent things from being what they are, for God
          does not regulate the laws of nature according to their vanity.”
206.      Since there may be no actual affiliation among the spirits of
          a particular family’s descendants, would it be foolish for the
          members to honor their ancestors?
          “Assuredly not, because they should feel happy belonging
          to a family in which more highly evolved spirits have
          incarnated. Although spirits do not proceed from one
          another, they have no less affection for those who are linked
          to them by family ties, for they are often attracted to this
          or that family because of affinities or previous connections.
          You may be very sure that the spirits of your ancestors do
          not feel honored at all with the respect you render them out
          of pride. Their merits do not benefit you except as you strive
          to follow their moral example. Only in that way can your
          memories not only be pleasant but even useful to them.”


                Physical and Moral Likeness
207.      Parents almost always transmit a physical likeness to their
          children. Do they also transmit a moral likeness?
          “No, because their souls or spirits are different. The body
          proceeds from the body but the spirit does not proceed
          from the spirit. There is no other link than blood kinship
          among descendants.”
          – Where does the moral likeness that sometimes exists between
          parents and children come from?
          “They are sympathetic37 spirits, attracted by similarities of
          inclination.”
 		Sympathetic: “In harmony with one’s tastes, mood, or disposition; congenial: a sympathetic
37

   companion” (Webster’s, op .cit.) – Tr.



                                            177

                       Part Two – Chapter IV


208.   Don’t the spirits of the parents exert an influence on their
       children after birth?
       “A very great influence because, as we have already said,
       spirits should aid in one another’s progress. As it is, the
       spirits of the parents have the mission of developing their
       children through education. This is a task for them – if
       they fail to perform it, they will be guilty.”
209.   Why is it that good and virtuous parents sometimes have
       wicked children? In other words, why don’t the good qualities
       of the parents always, out of affinity, attract good spirits as
       their children?
       “Wicked spirits may ask for good parents in the hope that
       their counsels will guide them along a better path. God
       often grants their wish.”
210.   Through their thoughts and prayers, can parents attract a
       good spirit instead of an imperfect one to indwell the body of
       their child?
       “No. They can, however, improve the spirit of the child
       to whom they have given birth, and whom has been
       entrusted to them – it is their duty. Ill-natured children
       are a trial for their parents.”
211.   Where does the likeness of character come from, which so often
       exists among siblings, especially between twins?
       “They are sympathetic spirits who are attracted by similar
       sentiments, and who are happy to be together.”
212.   In children whose bodies were born joined, and who have
       some of their organs in common, are there two spirits, that is,
       two souls?
       “Yes, but their resemblance often makes them seem to you
       as though there is only one.”

                             The Plurality of Existences


213.      But if spirits incarnate as twins out of sympathy38, where
          does the aversion come from that may sometimes be noted
          between them?
          “It is not a rule that twins must be sympathetic spirits. Evil
          spirits may desire to struggle together on the stage of life.”
214.      What are we to think of the stories of children fighting in their
          mother’s womb?
          “A figure of speech! In order to portray their hatred as
          ingrained, it is figuratively set before birth. Humans
          usually do not make sufficient allowance for images that
          are intended to be merely poetic.”
215.      Where does the distinctive character that we observe in each
          culture come from?
          “Like humans, spirits also form families through similarities
          in tendencies. The purity of such tendencies depends on
          how evolved the spirits are. Additionally, cultures are large
          families where sympathetic spirits congregate, and the
          tendency that leads members of these families to congregate
          is the source of the individual likenesses that exist within
          the distinctive character of each culture. Do you think
          that good and humane spirits would seek to live among
          unrefined and cruel people? No. Spirits are attracted to like­
          minded cultures, just as they are attracted to like-minded
          individuals. They look for their own group.”
216.      In their new lives, do individuals retain any traces of their
          moral character from former ones?
          “Yes, that can happen. However, as spirits evolve, they
          change, and their social position may change as well. If

  tastes or opinion, or of congenial dispositions” (ibid.) – Tr.

       a master becomes a slave, his tastes will be very different
       and it will be difficult for you to recognize him. Since
       a spirit is the same spirit in its various incarnations, its
       manifestations can have certain likenesses from one to
       the next. However, these will be modified through the
       customs of its new position until a notable improvement
       has completely changed its character. For example, the
       one who was proud and cruel can become humble and
       humane if it has repented.”
217.   During their different incarnations, do individuals retain
       any vestiges of their physical character from previous lives?
       “The body is destroyed and the new one has no connection
       with the old. Nevertheless, the spirit is reflected in the
       body. Although the body is only matter, it is molded
       by the spirit’s qualities, which impress it with a certain
       character that is mainly visible in the face. For this
       reason, the eyes have been rightly described as the mirror
       of the soul, which means that the face most particularly
       reflects the soul. Thus, it may be that individuals who
       are extremely unattractive physically can nevertheless
       project something pleasant if they are good, mindful
       and humane spirits. On the other hand, there are very
       attractive faces that awaken nothing in you – you might
       even find them repulsive. How can you believe that only
       perfect bodies house high order spirits, when every day
       you encounter moral individuals with deformed bodies?
       Although there may be no pronounced physical likeness,
       a similarity of tastes and tendencies can still pass on what
       we call an air of familiarity.”
        The body that clothes a soul in a new incarnation does not necessarily
        have any relation to the previous one, since it can proceed from
        a very different origin. It would therefore be absurd to conclude



                                  180

                      The Plurality of Existences


        that a succession of lives is connected by a likeness that is strictly
        fortuitous. Nevertheless, a spirit’s qualities almost always modify
        the organs that serve for its manifestation, impressing a distinctive
        stamp on the face, and even on the general manner. Thus, inside
        the humblest envelope one might find expressions of greatness and
        nobility of spirit, while under the garment of a wealthy person one
        can often find vulgarity and dishonor. Some persons, who have risen
        from the lowest positions, acquire the habits and manners of high
        society with hardly any effort – they seem to have returned to their
        rightful element. But others, in spite of their birth and education,
        always feel out of place there. How can this fact be explained except
        as a reflection of what the spirit was in former lives?



                         Innate Ideas
218.   Does an incarnate spirit preserve any trace of the perceptions
       it had and the knowledge it acquired in its previous lives?
       “A vague memory remains, giving the incarnate spirit what
       you call innate ideas.”
       – Then the theory of innate ideas is not just a myth?
       “No, because the knowledge acquired in each existence is
       not lost. When a spirit is free of matter, it always recalls
       such knowledge. While incarnate, it may forget it partially
       and temporarily, but the intuition that remains helps it
       advance. Without it, it would always have to start over.
       Instead, with each new existence the spirit starts from the
       point at which it had finished the preceding one.”
       – Then isn’t there a very close connection between two
       successive existences?
       “Not always as close as you might think, because the
       conditions of the two lives are often very different; also,
       the spirit may have progressed in the interval between

                                  181

                         Part Two – Chapter IV


       them.” (See no. 2l6)
219.   What is the origin of the extraordinary abilities of those
       individuals who, without any previous learning, seem to
       have an intuition about certain areas of knowledge such as
       languages, mathematics, etc.?
       “A memory of the past and the soul’s previous progress,
       of which it now has no awareness. Where else could such
       abilities have come from? Bodies change, but the spirit
       does not – it merely changes its garment.”
220.   In changing bodies, can spirits lose certain intellectual faculties;
       for example, could they cease to have a taste for the arts?
       “Yes, if they dishonored that faculty or made a bad use of it.
       Moreover, a faculty may remain dormant throughout an entire
       existence because the spirit wishes to exercise an unrelated one.
       In that case, it remains latent but reappears later.”
221.   Are the instinctive sentiment of the existence of God and the
       presentiment of the future life due to a retrospective memory
       that humans have even in the primitive state?
       “They are a memory they have retained of what they knew
       as spirits before incarnating, but pride often stifles this
       sentiment.”
       – Is it the same memory to which are owed certain beliefs related
       to the Spiritist Doctrine and which are found in all cultures?
       “This doctrine is as old as the world. That is why we find
       it everywhere – proof that it is true. Since it preserves an
       intuition of its spirit state, the incarnate spirit possesses
       an instinctive awareness of the invisible world. This
       awareness, however, is frequently distorted by prejudices,
       as well as by superstitions arising from ignorance.”

     Considerations concerning
     the Plurality of Existences
222.      Some persons have stated that the doctrine of reincarnation
          is not new, that it was taken from Pythagoras. We have never
          said that the Spiritist Doctrine is a modern invention. Since
          it stems from the very laws of nature, Spiritism per se must
          obviously have existed since the beginning of time, and we
          have always sought to show that traces of it may be found
          in remotest antiquity. It is well known that Pythagoras
          was not the creator of the theory of metempsychosis39;
          he took it from the Hindu philosophers and Egyptians,
          who had believed in it from time immemorial. The idea
          of the transmigration of souls was therefore a common
          belief, accepted by the most eminent individuals. By what
          road did this idea come to them? Was it by revelation or
          intuition? We do not know. Whatever the case may be,
          an idea could not have traversed the ages and have been
          accepted by the most advanced minds if there were not
          something to it. The ancientness of this doctrine should
          therefore be, if anything, a proof in its favor rather than
          an objection against it. However, it is equally known

 		“[Theory] through which the spirits who did not behave properly and nobly on earth
39

  must reincarnate as lower order animals” (Franco, Divaldo P. Estudos Espíritas, through the
  Spirit, Joanna de Ângelis, 5th ed. FEB. 1991 – translation ours) – Tr.



                                            183

                 Part Two – Chapter V


that between the metempsychosis of the ancients and the
modern doctrine of reincarnation there is this one main
difference: the Spirits absolutely reject the transmigration
of human souls into animals, and vice versa.
In teaching the doctrine of the plurality of corporeal existences,
the Spirits have thus renewed a doctrine that was born during
the earliest ages of the world, and which has been preserved up
to our time in the inmost thought of many persons. However,
the Spirits have presented it from a more rational point of view,
more according to the progressive laws of nature, and more
in harmony with the wisdom of the Creator by divesting it
of all the accouterments of superstition. A point worth
noting is that it is not only in this book that they have
taught it recently: even before it was published, numerous
communications of the same nature had been received in
many regions, and they have multiplied considerably since
then. Moreover, it might be pertinent to examine why it is
that not all the Spirits seem to be in agreement regarding
this doctrine; we shall revisit that issue later.
But for now let us examine the issue at hand from another
angle, apart from any revelations by the Spirits. We shall
put them aside for the moment and assume that this theory
did not come from them at all. Let us even assume that we
have never even pondered it together with the Spirits. Let
us instead place ourselves in a neutral position for the time
being and accept the same degree of likelihood of truth for
both the hypothesis of the plurality of corporeal existences
and that of a single existence, and let us see towards which
side reason and our own interests will take us.
Some individuals reject the idea of reincarnation for the
simple reason that it is inconvenient to them. They declare
that one existence is quite enough, and that they have no


                          184

   Considerations concerning the Plurality of Existences


desire to recommence a similar one. We even know persons
who become infuriated at the simple thought of returning to
the earth. We would ask them whether God ought to ask for
their advice and consult their wishes in setting the universe in
order! One of two possibilities applies: either reincarnation is
a fact, or it is not. If it is, it is useless for these individuals to
oppose it; they will have to undergo it without God asking for
their permission. Opposing it would be the same as a sick man
saying, “I’ve already suffered too much today; I don’t want to
suffer anymore tomorrow.” No matter how unwilling he may
be, he will not suffer any less tomorrow or in the days that
follow until he is cured. Likewise, if those individuals must
live again corporeally, they will do so; they will reincarnate.
They will protest in vain like a child who does not want to
go to school, or a criminal condemned to prison, because
they will have to reincarnate nevertheless. Objections of this
type are too childish to deserve a more serious examination.
However, in order to reassure such persons, we will state that
the Spiritist doctrine of reincarnation is not as terrible as
they might think, and that if they were to study it in depth,
they would realize they have nothing to fear. They would
understand that each new existence depends on themselves;
that it will be happy or unhappy according to what they are
doing in their present one; that from this life onwards, if they
improve themselves to a certain degree, they will never have to
fear falling back into the swamp.
We will presume that we are addressing persons who believe
in some kind of future after death, rather than those who
believe that only nothingness awaits them, or those who
wish to immerse their soul into the universal whole without
preserving their individuality, like drops of rain falling into
the ocean. If you believe in any kind of future at all, you
certainly do not suppose that it will be the same for all,

                            185

                 Part Two – Chapter V


because that would imply that doing good during one’s life
would not matter in the end. In other words, why restrain
ourselves; why not satisfy all our passions, all our desires –
even at the expense of others – if our future will be neither
better nor worse for it? If, on the other hand, you believe
that the future will be happier or less happy according to
what one does in life, would you not desire to make it as
happy as possible because it will have implications for all
eternity? Do you, by any chance, fancy yourself as being one
of the most perfect creatures who has ever walked the earth
and thus have an immediate right to the bliss of the elect? I
would not think so. Thus, without your having to consider
yourself among the reprobate, you must admit that there
are those who deserve more than you do, and who have a
right to a better situation. Well then, mentally place yourself
for a moment in that middle position, which (as you admit)
you occupy at the moment, and imagine that someone says
to you, “You suffer; you are not as happy as you could be,
whereas there are others all around you who seem to enjoy
perfect happiness. Would you like to trade your situation for
theirs?” “Of course, I would!” you reply, “But what do I have
to do?” “Almost nothing. Simply start over what you have
done badly and try to do it better.” Would you hesitate to
accept this proposition, even if it cost you many lifetimes of
trial? Let us make a more prosaic comparison. Suppose you
were to say to a man who, although not in extreme poverty,
is going through hard times due to his precarious resources,
“There is a huge fortune for you to enjoy; however, you
must work hard for it for exactly one minute.” If he were
the laziest being on earth, he would not hesitate to say, “I’m
willing to work for one minute, two minutes, an hour, a
whole day if necessary! What difference would that make if
my life will end up in abundance?” Well then, what is the


                         186

  Considerations concerning the Plurality of Existences


duration of one corporeal life when compared to eternity?
Less than a minute; less than a second.
We sometimes hear this sort of reasoning: God, who is
supremely good, would not impose on us the obligation to
recommence another series of misfortunes and tribulations.
Do they by any chance believe that God would show more
kindness in condemning people to eternal suffering because
of a few moments of error than in granting them the means
to repair their wrongs? Two manufacturers each had a
worker who aspired to partnership, but on one particular
workday, both workers were unproductive and deserved to
be fired. One of the manufacturers actually fired his worker
despite his pleas, and since he was unable to obtain any
other employment, he died in poverty. The other, however,
said to his worker, “You have wasted a whole day so you owe
me compensation. You have performed badly so you owe
me reparation; however, I will let you start over tomorrow.
If you perform well, I will keep you, and you will be able to
continue aspiring to the higher position I promised you.”
Is it necessary to ask which of the two manufacturers was
more humane? Then would God, who is clemency itself, be
more inflexible than a human? There is something poignant
in the thought that our fate is sealed forever because of a few
years of trial, and considering the fact that all our efforts
are insufficient for reaching perfection while on earth,
the opposite idea is eminently consoling since it does not
deprive us of hope. Therefore, without deciding either for
or against the plurality of existences, and without favoring
one hypothesis over the other, we will simply state that if
the choice could be made, no one would prefer a sentence
that could not be appealed. A philosopher once said that if
God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent one for
the contentment of humankind. The same could be said

                          187

                 Part Two – Chapter V


of the plurality of existences. As we stated previously, God
does not ask for our permission, nor does God consult our
preferences – things either are or they are not. Based on
such considerations, let us see on which side the odds might
lie. Let us consider the matter from another point of view –
still omitting the teaching of the Spirits – and examine the
issue solely as a philosophical endeavor.
If there is no reincarnation, then it is obvious that there can
be only one corporeal existence; thus, if there is only one
corporeal existence, then the soul of each individual must
be created at birth (unless we accept the preexistence of the
soul). However, if that were the case, then we would have to
ask what the soul was before birth and if such a preexistent
state would not comprise an existence of some kind or
other. There is no middle ground: either the soul existed
before the body, or it did not. If it existed, what was its
situation? Did it or did it not possess self-awareness? If it did
not, that would be about the same as saying that it did not
exist at all; however if it did, was its individuality progressive
or stationary? In either case, what was its situation when it
joined the body? According to the common belief, which
assumes that the soul is born at the same time as the body, or
likewise, that before incarnation it possessed only negative
faculties, we must ask the following questions:
1) Why does the soul display aptitudes that are so different
from and independent of the ideas acquired by education?
2) Why do some very young children display an extraordinary
aptitude for a particular area of knowledge, while others are
left in mediocrity throughout their entire lifetime?
3) Why do some children seem to be endowed with inborn
or intuitive ideas that are lacking in others?


                          188

               Considerations concerning the Plurality of Existences


           4) Why do certain children demonstrate precocious
           impulses towards vice or virtue, or innate sentiments of
           dignity or meanness that contrast so strikingly with the
           environment into which they have been born?
           5) Why is it that some individuals, regardless of their
           education, are more advanced than others?
           6) Why are there both uncivilized and civilized peoples?
           If we took a Hottentot40 baby at birth, raised it, and then
           sent it to one of our most renowned schools, could we
           make it into a Laplace41 or a Newton42?
           We would ask what philosophy or theosophy43 might
           solve these problems. Either souls are equal at birth or they
           are not – that we cannot doubt. If they are equal, why
           are there such differences of aptitude? One could respond
           that it depends on the physical organism, but in that case,
           we would have a most monstrous and immoral doctrine.
           Human beings would be no more than a machine, the
           whim of matter. They would not be responsible for their
           actions since everything could be attributed to their
           physical imperfections. However, if souls are unequal,
           then it is because God creates them so. Then, we must ask,
           why is inborn mental superiority granted to some and not
           to others? Would such favoritism be consistent with the
           justice and love that God grants to all creatures equally?
           On the other hand, if we admit to a succession of prior and

progressive existences, everything can be explained. At birth,
individuals bring with them the intuition of what they have
already acquired. They are more evolved or less so according
to the number of lives they have lived, or according to how
near or far they are from their starting point. It is exactly like
in a group of individuals of all ages, wherein each one will
have developed according to the number of years he or she
has lived. Successive lives represent for the life of the soul
what years represent for the life of the body. For example, on
the same day, bring together a thousand individuals ranging
from one to eighty years old. Now suppose that some sort of
veil has been mysteriously cast over all their previous days,
so that you unwittingly believe that all of them were born on
the same day. You would naturally ask why some are big and
others are little, some old and others young, some educated
and others still ignorant. Nevertheless, if the cloud hiding
their past were removed, if you were to suddenly realize that
all have lived for a longer or shorter amount of time, then
everything would be explained. God, out of divine justice,
could not have created some souls more advanced and
others less. With the plurality of existences, the inequality
that we see displays nothing contrary to the strictest equity.
There seems to be inequality merely because we see the
present only and not the past. Does this argument rest upon
some theory, some gratuitous supposition? No, because
we start from a patent, incontestable fact: the inequality
of aptitudes, and intellectual and moral development. We
have found that this fact cannot be explained by any current
theory, whereas a new theory gives it a simple, natural and
logical explanation. Would it be rational to prefer the one
that explains nothing to the one that explains everything?
Regarding the sixth question, it will doubtless be stated
that Hottentots are less advanced. But then we will ask:

                          190

  Considerations concerning the Plurality of Existences


are they or are they not human? If they are human, why
would God have denied them the privileges granted to
Caucasians? And if they are not humans, then why try to
make them Christians? The Spiritist Doctrine is much more
encompassing than all of that because it reveals that there
are not several species of human beings but only humans
as a whole. Their spirits are at different stages on the scale
of advancement, but they all are disposed to continually
evolve. Is this not more in harmony with the justice of God?
Heretofore, we have considered the soul according to its
past and its present. However, if we consider it with respect
to its future, we will encounter the same types of problems:
1) If the present life is decisive for our future destiny,
what will be the respective positions in the future life for
those of less advanced cultures and those of more highly
advanced cultures? Will they be on the same level or
divided regarding their eternal bliss?
2) Will those who have worked their entire lives to improve
themselves be on the same level as those who have remained
undeveloped, not due to their own fault but due to either
the lack of time or the ability to improve themselves?
3) Are those who have practiced evil because they were
unable to enlighten themselves liable for a state of affairs
that did not depend on them?
4) Efforts are made to enlighten, moralize and civilize
people, but for every one who becomes enlightened, there
are millions who die every day before the light has managed
to reach them. What is their fate? Will they be treated as
reprobates? If not, what have they done to deserve to be on
the same plane as the others?


                          191

                 Part Two – Chapter V


5) What is the fate of children who die at a very early age
before having done either good or evil? If they are among
the elect, why are they granted such a favor without having
done anything to deserve it? And by what privilege have
they been exempt from the tribulations of a full lifetime?
Is there any doctrine that can solve these issues? However, accept
the existence of successive lives and everything can be explained
in conformity with God’s justice. What we are unable to
accomplish in one existence, we will in another. Thus, no one
escapes the law of progress. All will be rewarded according to
their true individual merit, and none will be excluded from the
supreme bliss to which they aspire, no matter what obstacles
they may have encountered along the way.
Such issues could be multiplied to infinity because the
psychological and moral problems that have no solution
other than the plurality of existences are innumerable –
we have restricted ourselves only to the most general.
Nevertheless, it may still be argued that the doctrine of
reincarnation has not been accepted by the Church. It
would therefore be the subversion of Christianity. It is not
our objective at the moment to address this issue, since
it is sufficient for us to have shown that the doctrine is
eminently moral and rational. Furthermore, what is moral
and rational cannot be contrary to a religion that proclaims
God as goodness and reason par excellence. What would
have become of Christianity if, contrary to universal opinion
and the testimony of science, it had denied the evidence
and expelled whomever did not believe in the movement of
the sun and the six days of creation? What credit would a
religion deserve, and what authority would it have among
enlightened nations if it were based on such obvious errors
that were once articles of faith? Whenever evidence has


                          192

  Considerations concerning the Plurality of Existences


been established, the Church has wisely sided with it. If it is
proven that things exist which would be impossible without
reincarnation, if certain points of Church dogma cannot be
explained except by such means, then it will be necessary
to accept it and realize that the antagonism between this
doctrine and Church dogma is only apparent. Later, we will
show that perhaps the Church is less removed from this
doctrine than it thinks, and that it would suffer no more
in accepting it than it suffered from the discovery of the
movement of the earth around the sun and the geological
periods, which at first also seemed to contradict the sacred
texts. Moreover, the principle of reincarnation appears
in many scripture passages, and is found especially and
explicitly formulated in the Gospels:
“Descending from the mountain (after the transfiguration),
Jesus commanded them, saying, ‘Do not tell anyone what
you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from
among the dead.’ His disciples then questioned him, ‘Then
why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?’ And
Jesus responded, ‘In truth, Elijah is to come first, and will
reestablish all things. But I declare to you that Elijah has
already come, and they did not know him, but made him
suffer everything they wished. It is thus that they will put
to death the Son of Man.’ Then his disciples understood
that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.” (Mt. 17)
If John the Baptist was Elijah, he must have therefore been
the reincarnation of the spirit or soul of Elijah in the body
of John the Baptist.
Whatever may be the opinion that persons have about
reincarnation, whether they accept or reject it, no one will
escape it by merely believing to the contrary. The essential


                          193

                 Part Two – Chapter V


point is that the teaching of the Spirits is eminently
Christian. It rests upon the immortality of the soul, future
punishment and reward, God’s justice, human free will
and the morals of Christ; it is therefore not anti-Christian.
As stated previously, our reasoning up to this point has
excluded all Spiritist teachings, which certain individuals
regard as being without authority. If we, as so many others,
have adopted the doctrine of the plurality of existences, it is
not only because it has come from the Spirits, but because
it has seemed to us to be the most logical and the only one
that resolves issues that until now have been irresolvable.
If it had come to us from a mere mortal, we would have
adopted it just the same, not hesitating to give up our own
former ideas. The moment an error is exposed, our self­-
esteem has more to lose than to gain in sustaining it. In
the same way, we would have rejected reincarnation, even
though it had come from the Spirits, if it had seemed to us
to be contrary to reason, just as we have rejected so many
other doctrines. We know by experience that we must not
blindly accept everything that comes from spirits in the
same way that we cannot accept everything that comes
from human beings. To our minds, its first merit is that
it is eminently logical. But it also has another merit in its
favor, confirmed by the facts, positive facts, material ones,
so to speak, which an attentive and well-reasoned study
may reveal to whomever strives to observe them with
patience and perseverance, and before which doubt is no
longer possible. Once these facts become widely known,
then like the formation and movement of the earth it will
be necessary to yield to the evidence, and its opponents
will have wasted opposing arguments in vain.
In sum, we recognize the fact that the doctrine of the


                         194

              The Plurality of Existences


plurality of existences is the only one that can explain what
would be unexplainable without it, that it is eminently
consoling and conforms to the strictest justice. For
humankind it is the life-preserver that God, out of divine
mercy, has thrown to them.
The words of Jesus himself can leave no doubt about this.
As we read in the 3rd chapter of John’s Gospel:
Verse 3. In replying to Nicodemus, Jesus states: “Truly,
truly, I say to you that if a man is not born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.”
Verse 4. Nicodemus says to him, “How can a man be born
when he is old? Can he enter again into his mother’s womb
and be born a second time?”
Verse 5. Jesus responds, “Truly, truly, I tell you that unless
he is born of water and of spirit, he cannot enter the
kingdom of God. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and
what is born of spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I
have told you, you must be born again.” (See below, The
Resurrection of the Flesh, no. 1010).

223.       Does the soul reincarnate immediately after separation from
           the body?
           “Sometimes it reincarnates immediately, but most often
           after an interval of longer or shorter duration. On more
           highly evolved worlds, reincarnation is almost always
           immediate. Since the corporeal matter of those worlds is
           less coarse, an incarnate spirit enjoys nearly all of its spirit
           faculties. Its normal state is the same as that of your lucid
           somnambulists.”
224.       What becomes of the soul during the intervals between
           incarnations?
 		Or discarnate – Tr.

                         Part Two – Chapter VI


       “It becomes an errant spirit, aspiring to and awaiting a
       new destiny.”
       – How long may such intervals last?
       “From a few hours to thousands of centuries. Strictly
       speaking, there is no outside limit assigned to the errant
       state. It may last for a very long time, but never forever.
       Sooner or later, a spirit always has the opportunity to
       begin another existence, which serves for the purification
       of its previous ones.”
       – Does the length of the interval depend on the spirit’s own
       will, or can it be imposed as an expiation?
       “It is a consequence of its free will. Spirits know full
       well what they are doing in prolonging it, but for some,
       extending it is also a punishment inflicted by God. Others
       ask for it to be extended in order to pursue studies that
       cannot be done productively except in the spirit state.”
225.   Is the errant state in and of itself an indication of spirits who
       are less evolved?
       “No, since there are errant spirits of every degree. Incarnation
       is the state that is transitory, as we have already stated. In
       their normal state, spirits are disengaged from matter.”
226.   Could we say that all spirits who are not incarnate are errant?
       “Those who must reincarnate, yes, but the pure spirits,
       who have reached perfection, are not errant: their state is
       definitive.”
         Regarding their inmost qualities, spirits belong to different orders
         or degrees, through which they pass successively as they purify
         themselves. Regarding their state as spirits, they may be incarnate,
         that is, connected to a body; errant, that is, disconnected from
         the material body while awaiting a new incarnation in order to



                                   198

                             Spirit Life


         improve themselves; or pure, that is, perfected and having no
         further need of incarnation.

227.   How do errant spirits learn, since it can hardly be in the same
       way as for us?
       “They study their past and seek ways to evolve. They watch
       and observe what is going on in the realms through which
       they pass. They listen to the discourse of enlightened
       individuals and the counsels of spirits who are more
       evolved than they are, and this provides them with ideas
       that they do not yet possess.”
228.   Do spirits retain any of the human passions?
       “Upon losing their corporeal envelope, high order spirits
       leave evil passions behind and retain only the ideals of the
       good, but low order ones retain their passions; otherwise,
       they would belong to the first order.”
229.   When they leave the earth behind, why don’t spirits abandon
       their evil passions since they are able to see the trouble they
       can cause?
       “In your world, there are persons who are excessively
       jealous, for instance. Do you believe they will lose that
       defect upon leaving? After they leave the earth, since
       they are not entirely freed from matter – especially those
       who have displayed strong passions – they retain a sort of
       atmosphere around them that is infused with all their evil
       qualities. They only occasionally glimpse the truth so as to
       have the moral path revealed to them.”
230.   Can a spirit progress while in the errant state?
       “It may improve itself a great deal; it always depends on its
       own will and desire. However, it puts its newly-acquired
       ideas into practice only during corporeal life.”


                                199

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


231.   Are errant spirits happy or unhappy?
       “Their degree of happiness or unhappiness depends
       on what they have merited. They either suffer from the
       passions whose essence they have retained, or they are
       happy according to their degree of dematerialization. In
       the errant state, a spirit realizes what it lacks in order to
       be happier; thus, it searches for the means to attain it.
       However, it is not always permitted to reincarnate when it
       wants to. This in itself is a punishment.”
232.   While in the errant state, can spirits visit other worlds?
       “That depends. When the spirit leaves the body, it is still
       not completely disconnected from matter. Hence, it still
       belongs to the world on which it has lived – or to one of the
       same degree – unless it has progressed sufficiently during
       its lifetime. Progression is the purpose to which it must
       hold, for it will never perfect itself unless it progresses.
       Nevertheless, it may go to certain more highly evolved
       worlds, but as an outsider; it can get only glimpses of such
       worlds, and these glimpses are what drive it to improve
       itself so that it may become worthy of the happiness
       enjoyed on them, and to be able to inhabit them later.”
233.   Do spirits who are already purified ever go to less evolved worlds?
       “They frequently do so in order to help such worlds
       progress. Without these spirits, these worlds would be left
       to themselves, without guides to direct them.”


                   Transitional Worlds
234.   As some have stated, are there worlds that serve as layovers
       and resting places for errant spirits?


                                  200

                            Spirit Life


       “Yes, there are worlds that are intended particularly for
       errant beings, worlds that they may temporally inhabit,
       a type of camp site, a place where they can repose during
       a very long errant state, a state that is always somewhat
       wearisome. These are intermediary positions between
       worlds and are gradated according to the nature of the
       spirits who have access to them, and where they will enjoy
       a greater or lesser sense of well-being.”
       – Can the spirits who occupy such worlds leave whenever
       they wish?
       “Yes, spirits who temporarily inhabit those worlds can
       leave them to follow their destiny. Imagine them to be
       like migrating birds that descend on an island in order to
       regain strength before continuing on their way.”
235.   Do spirits progress during their layovers on these transitory
       worlds?
       “Certainly. Those who gather on them do so with the
       purpose of educating themselves in order to more easily
       obtain permission to go to better and better places until
       they reach the position of the elect.”
236.   Due to their special nature, are these transitional worlds
       destined forever to be layovers for errant spirits?
       “No, that function is only temporary.”
       – Are they inhabited by corporeal beings at the same time?
       “No, their surface is barren. Those who inhabit them do
       not need anything.”
       – Is this barrenness permanent, and is it connected to their
       special nature?
       “No, their barrenness is only transitory.”


                               201

                 Part Two – Chapter VI


– Then are these worlds destitute of natural beauties?
“Their nature is expressed in the beauties of their
immensity, and their beauties are no less admirable than
what you call natural ones.”
– Since the state of these worlds is transitory, will the earth be
among them some day?
“It already has been.”
– At what period?
“During its formation.”
  Nothing in nature is useless; each thing has its purpose, its
  destination. There is no empty space. Everything is inhabited
  and life expands itself everywhere. Thus, during the long series
  of ages that elapsed before the appearance of humankind on
  the earth, during the long periods of transition attested to by
  the geological layers, and even before the formation of the first
  organic beings upon that formless mass, there was no absence of
  life in that arid chaos in which the elements were being mixed
  together. Beings who did not have our needs or our physical
  sensations found a refuge there. Even in that imperfect state,
  God willed for it to be useful for something. So, who would
  dare say that among the billions of worlds that spin through
  the immensity of space, only one – one of the smallest – lost in
  the crowd, had the exclusive privilege of being populated? What
  would be the usefulness of all the others? Could God have made
  them merely as entertainment for our eyes? Such is an absurd
  presumption, incompatible with the wisdom that shines in all
  God’s works, and unacceptable if we consider all those that we
  cannot see. No one can deny that, in this notion of worlds which
  are still unsuitable for material life and which are nevertheless
  populated with beings appropriate for the conditions on them,
  there is something grand and sublime, where perhaps we may
  find the solution to more than one problem.

           Perceptions, Sensations, and
               Sufferings of Spirits
237.   Once in the world of spirits, does the soul still have the
       perceptions it had in this life?
       “Yes, and others that it did not have because its body was
       like a veil that obscured them. Intelligence is a natural
       attribute of the spirit, but it is expressed more freely when
       it is unshackled.”
238.   Are the perceptions and understanding of spirits unlimited?
       In other words, do they know everything?
       “The nearer they approach perfection, the more they
       know. If they are high order spirits, they know much. Low
       order spirits are more or less ignorant on all subjects.”
239.   Do spirits comprehend the beginning of things?
       “That too depends on how evolved and purified they are.
       Low order spirits do not know any more than humans.”
240.   Do spirits perceive time as we do?
       “No, and that is what causes you to misunderstand us
       when it comes to setting dates or epochs.”
        Spirits live outside of time as we know it; for them, duration of time
        practically does not exist. The centuries that are so long to us are to
        them only instants that disappear into eternity, in the same way that
        the unevenness of the ground would fade and disappear to someone
        high in space.

241.   Do spirits have a more correct and precise idea of the present
       than we do?
       “More so or less so, like someone who sees clearly has a
       more correct idea of things than a blind person. Spirits see


                                   203

                       Part Two – Chapter VI


       what you do not see, and they judge differently than you;
       but once again, it depends on how evolved they are.”
242.   How do spirits have knowledge about the past? Is such
       knowledge unlimited for them?
       “When we concern ourselves with it, the past is present,
       precisely in the same way you remember something that
       has impressed you during your exile. However, since we are
       no longer hampered by the material veil that clouds your
       minds, we remember things that have disappeared from
       your memory. Spirits, however, do not know everything,
       especially their own creation.”
243.   Do spirits know the future?
       “Again, it depends on how purified they are. Most of the
       time, they may glimpse it, but they do not always have
       permission to reveal it. When they do see it, it appears to
       them to be the present. A spirit sees the future more clearly
       the more it approaches God. After death, the soul sees and
       takes in its past migrations at a glance, but it cannot see
       what God has in store for it. For that, it is necessary for it
       to have become one with God after many lives.”
       – Do spirits who have reached perfection possess complete
       knowledge of the future?
       “Complete is not the right term because God alone is
       sovereign; no one can equal God.”
244.   Do spirits see God?
       “Only high order spirits see and understand God; low
       order spirits feel and intuit God.”
       – When a low order spirit says that a thing is forbidden or
       permitted to it by God, how does it know that the order has
       actually come from God?

                                204

                               Spirit Life


       “It does not see God but senses the divine sovereignty,
       and when something must not be done or when a word
       must not be spoken, it receives a sort of intuition, a secret
       warning, which keeps it from proceeding. Don’t you
       yourselves have presentiments that are like secret warnings
       to do or not to do something? The same happens with us,
       but to a higher degree; you should understand that, since
       the essence of spirits is more subtle than yours, we can
       more easily receive divine warnings.”
       – Is the order transmitted by God directly or through other
       spirits?
       “It does not come from God directly, because to
       communicate with God directly one must deserve it.
       God transmits divine orders through spirits who are more
       evolved in purification and instruction.”
245.   Is spirits’ sight circumscribed as it is in corporeal beings?
       “No, it resides within the entire spirit.”
246.   Do spirits need light in order to see?
       “They see with their own light, without the need for
       outside light. There is no darkness for them, except that in
       which they may find themselves due to expiation.”
247.   Do spirits need to move about in order to see in two
       different places? For instance, can they see what is happening
       simultaneously in two hemispheres of the globe?
       “Since spirits travel at the speed of thought, we can say that
       they see everywhere all at once. Their thought can radiate
       and be directed to many points at the same time, but this
       faculty depends on their purity; the less pure they are, the
       more limited their sight. Only the high order spirits can
       see everything as a whole.”


                                  205

                          Part Two – Chapter VI


         Among spirits, the faculty of sight is inherent to their nature and
         permeates their whole being like light in a luminous object. It is a
         type of universal lucidity extending to everything, simultaneously
         embracing space, time and things, and for which there are no
         darkness or material obstacles. One should understand that it must
         be this way because in human beings sight functions through an
         organ that receives the light; thus, without light they remain in
         darkness. In spirits, however, since the faculty of sight is an inherent
         attribute independent of any outside agent, sight does not depend
         on light. (See: Ubiquity, no. 92)

248.   Do spirits see things as distinctly as we do?
       “More distinctly, for their sight penetrates what yours
       cannot. Nothing obscures it.”
249.   Do spirits perceive sounds?
       “Yes, and they also perceive those that your limited senses
       cannot.”
       – Is the hearing faculty, like that of sight, in their whole being?
       “All perceptions are attributes of the spirit and are part
       of its being. When it is clothed with a material body,
       perceptions only arrive through organic channels. In the
       state of freedom, however, they are no longer localized.”
250.   Since the perceptions are attributes of the spirit itself, can it
       stop using them?
       “A spirit only sees and hears what it wants to; at least this
       is generally the case, especially for more evolved spirits,
       because less evolved ones frequently must hear and see
       what may be useful for their improvement, whether they
       want to or not.”
251.   Are spirits sensitive to music?
         “Do you mean your music? What is that kind of music when
         compared to celestial music, that harmony of which no one on


                                    206

                                Spirit Life


         earth can have an idea? One is to the other what the primitive chant
         is when compared with a soft melody. Nevertheless, ordinary spirits
         may take a certain pleasure in listening to your music because they
         are not yet able to appreciate anything more sublime. For spirits,
         music has infinite charm due to their highly developed sensitive
         qualities. Of course, I am referring to celestial music, which is
         everything the spiritual imagination can conceive of as the most
         beautiful and delicate of all.”

252.   Are spirits sensitive to the beauties of nature?
       “The beauties of nature on different globes are so diverse
       that they are far from knowing about all of them. Yes,
       they are sensitive to them according to their aptitudes for
       appreciating and comprehending them. Evolved spirits
       enjoy the beauties of the whole, before which the beauties
       of detail fade, so to speak.”
253.   Do spirits experience our physical needs and sufferings?
       “They know about them, for they have endured them, but
       they do not experience them physically as you do, because
       they are spirits.”
254.   Do spirits feel fatigue and the need for rest?
       “They cannot feel fatigue as you understand it, and therefore
       they do not need corporeal rest, because they do not possess
       organs in which the energies must be restored. However,
       spirits do rest, meaning they do not remain in a state of
       constant activity. They do not act in a physical way, because
       their action is entirely intellectual and their rest is entirely
       mental. There are moments when their thought decreases
       in activity and is no longer directed toward any object in
       particular. This is a true repose for them, but it cannot be
       compared to that of the body. The kind of fatigue that
       spirits can experience is in proportion to how evolved they
       are; the more purified they are, the less rest they need.”

255.   When a spirit says that it is suffering, what is the nature of
       such suffering?
       “Mental anguish, which tortures it more acutely than
       physical suffering.”
256.   Why do some spirits complain about the cold or heat?
       “It is a remembrance of what they suffered during their
       life, a feeling as painful as the reality itself. Frequently, they
       use these expressions to express their situation. When they
       remember their body, they experience a sensation similar
       to when you take off a heavy coat – immediately afterwards
       you continue to feel its weight on your shoulders.”


  Theoretical Essay on Sensation in Spirits
257.   The body is the instrument of pain; if not its primary cause,
       at least its immediate cause. The soul has the perception of
       such pain and this perception is the effect. The memory
       that it preserves of pain can be very acute, but this does
       not imply any physical sensation. Actually, cold and heat
       cannot disorganize the soul’s tissues – a soul can neither
       freeze nor burn. Every day, do we not see the memory of
       or the concern about a physical ill producing its effects,
       even to the extent of causing death?
       We all know that individuals who have undergone an
       amputation feel pain in the limb that no longer exists. The
       limb is obviously neither the site nor the starting point of
       the pain; the brain itself has simply retained the impression.
       Likewise, we can assume there is something similar in the
       sufferings of spirits after death. An in-depth study of the
       perispirit, which plays such an important role in all spirit
       phenomena, such as vaporous or tangible apparitions,


                                 208

                       Spirit Life


in the state of the spirit at the moment of death, in the
so-frequent notion that it is still alive, in the frightening
situation of suicides, in those who have undergone capital
punishment, in those who have overindulged in material
pleasures, and so many other facts, have shed light on this
question, providing the explanations that we are presenting
here in summary.
The perispirit is the link that unites the spirit with the
matter of the body. It is drawn from the environment, from
the universal fluid. At the same time, it contains electricity,
magnetic fluid and to a certain extent, inert matter. We
could say that it is the quintessence of matter. It is the
beginning of organic life but not of mental life, because
that belongs to the spirit. The perispirit is also the agent
of external sensations. In the body, these sensations are
localized in the organs that serve as their channels. When
the body is destroyed, the sensations become generalized,
and that is why a spirit does not say that it suffers more in its
head than in its feet. Moreover, we have to be on our guard
against being confused as to the sensations of the perispirit,
which have become independent of the sensations of the
body; we can only take the latter as a term of comparison
and not as an analogy. Freed from the body, the spirit may
suffer, but this suffering is not the same as that of the body;
however, it is not an exclusively mental suffering either, like
remorse, because the spirit may complain of being hot or
cold. Nevertheless, it suffers no more in summer than in
winter. We have seen spirits pass through flames without
feeling any pain, showing that temperature has no effect on
them. The pain they do feel is not physical pain per se; it
is a vague inner sensation, of which the spirit is not always
aware because the pain is not localized or produced by an
outside agent. It is a memory rather than a reality, but a very

                          209

                                 Part Two – Chapter VI


           painful memory nonetheless. At other times, it is more than
           a memory, as we shall see.
           Experience has taught us that the perispirit disengages
           itself more or less slowly from the body at the moment
           of death. During the first few moments, the spirit does
           not comprehend its situation – it does not think it has
           died, because it feels alive. It sees its body at its side and
           knows that it is its own, but does not understand why
           they are separate. This state lasts as long as there is a link
           between the body and the perispirit. A suicide once said
           to us, “No, I’m not dead,” and added, “yet, I can feel the
           worms devouring me.” Of course, the worms were not
           devouring the perispirit, let alone the spirit, but only
           the body. Since the separation between the body and the
           perispirit was not yet complete, there continued to be a
           mental repercussion that transmitted the sensation to the
           body. Repercussion is not quite the right term, however,
           since it may imply a highly physical effect. It was rather
           the sight of what was happening within the body itself;
           the perispirit was still attached, producing an illusion
           which was taken as real. Thus, it was not a memory of
           a past occurrence – its body had never been devoured by
           worms during life – but a current sensation. With these
           elements in mind, let us see what conclusions we might
           draw from these facts by studying them carefully. During
           life, the body receives impressions and transmits them
           to the spirit via the perispirit, which probably comprises
           what is called the neural fluid.45 When it is dead, the body
           no longer feels anything because it has neither spirit nor
 		“[The]… instrument that is indispensable for the soul to relate to the outside world. Since
45

  by its very nature the ‘neural fluid’ is very material and coarse, it is necessarily separate
  from the soul itself, but becomes more rarified as the soul becomes sublimated and
  gradually approaches the radiant nature of the spirit ….” (Bozzano, Ernesto. Metapsíquica
  Humana, FEB., 1992, p. 130 – translation ours.) – Tr.



                                            210

                       Spirit Life


perispirit. When disengaged from the body, the perispirit
experiences sensation, but since sensation no longer reaches
it via a limited channel, it becomes generalized. Since the
perispirit is only an agent of transmission – because only
the spirit possesses consciousness – we may deduce that if
the perispirit could exist without the spirit, the perispirit
would feel no more than the dead body. Likewise, if the
spirit had no perispirit, it would be inaccessible to any
painful sensation whatsoever, as is the case with completely
purified spirits. We know that the more a spirit purifies
itself, the more etherealized the essence of its perispirit
becomes, so that material influences diminish as the spirit
progresses; that is, as its perispirit becomes less coarse.
You might say, however, that if pleasant sensations are
transmitted to the spirit via the perispirit, so are unpleasant
ones, and if a pure spirit is inaccessible to some, it must be
equally inaccessible to others: yes, without a doubt, but only
those sensations coming from the influence of the matter
with which we are familiar. The sound of our instruments
and the smell of our flowers make no impression whatsoever
on a pure spirit, yet it enjoys inner sensations of indefinable
enchantment, of which we do not have the slightest idea,
because they are as imperceptible to us as light is to those born
blind. We know they exist, but in what way? Our knowledge
ends there. We know that spirits have perception, sensation,
hearing and sight, but these faculties are attributes of their
whole being, not only of certain organs, as is the case with
human beings. But once again, how is this so? That is what we
do not know. The spirits themselves cannot explain it to us,
because our language was not made to express ideas that we
cannot conceive of, just as in the language of primitive tribes
there are no terms for the expression of our arts, sciences and
philosophical doctrines.

                          211

                Part Two – Chapter VI


In saying that spirits are inaccessible to the impressions of
matter, we are referring to the most evolved spirits, whose
etherealized envelope finds no analogy in this world. It is
different with spirits whose perispirit is denser, because
they perceive our sounds and our odors, but not via a
limited part of their organism as when alive. We may say
that molecular vibrations are felt throughout their entire
being and therefore in their sensorium commune – the spirit
itself – but in a different manner, and perhaps producing
a different impression, which may cause a modification
in their perception. They hear the sound of our voice, and
yet they can understand us without the need of speech –
the mere transmission of thought is sufficient, attesting
to the fact that their mental acuity becomes greater the
more dematerialized they become. The faculty of sight
is independent of light; it is an essential attribute of the
soul (for which darkness does not exist) and shows itself
to be broader and more penetrating among those who
are more purified. Therefore, the soul or spirit possesses
within itself the faculty of all perceptions. During
corporeal life, these perceptions are obliterated by the
denseness of our organs; during extra-corporeal life,
they become increasingly liberated as the semi-material
envelope becomes more and more etherealized.
Drawn from the surrounding environment, the perispirit
varies according to the nature of the different worlds. In
passing from one world to another, spirits change this
envelope as we change our clothes when we go from
summer to winter or from pole to equator. When they
come to visit us, the more evolved spirits assume a terrestrial
perispirit, and so their perceptions are similar to those of
common spirits; however, all spirits, whether highly evolved
or not, only hear and feel what they want to hear and feel.

                         212

                      Spirit Life


Since they do not have sensorial organs, they can render
their perceptions active or inactive at will, although there
is one thing they are compelled to hear: the counsels of
good spirits. Their sight is always active but they can
become invisible to one another. Depending on the class
they belong to, they can conceal themselves from those who
are less purified but not from those who are more so. In
the first moments after death, a spirit’s sight is always dim
and confused, but becomes clearer as it frees itself from the
body, and can acquire even more clarity than it had during
life, including the possibility of penetrating objects that are
opaque to us. As for the extension of a spirit’s sight into
indefinite space, into the future and the past, that depends
on the spirit’s degree of purity and evolution.
You might say, “This entire theory is not very reassuring. We
had thought that, once freed from our dense envelope – the
instrument of our pains – we wouldn’t suffer anymore. Now
you’re telling us that we can continue to suffer; whether it
is one way or another it is suffering nonetheless.” Alas, yes,
we can still suffer a great deal and for a long time, but we
might also no longer experience any suffering at all from the
moment we leave this corporeal life behind.
The sufferings of this world are sometimes the result of a
cause outside ourselves, but more often they result from
our own volition. If we trace them back to their origin, we
will see that most of them are due to causes we could have
avoided. How many ills, how many infirmities do people
owe solely to their excesses and ambitions – in a word, to
their passions? If individuals always lived judiciously and
never abused anything, if they always had simple tastes
and modest desires, they would save themselves many
tribulations. The same applies to spirits: the sufferings they


                         213

                 Part Two – Chapter VI


undergo always result from the manner in which they lived
on the earth. Of course, they will no longer have gout or
rheumatism, but they will experience other sufferings that
are not any smaller. We have seen that such sufferings are
the result of the links that still exist between the spirit and
matter, that the more the spirit is disconnected from the
influence of matter, that is, the more dematerialized it is,
the fewer painful sensations it will suffer. Starting with its
present life, it depends on the spirit itself to break free from
the influence of matter because it has free will and therefore
the ability to choose to act or not. Let the spirit conquer its
animal passions; let it entertain no hatred, envy, jealousy
or pride; let it cease to be dominated by selfishness; let it
purify itself through good sentiments; let it practice the
good; let it not give to the things of this world any more
importance than they deserve. Thereby, even while in its
corporeal envelope, it will have purified itself by detaching
from matter, and when it leaves the body behind, it will not
suffer any longer from its influence. The physical sufferings
the spirit underwent in the past will leave no painful
memory or disagreeable impressions, because these affected
only the body. The spirit is happy to be relieved of them,
and its peaceful conscience will exempt it from all mental
anguish. Concerning this subject, we have questioned many
thousands of spirits who belonged to every social class and
to every position. We have studied them at every period
of their spirit life from the moment they left their body
behind. We have followed them step by step in that life
beyond the grave in order to observe the changes that had
taken place in their ideas and sensations. In this respect, the
most ordinary individuals were the ones who furnished us
with the most precious elements of study. We have seen that
their sufferings are always related to their conduct – they


                         214

                             Spirit Life


       must suffer the consequences – and that this new existence
       is a source of ineffable happiness for those who have taken
       the path of the good. Hence, it follows that for those who
       suffer, it is because they have wanted to, and they have only
       themselves to blame in the other world as in this one.


                 The Choice of Trials
258.   While in the errant state and before a new corporeal existence,
       does a spirit have the awareness and foresight of what will
       happen to it during its new lifetime?
       “The spirit itself chooses the kinds of trials it will undergo.
       Its free will consists in doing so.”
       – Then it is not God who imposes the tribulations of life on it
       as a chastisement?
       “Nothing happens without God’s permission, because
       it was God who established all the laws that govern the
       universe. You may as well ask why God made such and
       such a law instead of some other one! In giving a spirit
       freedom of choice, God leaves to it the entire responsibility
       for its acts and their consequences. Nothing stands in the
       way of its future. The path of the good or the path of evil
       is an open choice. If the spirit succumbs to its trials, there
       is still the consolation that not everything is lost, because
       God, out of divine goodness, allows it to start over where
       it failed. It is necessary to distinguish between what is the
       work of God’s will and what is the work of human will. If
       a danger threatens you, it is not you who have created it,
       but God. However, you have willingly exposed yourself to
       it, because you saw it as a way to advance, and God has
       allowed it to happen.”


                                215

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


259.   If our spirit chooses the kinds of trials it will undergo, are all
       the tribulations of life therefore foreseen and chosen by us?
       “Not all of them, because it cannot be said that you have
       chosen and foreseen everything that happens to you in the
       world – not even the smallest things. You have chosen the
       kinds of trials; the details are consequences of the position
       you have chosen, and frequently, of your own actions. If
       a spirit has been born among evildoers, for example, it
       already knew what kind of temptations it would face, but
       it did not know how it would act in any given situation;
       its actions are the products of its volition or free will. In
       choosing a particular path, a spirit knows it will have to
       endure the struggles that arise thereon and it knows the
       nature of the tribulations it will encounter, but it does
       not know what events await it. The details spring from
       circumstances and the force of things. Only the major
       events that will influence its destiny are foreseen. If you
       walk down a path full of ruts, you know you must be very
       cautious because you run the risk of tripping, but you do
       not know when you will trip, and maybe you will not
       trip at all if you are sufficiently on your guard. If you are
       walking down the sidewalk and a tile falls on your head,
       you must not think that it was ‘written beforehand’, as it
       is commonly said.”
260.   Why would a spirit want to be born among evildoers?
       “It has to be sent into the environment in which it can
       experience its requested trial. To this end, it must find an
       analogous situation; for example, in order to struggle against
       the instinct of thievery, it must dwell among thieves.”
       – If there were no longer any evil individuals on earth,
       would spirits not be able to find the necessary conditions for
       certain trials?


                                 216

                              Spirit Life


       “And would that be something to regret? That is what
       happens on highly evolved worlds, where evil has no
       access; thus only good spirits dwell on them. Use all your
       efforts to ensure that the same happens as soon as possible
       on your earth.”
261.   In the trials it has to undergo to reach perfection, must a
       spirit experience every type of temptation possible? In other
       words, will it have to go through all the circumstances that
       can trigger pride, jealousy, greed, lust, etc.?
       “Of course not. You should be aware of the fact that
       there are those who from the beginning have taken a road
       that has spared them many trials, but those who allow
       themselves to be led along the evil road risk all its dangers.
       For instance, a spirit may ask for wealth and it will be
       given. Then, depending on its character, it may become
       greedy or wasteful, selfish or generous, or it may indulge
       in all the pleasures of sensuality. This, however, does not
       mean that it had to succumb to all those tendencies.”
262.   How can a spirit, who at its origin is simple, ignorant
       and inexperienced, consciously choose an existence and be
       responsible for its choices?
       “God compensates for its inexperience by outlining the
       path it should follow, as you do for a child from birth.
       However, as the spirit’s free will develops, God gradually
       leaves it the freedom to choose its own way. It is at this
       point that the spirit will choose the wrong path if it does
       not listen to the advice of good spirits. This is what we
       may call the ‘fall of man’.”
       – When a spirit enjoys its free will, does the choice of its next
       corporeal existence always depend solely on its own volition, or
       can it be imposed on the spirit by God’s will as an expiation?


                                 217

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


       “God knows how to wait: God never hastens expiation.
       Nevertheless, God can impose a certain existence on a
       spirit when, due to its impurity or ill will, it is not capable
       of determining what would be most useful, and when God
       sees that such an existence could serve for its purification
       and advancement, and at the same time, its expiation.”
263.   Do spirits make their choice immediately after death?
       “No, because many of them believe in eternal punishment,
       and as we have already told you, this in itself is a punishment.”
264.   What guides a spirit in choosing the trials it wants to bear?
       “It chooses what may serve as an expiation according to the
       nature of its wrongs and whatever might enable it to evolve
       more quickly. Some spirits may impose a life of poverty
       and hardship on themselves in order to try to bear it with
       courage. Others may wish to experience the temptations of
       fortune and power, which are much more dangerous than
       poverty because of the abuse and ill use that may be made
       of them, and because of the base passions they encourage.
       Still others may desire to be tested in the struggles they
       will have to bear in the contact with various vices.”
265.   If some spirits choose contact with vice as a trial, are there
       others who choose it out of affinity and the desire to live in
       surroundings that cater to their tastes, or where they may give
       free rein to their materialistic tendencies?
       “Of course there are, but only among those whose moral
       sense is still underdeveloped; the trial derives from this, and
       they must endure it for a longer time. Sooner or later, they
       will understand that satisfying their crude passions has
       deplorable consequences, which they will have to endure
       for a period that will seem like an eternity. God may leave
       them in this state until they have understood their wrongs


                                 218

                                  Spirit Life


       and then ask for the means of redeeming them through
       profitable trials.”
266.   Wouldn’t it be natural for a spirit to choose the least painful
       trials possible?
       “For you, yes; for the spirit, no. Once it has freed itself
       from matter, illusion disappears and it thinks differently.”
         Human beings, subjected to the influence of carnal ideas on earth, only
         see the painful side of their trials. That is why it seems logical that they
         would choose those which, from their own point of view, may coexist with
         material pleasures. However, in the spirit life, they compare such crude
         and fleeting pleasures with the unchangeable happiness of which they
         get a glimpse; then, of what importance are a few temporary hardships?
         A spirit may therefore choose the hardest trial, and consequently the
         most painful existence, hoping to arrive at a better state more quickly,
         just as a patient often chooses the nastiest medicine in order to be healed
         more quickly. Explorers who aspire to having their name linked to the
         discovery of an unknown country do not choose a course covered with
         flowers; they know the dangers they will have to face but they also know
         the glory awaiting them if they succeed.
         The doctrine of the freedom to choose our lives and the trials we
         must undergo ceases to seem unusual when we consider the fact
         that when spirits are disengaged from matter, they judge things
         differently than we do. They foresee the goal, and that goal seems
         far more important than the fleeting pleasures of the world. After
         each existence, they see the steps they have already taken and they
         understand what they yet lack in purity to reach the goal. That
         is the reason why they willingly submit to all the vicissitudes of
         corporeal life, even requesting the ones that will help them arrive
         more quickly. Therefore, it should not be surprising to us that a
         spirit does not prefer a softer life. In its state of imperfection, it
         cannot enjoy life without suffering; it can get only a glimpse of the
         goal, and it is for reaching it that it seeks to improve itself.
         Do we not see similar examples every day? Do individuals who work
         part of their life without rest or respite in order to accumulate what


                                      219

                 Part Two – Chapter VI


is necessary for their well-being perform a self-imposed task with a
view to a better future? Do not soldiers who volunteer for a perilous
mission or explorers who confront dangers no less formidable in the
interest of science or their own fortune willingly submit themselves
to trials that will bring them honor and profit if they overcome
them? What will people not submit or expose themselves to for their
own gain or glory? Are not all competitive examinations voluntary
trials for improving in a chosen career? No one arrives at a highly
important social position in the sciences, arts or industry without
going through a series of lower positions, which in themselves are
other types of trials. Human life is thus a copy of the spirit life; we
find incidents of the latter in the former, only on a smaller scale. If
during our time on earth we often choose the most difficult trials,
with a view to evolving further, why would a spirit, who sees even
farther down the road, and for whom earthly life is only a fleeting
incident, not choose a painful and laborious existence if it will lead
it toward eternal happiness? Those who say that if they could choose
their existence they would ask to be princes or millionaires are like
the near-sighted who cannot see what they touch. They are like
gluttonous children who, when asked what they want to be when
they grow up answer, “a cake baker or candy maker.”
Likewise, hikers in the depths of a fog-obscured valley see neither
the length nor breadth of their path, but upon reaching the top of
a mountain, they behold the path they have traveled and how far
they still must travel and the obstacles that they must still overcome;
hence, they choose the surest means to reach their goal. Incarnate
spirits are like hikers in the depths of the valley: when freed of earthly
ties, it is as though they have reached the top of the mountain. For
the hiker, the goal is rest after a wearisome trek; for the spirit, it is
supreme happiness after its trials and tribulations.
All spirits say that in the errant state they search, study and observe
in order to make their choices. Do we not have an example of this
in the corporeal life? Do we not often spend years searching for a
career, which we end up choosing because we think it to be the
most suitable for our goals? If we fail at that one, we seek another.
Each career we embrace is a phase, a period of our life. Do we not



                            220

                                 Spirit Life


         spend each day choosing what we will do tomorrow? So what are its
         different corporeal lives to a spirit except phases, periods and days of
         its spirit life, which, as we know, is the normal one? The corporeal
         life is nothing more than transitory and temporary.

267.   Can a spirit choose its next corporeal life during its
       present one?
       “Its desire may have an influence, depending on its
       intention. In the spirit state, however, it frequently sees
       things quite differently. It is the spirit as such that makes
       the choice; but even so, it may make it during its material
       life because a spirit always has moments in which it is
       independent of the matter it inhabits.”
       – Don’t many individuals desire greatness and wealth, but
       not as an expiation or a trial?
       “Undoubtedly. It is the flesh that desires greatness and
       wealth in order to enjoy them, but it is the spirit who
       desires them in order to experience the tribulations they
       can cause.”
268.   Until it reaches the state of perfect purity, does a spirit have to
       constantly undergo trials?
       “Yes, but they are not as you understand them; you call
       material tribulations trials. Even though it may not yet be
       perfect, a spirit who reaches a certain degree does not have
       any more trials to endure. However, it always has non-
       suffering duties consisting in helping others to improve
       themselves; these will in turn help it evolve further.”
269.   Can a spirit be mistaken as to the effectiveness of a trial it
       chooses?
       “It may choose one that exceeds its strength, and then it
       succumbs. It may also choose one that will not be profitable
       at all; for example, a kind of idle and useless life. In such a

                                    221

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


       case, however, upon returning to the spirit world it realizes
       that it has gained nothing and asks to make up for lost time.”
270.   Why do persons have certain vocations or the desire to follow
       one career instead of another?
       “It seems to me that you can answer this question
       yourselves. Isn’t it the result of everything we have said
       about the choice of trials and the progress accomplished
       in a preceding existence?”
271.   When a spirit in the errant state studies the conditions that
       will enable it to progress, how could it possibly imagine it
       could do so by being born among cannibals?
       “Spirits who have already advanced are not born among
       cannibals – only those of the same nature as cannibals, or
       those who are even less evolved.”
        We know that our cannibals are not at the lowest degree of the
        scale and that there are worlds where brutality and ferocity have no
        comparison on earth. Such spirits are therefore even less evolved
        than the least evolved on our world. To be among our cannibals
        is progress for them, just as it would be progress for our cannibals
        to exercise a profession among us that would require them to shed
        blood. If they aim no higher, it is because their moral impurity does
        not allow them to comprehend a more complete progress. A spirit
        cannot advance except gradually; it cannot simply leap over the gap
        between barbarity and civility. In this resides one of the necessities
        of reincarnation, truly showing it to be in accord with God’s justice;
        otherwise, what would become of the millions of beings who die
        every day in the ultimate state of degradation if they had no means
        of lifting themselves out of it? Why would God withhold from
        them the favors granted to others?

272.   Can spirits who come from a world that is less evolved than
       earth or from a much less advanced people, such as cannibals,
       be born amongst civilized people?


                                  222

                                 Spirit Life


       “Yes, there are those who go astray by wanting to ascend
       too quickly, but they are out of place among you. They
       display habits and instincts that clash with yours.”
         Such beings present us with the sad spectacle of ferocity in the
         midst of civility. Returning to live among cannibals would not be a
         regression for them, because it would be no more than a resumption
         of their proper place, even perhaps with some advantage.

273.   Could a person belonging to a civilized culture reincarnate
       into a less advanced one as an expiation?
       “Yes, but it would depend on the kind of expiation. Masters
       who had been cruel to their servants might become servants
       themselves and suffer the harsh treatment they used to
       inflict on others. Those who gave orders at one time might,
       in a new existence, obey those who formerly bent to their
       will. This would be an expiation if they used to abuse their
       power, and God can impose it on them. Furthermore, a
       good spirit may choose an influential life among such a
       culture to enable it to advance; in that case, it is a mission.”

        Relationships beyond the Grave
274.   Do the different orders of spirits establish a hierarchy of powers,
       and is there subordination and authority among them?
       “Very much so. Spirits have authority over one another
       relative to their degree of evolution and exert it through
       an irresistible moral ascendancy.”
       – Can low order spirits evade the authority of those who are
       more evolved?
       “I said: irresistible.”
275.   Do the power and influence that individuals enjoy on earth
       warrant them any supremacy in the spirit world?


                                    223

                          Part Two – Chapter VI


       “No, because the lowly will be exalted and the great will be
       abased. Read the Psalms.”
       – How should we understand this exalting and abasing?
       “Don’t you already know that spirits are of different orders
       according to their merits? Well then, the greatest on earth
       may be in the last class among the spirits, while their
       servants may be in the first. Don’t you understand this?
       Didn’t Jesus say: ‘Whosoever humbles himself shall be
       exalted, and whosoever exalts himself shall be humbled?’”
276.   Don’t those who were great on earth but find themselves
       abased among the spirits feel humiliation?
       “Of course, they almost always feel greatly humiliated,
       especially if they had been proud and jealous.”
277.   After a battle, does a soldier who meets his general in the spirit
       world still acknowledge him as his superior?
       “The title is nothing. True superiority is everything.”
278.   Are the spirits of different orders mixed together?
       “Yes and no; that is, they may see each other but they are
       distinguished from each other. They avoid or approach one
       another according to the similarity or dissimilarity of their
       sentiments, as is also the case amongst you. It is an entire
       world in and of itself and yours is only a dim reflection of it.
       Those of the same order are drawn together by a sort of
       affinity, and they form groups or families of spirits united
       by sympathy and purpose: the good ones, by their desire
       to do good; the evil ones, by their desire to do evil, by
       shame for their wrongs and by the need to find themselves
       among others like them.”
         This is exactly like a large city, where individuals of all social classes
         and conditions see and meet one another without mixing together,


                                     224

                                Spirit Life


         where societies are formed by similarities in tastes, and where vice
         and virtue jostle each other without speaking.

279.   Do all spirits have mutual access to one another?
       “The good ones go everywhere; it must be this way in
       order to bring their influence to bear upon the evil ones.
       Nevertheless, the realms inhabited by the good ones are
       forbidden to the imperfect ones so that the latter cannot
       bring their evil passions there.”
280.   What is the nature of the relationship between good and
       evil spirits?
       “The good ones seek to combat the evil tendencies of the
       others in order to help them evolve – it is a mission.”
281.   Why do certain low order spirits take pleasure in inducing
       us to evil?
       “They do so out of spite for not having deserved to
       be among the good ones. Their desire is to prevent
       inexperienced spirits, as much as possible, from attaining
       the supreme good. They want to make others experience
       what they themselves are experiencing. Don’t you see the
       same amongst yourselves?”
282.   How do spirits communicate with one another?
       “They see and comprehend one another. Speech is material:
       it is a reflection of the spirit. The universal fluid establishes
       a constant communication among them; it is the vehicle
       for the transmission of thought, as the air is for you the
       vehicle for sound. It is a sort of universal telegraph line
       that connects all worlds, enabling spirits to communicate
       from one world to another.”
283.   Can spirits disguise their thoughts and hide themselves from
       each other?


                                   225

                       Part Two – Chapter VI


       “No, everything is out in the open for them, especially
       when they are perfect. They may be apart from each other
       but they always see each other. This is not an absolute
       rule, however, since certain spirits can very easily make
       themselves invisible to others if they deem it useful.”
284.   Since spirits no longer have a body, how can they establish
       their own individuality and make themselves recognizable to
       others around them?
       “They establish their individuality by means of their
       perispirit, which makes them distinct from one another,
       as do bodies among humans.”
285.   Do spirits recognize each other after having lived here on
       earth? Does the son recognize his father and the friend, her
       friend?
       “Yes, and thus from generation to generation.”
       – How do those who knew each other on earth recognize each
       other in the spirit world?
       “We see our past life and read it there as if it were a book.
       As we watch the friends and enemies of our past, we also
       witness their passage from life to death.”
286.   Upon leaving its mortal remains behind, does the soul
       immediately see the relatives and friends who had preceded it
       into the spirit world?
       “Not always immediately. As we have already said, it
       requires some time to recognize its situation and shake off
       the material veil.”
287.   How is the soul received upon its return to the spirit world?
       “The soul of the just, as a beloved and long awaited bother
       or sister; the soul of the wicked, as a despised being.”


                                226

                                       Spirit Life


288.      What sentiment do impure spirits experience at the sight of
          another evil spirit who has just arrived?
          “Evil spirits are pleased at seeing beings who resemble them
          and who are deprived, like they are, of infinite happiness.
          Just like on earth, it is a rascal among equals.”
289.      Do our relatives and friends sometimes come to meet us when
          we leave the earth?
          “Yes, they come to meet the soul they love. If it has escaped
          the dangers of the road, they congratulate it as though it were
          returning from a journey, and they help it to break free of its
          corporeal bonds. It is a blessing granted to good spirits when
          those who love them come to meet them; on the other hand,
          those who are blemished remain in isolation or are surrounded
          only by spirits like themselves – it is a punishment.”
290.      Are relatives and friends always reunited after death?
          “That depends on how evolved they are and the path
          they are following for their advancement. If one of them
          is more advanced and progresses more quickly than the
          other, they cannot remain together. They may see each
          other occasionally, but they will not be reunited until they
          can walk side by side, or when they have reached equality
          of purification. Moreover, being kept from seeing relatives
          and friends is sometimes a punishment.”

                Sympathies and Antipathies
               among Spirits. Eternal Halves
291.      Besides a general sympathy46 that results from various
          similarities, are there special affections among spirits?
 		See the footnotes to nos. 211 and 213 for the definitions of sympathy and sympathetic in
46

  this context – Tr.



                                           227

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


       “Yes, just as among humans; however, the link that unites
       spirits is stronger in the absence of the body because they
       are no longer exposed to the vicissitudes of the passions.”
292.   Is there hatred among spirits?
       “There is no hatred except among impure spirits, and these
       are the ones who sow enmity and dissensions amongst you.”
293.   Will two beings who were enemies on earth retain their
       resentment in the spirit world?
       “No, usually they will understand that their hatred was
       senseless and its motive childish. Only imperfect spirits
       retain a sort of animosity until they are purified. If it was
       nothing more than a material interest that had separated
       them, they will no longer think about it no matter how little
       dematerialized they are. If there is no antipathy between
       them, and if the cause of their dissension no longer exists,
       they can meet each other again with pleasure.”
         Exactly like two schoolboys who, having reached the age of reason,
         realize the childishness of their infantile quarrels and no longer
         hold a grudge.

294.   Is the remembrance of the wrongs that two individuals have
       committed against each other an obstacle to their sympathy?
       “Yes, it makes them keep their distance from each other.”
295.   What sentiment do those whom we have wronged in this
       world experience after death?
       “If they are good, they forgive you according to your
       repentance. If they are evil, they may hold on to their
       resentment and at times even pursue you in another
       existence. God can allow this as a chastisement.”
296.   Are spirits’ personal affections susceptible to change?



                                  228

                              Spirit Life


       “No, because they cannot be mistaken about each other;
       they can no longer deceive each other. They no longer wear the
       mask behind which hypocrites hide themselves and that is why
       their affections are unchangeable when they are pure spirits.
       The love that unites them is a source of supreme bliss.”
297.   Does the affection that two beings had for each other on earth
       always continue in the spirit world?
       “Yes, of course, if it is based on true sympathy; however, if
       physical attraction has had more influence than sympathy,
       it will cease with the cause. Affections among spirits are
       more solid and lasting than on earth because they are
       not subject to the whims of material interests and self-
       centeredness.”
298.   Are souls who must get together predestined for such a union from
       their origin, and does each one of us have, in some part of the
       universe, “our other half”, whom we will someday inevitably join?
       “No, there is no particular and predestined union
       between two souls. Unity exists among all spirits, but
       in different degrees, according to the order they occupy,
       i.e. according to their degree of purification. The greater
       their purification, the more united they are. All the ills of
       humankind are born from discord; concord gives rise to
       complete happiness.”
299.   In what sense should we understand the term “other half ”,
       which certain spirits use to designate sympathetic spirits?
       “The expression is incorrect. If one spirit were another
       spirit’s other half, it would be incomplete when separate
       from the other.”
300.   When two perfectly sympathetic spirits are united, will they
       remain so throughout eternity, or can they separate and unite


                                 229

                           Part Two – Chapter VI


       with other spirits?
       “All spirits are mutually united. I am referring to those who
       have already reached perfection. In less evolved spheres,
       after a spirit has improved itself, it no longer has the same
       sympathy for those whom it has left behind.”
301.   Are two sympathetic spirits each other’s complement or is such
       sympathy the result of perfect affinity?
       “The sympathy that attracts one spirit to another is the
       result of the perfect harmony of their tendencies and
       instincts. If one of them were necessary to complete the
       other, it would lose its individuality.”
302.   Does the affinity needed for perfect sympathy consist only in a
       similarity of thoughts and sentiments, or does it also consist in
       a uniformity of acquired knowledge?
       “It consists in the degree of their evolution.”
303.   Could spirits who are not sympathetic today become more so later?
       “Yes, all will be someday. Thus, when a spirit who today
       inhabits a certain less evolved sphere is perfected, it will
       reach the sphere where the other dwells. Their reunion will
       occur more quickly, however, if the more evolved spirit has
       remained at a standstill because it has poorly borne the
       trials to which it submitted itself.”
       – May two sympathetic spirits cease to be sympathetic?
       “Certainly, if one of them is idle.”
         The theory of “eternal halves” is an image that represents the union
         of two sympathetic spirits. It is an expression used even in ordinary
         parlance and must not be taken literally. Spirits who have used it
         certainly do not belong to the highest order. The sphere of their ideas
         is necessarily limited, and they express their thought through the terms
         they used in corporeal life. We must reject this idea of two spirits created


                                      230

                                Spirit Life


         for each other, who must someday be inevitably reunited in eternity
         after having remained separated for a more or less long span of time.

 The Remembrance of Corporeal Existence
304.   Does the spirit remember its corporeal existence?
       “Yes, having lived many times as a human being, it
       remembers what it has been, and I assure you that
       sometimes it laughs, pitying its behavior.”
         Like an individual who, having reached the age of reason, laughs at
         the antics of youth or the puerilities of childhood.

305.   Does the memory of its last corporeal existence completely and
       unexpectedly return to the spirit after death?
       “No, it returns little by little, like something that appears
       out of the fog, and to the degree that the spirit fixes its
       attention on it.”
306.   Does the spirit remember all the events of its life in detail,
       assimilating the whole in one retrospective glance?
       “It remembers things according to the consequences they hold
       for its situation as a spirit; but you should understand that
       there are circumstances to which it attributes no importance
       whatsoever and which it does not even try to remember.”
       – Could it remember them if it wanted to?
       “It can recall the minutest details and incidents – events or
       even thoughts – but when such has no usefulness, it does
       not do so.”
       – Does it see the purpose of its past earthly life in relation to
       its future life?
       “Assuredly, it sees and understands it much better than
       when it lived in the body. It understands the need for


                                   231

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


       purification in order to reach the infinite, and it knows that
       during each existence it frees itself from a few impurities.”
307.   How does its past life unfold in its memory? By an effort of the
       imagination, or like a picture it holds before its eyes?
       “Both ways. All the actions that it has an interest in
       remembering are as if they were present. The others remain
       more or less at the back of its memory or are entirely forgotten.
       The more dematerialized it is, the less importance it attributes
       to material things. You often evoke an errant spirit who has
       just left the earth and does not remember the names of the
       people it has loved or the details that seem important to you.
       That is because it is no longer concerned with them and they
       have fallen into forgottenness. What it remembers very well,
       however, are the main events that have aided in its progress.”
308.   Does the spirit remember all the lives that preceded the one it
       has just left behind?
       “Its entire past unfolds before it like the legs of a journey.
       However, as we have already stated, it does not recall
       all its actions with absolute precision, and it remembers
       them only according to the influence they have upon its
       present state. As for its earliest existences, those that may
       be regarded as the spirit’s infancy, they are lost in the void
       and disappear into the night of forgottenness.”
309.   How does the spirit regard the body it has just left behind?
       “As an ill-fitting garment that has inconvenienced it, and
       which it feels happy to have gotten rid of.”
       – What sentiment does it experience at the sight of its body
       decomposing?
       “Almost always indifference. It is a thing it no longer cares
       about.”


                                 232

                                Spirit Life


310.   After a certain amount of time has elapsed, does the spirit
       recognize its bones or other things that had belonged to it?
       “Sometimes, depending on the more or less evolved way
       in which it regards terrestrial things.”
311.   Does the respect we have for the material things that a spirit
       has left behind attract its attention to them, and does it regard
       such respect with pleasure?
       “A spirit is always happy at being remembered. The things
       we save that once belonged to it awaken its memories, but
       it is the thought that attracts it to you and not the objects
       themselves.”
312.   Do spirits hold on to the memory of the sufferings they bore
       during their last corporeal existence?
       “They frequently do and this memory enables them to
       better appreciate the happiness they now enjoy as spirits.”
313.   Do humans who were happy on earth regret the pleasures they
       left behind?
       “Only low order spirits could regret the pleasures which
       correspond to the impurities of their nature, and which
       they must expiate through suffering. For more evolved
       spirits, eternal happiness is a thousand times preferable to
       the fleeting pleasures of earth.”
         This is exactly like mature individuals who no longer care about the
         things that delighted them in childhood.

314.   Do those who have begun great works intended for a useful
       purpose, but which they see interrupted by death, lament at
       having left them unfinished?
       “No, because they understand that others are meant to
       complete them. On the contrary, they try to influence
       other human spirits to continue them. Their aim on earth

                                   233

                          Part Two – Chapter VI


       was the wellness of humankind; that aim is the same in the
       spirit world.”
315.   Do those who leave their works of art or literature behind
       retain the love they had for them during life?
       “Depending on how much they have evolved, they often
       judge them differently and frequently disapprove of what
       they most admired.”
316.   Does the spirit still have an interest in the works that are
       being done on earth for the progress of the arts and sciences?
       “Again, it depends on how much it has evolved or on the
       mission it may have to fulfill. What appears magnificent
       to you is often a small matter indeed to certain spirits, who
       admire it like a scholar admires the work of a student. They
       examine only that which can demonstrate the elevation
       and progress of incarnate spirits.”
317.   After death, do spirits retain their love for their native land?
       “It is always the same principle: for high order spirits, their
       native land is the universe; on earth it is the place in which
       there is the greatest number of people sympathetic to them.”
         The situation of spirits and their way of looking at things are
         infinitely varied according to the degree of their moral and
         intellectual development. Spirits of the higher orders generally make
         only brief stopovers on earth since everything that is done here is so
         paltry in comparison with the grandeurs of the infinite. The things
         that humans attribute the most importance to are so childish to
         them that this world offers them very little attraction unless they
         have been called to it in order to cooperate in humankind’s progress.
         Spirits of an average order are the ones who more frequently stay
         here, although they regard things from a more elevated point of
         view than when incarnate. Ordinary spirits are somewhat sedentary
         and they comprise the mass of the surrounding population of the
         invisible world. With little difference, they hold on to the same ideas,


                                    234

                                 Spirit Life


         tastes, and tendencies they had in their corporeal envelope. They get
         involved in our meetings, our businesses and our entertainments,
         in which they take part more or less actively according to their
         character. Since they can no longer satisfy their passions, they take
         pleasure in being with those who have handed themselves over to
         theirs and they excite them in such individuals. Nonetheless, among
         them there are some who are more serious, and who watch and
         observe in order to acquire knowledge and evolve.

318.   Do spirits’ ideas change in the spirit life?
       “Very considerably; their ideas undergo large modifications
       as they become more dematerialized. They may sometimes
       hold on to the same ideas for a long time, but little by little
       the influence of matter diminishes and they see things
       more clearly. It is then that they seek ways to improve.”
319.   Since the spirit had already lived the spirit life before its incarnation,
       why is it so astonished when it re-enters the spirit world?
       “That is only the effect of the first moments and the state
       of confusion following its awakening. Later, it recognizes
       its state perfectly as the memory of the past returns and the
       impression of terrestrial life fades away.” (See no. 163 ff.)


The Commemoration of the Dead. Funerals
320.   Are spirits sensitive to being remembered by those who loved
       them on earth?
       “Much more than you may suppose. Being remembered
       adds to their happiness if they are already happy and
       consoles them if they are despondent.”
321.   Does Memorial Day hold a more solemn meaning for spirits?
       Do they prepare to visit those who will pray over their graves?



                                    235

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


       “Spirits answer to the call of thought on that day as on all
       others.”
       – Is it for them a meeting day at their gravesides?
       “They assemble in greater numbers on that day because
       the number of persons who call to them is larger, but each
       one only pays attention to its friends and not the crowd of
       indifferent people.”
       – In what form do they come and what would they look like
       if they could make themselves visible?
       “They would look like they did while alive.”
322.   Do forgotten spirits, whose graves are not visited by anyone,
       come despite that fact and feel troubled at not seeing any
       friends remembering them?
       “What is the earth to them? They are only linked to it by
       the heart. If no one loves them any longer, there is nothing
       that can make spirits feel connected to the earth. They
       have the whole universe before them.”
323.   Does a visit made to its grave provide more satisfaction to a
       spirit than a prayer made on its behalf in someone’s home?
       “A visit to its grave is a way of showing that one is thinking
       of the absent spirit – it is the exteriorization of the thought.
       I have already told you that it is the prayer that blesses the
       act of remembering. The place itself is of little importance
       if the memory comes from the heart.”
324.   Do the spirits of individuals who are to be honored with
       statues or monuments attend the inaugurations and watch
       them with pleasure?
       “Many watch them when they can, but they are less
       sensitive to the honors paid to them than to the memories.”


                                236

                               Spirit Life


325.   Where does the desire come from where certain persons wish to
       be buried in one place rather than in another? Do they return
       to it with more satisfaction after death? And is the importance
       given to a physical thing a sign of a spirit’s impure nature?
       “A spirit’s affection for certain places is a sign of moral
       impurity. What does one piece of earth represent more
       than another to an evolved spirit? Doesn’t it know that its
       soul will be reunited with its loved ones, even though their
       bones may be far apart?”
       – Should gathering together the mortal remains of all the
       members of a family be considered meaningless?
       “No. It is a pious custom and a witness to the sympathy
       of loved ones. If such gatherings mean little to spirits, they
       are nonetheless useful to humans – their memories are
       better concentrated.”
326.   Is a soul that has returned to life as a spirit sensitive to the
       honors paid to its mortal remains?
       “When a spirit has already reached a certain degree of purification,
       it has no more earthly vanity and it comprehends the futility of
       all these things. Nevertheless, you should know that there are
       spirits who, in the first moments of death, take great satisfaction
       in the honors paid to them. Others become disturbed if they see
       that their envelope is being forgotten, because they still hold on
       to some of the prejudices of this world.”
327.   Do spirits ever watch their own burial?
       “They frequently do, but sometimes they do not perceive
       what is happening if they are still in the state of confusion.”
       – Do they feel flattered by a large gathering at their burial?
       “More so or less so, according to the sentiments of the
       people gathered there.”


                                  237

                        Part Two – Chapter VI


328.   Does the spirit attend the meetings of its heirs?
       “Almost always. God wills it for its instruction and as
       punishment for guilty ones. It is there that the spirit
       judges what its heirs’ declarations of affection are really
       worth. All sentiments become patent to the spirit, and the
       disappointment it feels in seeing the greed of those who
       divide up the spoils makes their true sentiments very clear;
       however, their time shall also come.”
329.   Is the instinctive respect of people for the dead in all times
       and among all cultures the result of the intuition of a future
       existence?
       “It is its natural consequence. Without it, such respect
       would have no meaning.”

                Preludes to the Return
330.   Do spirits know the time when they will have to reincarnate?
       “They can sense it like a blind man who feels the fire he is
       approaching. They know they must return to a body just
       as you know you must die someday, but without knowing
       when it will happen.” (See no. 166)
       – Is reincarnation therefore a necessity of spirit life, as death is
       a necessity of corporeal life?
       “Yes it is.”
331.   Do all spirits concern themselves with their approaching
       reincarnation?


                                  239

                        Part Two – Chapter VII


       “There are those who never give it a thought, who do not
       even comprehend it. It depends on the degree of their
       advancement. For some, uncertainty about their future
       life is a punishment.”
332.   Can spirits hasten or delay the moment of their reincarnation?
       “They may hasten it through strong desire. They may
       also delay it if they recoil from the upcoming trial, since
       among spirits there are cowardly and indifferent ones.
       However, they do not delay it with impunity; they will
       suffer for it, like those who refuse the medicine that can
       restore them to health.”
333.   If a spirit felt quite happy in an average situation among
       discarnate spirits and had no ambition to evolve, could it
       prolong its errant state indefinitely?
       “No, not indefinitely. Advancement is a necessity and
       spirits sense it sooner or later. All must evolve – it is their
       destiny.”
334.   Is the union of a soul with a particular body predestined, or is
       the choice made at the last moment?
       “The spirit is always designated beforehand. In choosing
       the trial it wishes to undergo, the spirit asks to reincarnate,
       and God, who sees and knows everything, sees and
       knows beforehand that a particular soul will unite with a
       particular body.”
335.   Does a spirit have the right to choose the body it will enter, or
       does it only choose the kind of life that will serve as its trial?
       “It may also choose its body because the body’s imperfections
       will be the trials that will help its advancement if it
       overcomes the obstacles it encounters thereby. This choice
       is not always up to the spirit but it may at least ask for it.”


                                 240

                    The Return to Corporeal Life


       – At the last moment, can a spirit refuse to enter the body that
       it has chosen?
       “If it refuses it, it will suffer much more than one who had
       not undertaken a new trial in the first place.”
336.   Could it happen that there might be no spirit who is willing
       to incarnate in a particular unborn child?
       “God would provide for this. When a child is to be born
       alive it is always predestined to have a soul; nothing is
       created without a design.”
337.   Can the union of a spirit with a particular body be imposed
       by God?
       “Such a union may be imposed in the same way as the
       spirit’s other trials, especially when it is not yet able to
       make a conscious choice about the matter. Moreover, as
       an expiation, a spirit may be compelled to unite with
       the body of a particular child who, by its birth and the
       position it will have in the world, may become a means of
       punishment for that spirit.”
338.   If it just so happened that several spirits presented themselves
       to occupy the same body, how would the decision be made
       among them?
       “Many could very well request the same body, but in such
       cases it is God who decides which one is best suited to
       fulfill the mission for which the child is destined. But as I
       have already said, the spirit is designated before the instant
       in which it is to join the body.”
339.   Is the moment of incarnation accompanied by a state of
       confusion similar to the one following discarnation?
       “The confusion is much greater and especially much longer.
       At death, a spirit escapes slavery; at birth, it enters it.”


                                241

                          Part Two – Chapter VII


340.   Is the moment of incarnation a solemn one for the spirit? Does
       it accomplish it as something serious and important?
       “The spirit is like a traveler embarking on a dangerous voyage,
       not knowing if he will meet death on the waves ahead.”
         Travelers who set out on a voyage are aware that they will be exposed
         to dangers, but they do not know if they will run aground. The
         same applies to a spirit. It knows the kind of trials to which it will
         be submitted but does not know if it will fail.
         Just as the death of the body is a kind of rebirth for the spirit,
         reincarnation is a kind of death, or rather, a kind of exile and
         confinement. It leaves the spirit world for the corporeal world just as,
         after having been a human being, it leaves the corporeal world for the
         world of spirits. A spirit knows that it will reincarnate, just as a human
         being knows that he or she will die. Like humans, however, the spirit
         only becomes aware of it at the last moment, when the appointed time
         has arrived. Then, in that supreme moment, confusion takes hold of
         it, similar to someone in the throes of death. This confusion lasts until
         the new existence is firmly established. Thus, the commencement of
         reincarnation is a kind of death throes for the spirit.

341.   Is a spirit’s uncertainty as to the probability of successfully
       enduring the trials it will experience in life a cause of anxiety
       before its incarnation?
       “It is a cause of great anxiety because the trials of its existence
       will either delay or hasten its evolution, depending on
       whether they are borne well or badly.”
342.   At the moment of its reincarnation, is the spirit accompanied
       by spirit friends who come to assist with its departure from the
       spirit world, just as they come to meet it when it returns?
       “That depends on the sphere the spirit inhabits. If it
       belongs to a sphere in which affection reigns, spirits who
       love it accompany it up to the last moment, encouraging
       it and quite frequently following it during its lifetime.”


                                     242

                    The Return to Corporeal Life


343.   Are the spirit friends who follow us throughout life those who
       we sometimes see in our dreams, and who show their affection
       for us even though we do not recognize them physically?
       “Quite often they are. They come to visit you as you would
       visit a prisoner in jail.”


           The Joining of the Soul with
               the Body. Abortion
344.   At what moment does the soul actually join the body?
       “The union begins at conception but is only complete at
       the moment of birth. From the moment of conception,
       the spirit designated to inhabit a given body is connected
       to it by a fluidic tie, which gets tighter and tighter up
       to the instant the child is born. The newborn’s cries
       announce that it has entered the number of the living and
       the servants of God.”
345.   Is the union between the spirit and body definitive from
       the moment of conception? In other words, during this first
       stage could the spirit refuse to inhabit the body that has been
       designated for it?
       “The union is definitive in the sense that no other spirit can
       replace the one who has been designated for that particular
       body. However, since the ties that bind it are very tenuous
       and easy to break, they may actually be severed by the will
       of a spirit who recoils from the trial it has chosen. In that
       case, the child does not survive.”
346.   What happens to a spirit if the body it has chosen dies before
       birth?
       “It chooses another.”

                                243

                       Part Two – Chapter VII


       – What could be the usefulness of such premature deaths?
       “The imperfections of matter are frequently the cause of
       such deaths.”
347.   What usefulness can a spirit derive from incarnating into a
       body that dies a few days after birth?
       “Such a being does not yet have a sufficiently developed
       consciousness of its existence; the importance of its death
       is almost null. As we have already said, these cases are often
       meant as a trial for the parents.”
348.   Does a spirit know beforehand that the body it has chosen will
       have no chance of surviving?
       “It knows sometimes, but if it chooses it for that reason, it
       does so in order to avoid its upcoming trial.”
349.   When a particular incarnation fails for a spirit for any reason,
       is it immediately furnished with another existence?
       “Not always immediately. The spirit requires time to make
       another choice, unless an immediate reincarnation had
       been previously decided upon.”
350.   Once definitely united to the body of a child and therefore
       no longer able to withdraw, does a spirit sometimes regret the
       choice it has made?
       “Do you mean if as an incarnate spirit it might complain
       about its life, or if it would like to have another? Yes. Does
       it regret the choice it made? No, because it does not even
       remember having made the choice in the first place. Once
       incarnate, a spirit cannot regret a choice of which it has no
       awareness, but it may find the burden to be too heavy, and
       if it thinks the burden is beyond its strength to endure, it
       may resort to suicide.”



                                244

                    The Return to Corporeal Life


351.   In the interval between conception and birth, do spirits enjoy
       all their faculties?
       “More so or less so, depending on the phase of gestation
       because during that time they are not yet fully incarnated;
       they are only attached to the body. At the moment of
       conception, confusion begins to envelop the spirit and
       it is thereby warned that the time has come to start a
       new existence. This confusion increases until the time of
       birth. In the meantime, its state is more or less that of
       an incarnate spirit during sleep. As the moment of birth
       approaches, its ideas are erased, as well as its memory of
       the past, which it is no longer conscious of once it returns
       to life on the earth. But this memory returns little by little
       when it reenters the spirit state.”
352.   At the moment of birth, do spirits immediately recover the
       fullness of their faculties?
       “No, the faculties develop gradually with the organs.
       Spirits find themselves in a new existence and must learn
       to use their bodily instruments. Their ideas return little by
       little, like those of individuals who wake up from sleep to
       find themselves in a different situation than the one they
       were in the day before.”
353.   Since the union of a spirit with its body is not complete and
       definitely consummated until after birth, can the fetus be
       considered as having a soul?
       “The spirit who must animate it exists outside of it, so
       to speak. Strictly speaking, the fetus has no soul since
       the current incarnation is only in the process of being
       accomplished. Nevertheless, the fetus is linked to the soul
       that it will have.”
354.   How can intra-uterine life be explained?


                                245

                               Part Two – Chapter VII


          “It is like a germinating plant. The fetus lives a corporeal
          animal-like life. As a fetus, human beings already have
          within themselves a vegeto-animal47 life, which they
          complete at birth with a spiritual life.”
355.      As medical science has pointed out, there are infants who,
          even in their mother’s womb, have no possibility of surviving.
          For what purpose does this occur?
          “This is a common occurrence that God permits as a trial,
          either for the parents or the spirit appointed to animate
          the child.”
356.      Are there stillborn infants who were not meant for a spirit to
          incarnate in them in the first place?
          “Yes, there are some who never had a spirit destined for
          their bodies – nothing would have been accomplished
          in them. It is solely for the parents that such a child is
          delivered.”
          – Can a being of such a nature be carried to term?
          “Yes, sometimes, but then it does not survive.”
          – Then every child that survives necessarily has a spirit
          incarnated in it?
          “Of course; what would it be without a spirit? It would
          not be a human being.”
357.      What are the consequences of abortion for a spirit?
          “Its existence is nullified and must be commenced again.”
358.      Is artificial abortion a crime regardless of the time of conception?
          “A crime is always committed when the law of God is
          transgressed. The mother or any other person involved always

       commits a crime upon taking the life of a child before its
       birth because it prevents a soul from experiencing the trials for
       which the unborn’s body was to have been the instrument.”
359.   In cases where the life of the mother would be endangered
       by the birth of the child, is it a crime to sacrifice the child in
       order to save the mother?
       “It is better to sacrifice the being who does not yet exist
       than the being who already exists.”
360.   Is it rational to treat the fetus with the same respect as the
       body of a child who has already survived?
       “You should see the will of God and the divine handiwork
       in everything, and not treat lightly the things you ought to
       respect. Why not respect all the works of creation, which
       are sometimes incomplete by the will of the Creator?
       Everything follows according to God’s designs and no one
       is called upon to judge them.”


            The Moral and Intellectual
             Faculties of Humankind
361.   Where do a person’s good or evil moral qualities come from?
       “They reflect the qualities of the incarnate spirit. The
       purer the spirit, the more the person is inclined toward
       the good.”
       – So a moral person is the incarnation of a good spirit and a
       cruel person that of an evil spirit?
       “Yes, but it would be better to say an imperfect spirit;
       otherwise, one might believe in spirits who will always
       remain evil – those you call demons.”


                                 247

                        Part Two – Chapter VII


362.   What is the character of the individuals in whom frivolous
       and foolish spirits are incarnated?
       “They are thoughtless, cunning, and sometimes malicious
       beings.”
363.   Do spirits possess any passions that do not belong to humankind?
       “No; otherwise, they would have passed them on to you.”
364.   Is it one and the same spirit who gives an individual his or her
       moral and intellectual qualities?
       “Certainly it is one and the same, and such qualities will
       depend on the degree of the spirit’s evolution. Individuals
       do not have two spirits within them.”
365.   Why are the most intelligent individuals, who display a highly
       evolved spirit incarnated in them, sometimes and at the same
       time extremely cruel?
       “It is because the incarnate spirit is not sufficiently purified;
       also, because the person yields to the influence of other spirits
       who are even worse. A spirit progresses in an imperceptible
       ascending forward progression, but this progress is not
       accomplished simultaneously in all senses. During one period a
       spirit may advance in knowledge; during another, in morality.”
366.   What about the opinion according to which the various moral and
       intellectual qualities of humans are the product of many different
       spirits incarnate in them, each possessing a special aptitude?
       “If you reflect on it, you will realize how absurd that is. A
       spirit must possess all aptitudes and in order to progress, it
       needs a unified will. If a person were a collection of spirits,
       this unified will would not exist. He or she would possess no
       individuality, because at death all those spirits would be like
       a flock of birds escaping from a cage. People often complain
       that they do not understand certain things, but it is interesting


                                 248

                      The Return to Corporeal Life


       to notice how they multiply their problems when they have a
       very simple and natural explanation right there in their own
       hands. This notion is another example of taking the effect for
       the cause; it attributes to the human being what the pagans
       attributed to God. They believed in as many gods as there
       were phenomena in the universe. However, even among
       them sensible persons saw nothing more in those phenomena
       than effects having as their cause a sole God.”
         The physical and moral realms both offer us numerous points of
         comparison in this respect. Humankind believed in the multiplicity
         of matter as long as examining it was confined to the appearance of
         phenomena. Nowadays, we understand that such varied phenomena
         might very well be no more than modifications of a single elementary
         matter. The various qualities and faculties are manifestations of the
         same cause, which is the soul or incarnate spirit, and not several
         souls – like the different sounds of an organ are the result of the same
         kind of air, and not of as many types of air as there are sounds. The
         theory in question would mean that when a person loses or acquires
         certain aptitudes or tendencies, it indicates that certain spirits had
         left the person or that others had arrived, which would make him or
         her into a multiple being without individuality, and consequently,
         without responsibility. This theory, moreover, is contradicted by the
         numerous examples of manifestations in which spirits prove their
         personality and their identity.



         The Influence of the Organism
367.   Upon joining the body, does a spirit identify itself with matter?
       “Matter is no more than the spirit’s envelope, as clothing
       is the body’s envelope. Upon joining the body, a spirit
       preserves the attributes of its spirit nature.”
368.   Does a spirit exercise its faculties with full liberty after its
       union with a body?

                                    249

                        Part Two – Chapter VII


       “The exercise of its faculties depends on the organs
       serving as their instruments. They are weakened by the
       density of matter.”
       – Then accordingly, would the material envelope be an
       obstacle to the free manifestation of the spirit’s faculties, like
       an opaque glass is an obstacle to the free emission of light?
       “Yes, and exceedingly opaque.”
         One may further compare the action of the body’s matter upon a
         spirit to that of sludgy water, which hinders the free movement of
         an object immersed in it.

369.   Is the free exercise of the soul’s faculties subordinate to the
       development of the bodily organs?
       “The organs are the instruments for the manifestation of the
       soul’s faculties. This manifestation depends on the degree of
       the respective organs’ development, just as the excellence of
       a piece of work depends on the excellence of the tool.”
370.   Could one infer from the influence of the organs a connection
       between the development of the cerebral structure and the
       moral and intellectual faculties?
       “Do not confuse the effect with the cause. The spirit
       always possesses the faculties that are proper for it. Thus,
       it is not the organs that give it its faculties, but rather the
       faculties that stimulate the development of the organs.”
       – According to this view, does the diversity of aptitudes among
       individuals stem solely from the condition of their spirit?
       “Solely is not the exact term. The qualities of the spirit,
       who may be more advanced or less so, are the basis for
       this diversity; however, we must take into account the
       influence of matter because it hinders to a greater or lesser
       degree the exercising of these faculties.”


                                  250

                               The Return to Corporeal Life


                When the spirit incarnates, it brings certain predispositions with it, and
                if we accept the idea that there is a corresponding area in the brain for
                each one of them, then the development of these areas will be seen as
                an effect and not a cause. If the faculties had their origins in the organs
                themselves, humans would be machines without free will and without
                any responsibility for their actions. We would have to accept the fact
                that the greatest geniuses – scientists, poets, artists – owe their talents to
                chance, which has given them a special brain structure. Consequently,
                without this structure, they would not be geniuses; the least simpleton
                could have been a Newton, a Virgil or a Raphael if he had been
                provided with a certain brain structure. This assumption becomes
                even more absurd when applied to moral qualities. Thus, according to
                this theory, if Saint Vincent de Paul had been gifted by nature with a
                particular brain structure, he might have been a scoundrel, whereas the
                greatest scoundrel would only lack a certain brain structure in order to
                be someone like Saint Vincent de Paul. On the other hand, if we accept
                the idea that such special structures, if they exist, are effects developed
                by exercising the faculties – like the muscles by moving them – then
                nothing seems unreasonable. Let us make a trivial comparison, albeit
                a truthful one. By certain facial traits you recognize that a person is
                addicted to alcohol. Do these traits make the person an alcoholic or is it
                alcoholism that produces the traits? Therefore, one may safely state that
                the organs receive the imprint of the faculties.


                 Mental Impairment48. Insanity
371.         Is there any basis for the opinion that mentally impaired
             individuals have a soul of a little-evolved nature?
 		The 1857 original contained the heading “Idiotisme”, for which there are several translations
48

  in modern English: Idiocy: Idiot: A person of profound mental retardation having a mental
  age below three years, and generally unable to learn connected speech or guard against
  common dangers. The term belongs to a classification system no longer in use and is now
  considered offensive” (American Heritage College Dictionary,1979). The definition used
  most often in the U.S. is from the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR).
  According to the AAMR, mental retardation is a disability that occurs before age 18. It is
  characterized by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior as
  expressed in conceptual, social and practical adaptive skills (AAMR, 2002).
     Herein, the term will be defined as mental impairment – Tr.



                                              251

                        Part Two – Chapter VII


       “No. They have a human soul who is frequently more
       intelligent than you might think, and who suffers immensely
       from the insufficiency of its means to communicate – as a
       mute suffers from the inability to speak.”
372.   What is the aim of Providence in creating unfortunate beings
       like the mentally impaired?
       “The spirits who dwell in such bodies are expiating past
       wrongs. They suffer from their constraints and from
       the impossibility of expressing themselves because of
       undeveloped or defective brains.”
       – Then is it inaccurate to say that organs do not exercise any
       influence on the faculties?
       “We have never said that organs have no influence at
       all; rather, they exercise a very great influence on the
       manifestation of the faculties, but they themselves do
       not produce the faculties – that is the difference. A good
       musician will not make good music with a bad instrument,
       but that does not mean he or she is not a good musician.”
        It is necessary to distinguish between the normal state and the
        pathological state. In the normal state, mental ability may overcome
        material obstacles. However, there are cases where matter offers so
        much resistance that the manifestations are hindered or distorted,
        as is the case with mental impairment and insanity. These are
        pathological cases, and in such states the soul is not in possession
        of its full reasoning ability, which is why human law exempts such
        persons from responsibility for their acts.

373.   What could possibly be the merit in the existence of beings
       who, like the mentally impaired, can do neither good nor evil,
       and therefore cannot progress?
       “It is an expiation imposed for their having abused certain
       faculties in a former life; it is a temporary pause.”


                                  252

                      The Return to Corporeal Life


       – So the body of a mentally impaired person may confine
       a spirit who perhaps animated the body of a genius in a
       preceding existence?
       “Yes, genius sometimes becomes a curse when it is abused.”
         Moral superiority does not always imply intellectual superiority,
         and the greatest geniuses may have much to expiate. Consequently,
         they often live a present existence that is inferior when compared
         to those they have already lived – a cause of great suffering. The
         impediments that these spirits experience when they try to express
         themselves are for them like chains that fetter the movements of
         an active person. One could say that the mentally impaired are
         disabled in the brain, as others are disabled in their limbs or eyes.

374.   In the spirit state, are the mentally impaired conscious of their
       mental state?
       “Yes, quite often. They understand that the chains
       hindering their development are a trial and an expiation.”
375.   What is the situation of the spirit in the state of insanity?
       “When freed from the body, the spirit receives impressions
       directly, and directly exerts its action upon matter. Once
       incarnated, however, it finds itself in completely different
       conditions and in need of acting with the help of special
       organs. If one part or a group of these organs is altered, the
       spirit’s actions are interrupted – defective eyes cause blindness;
       defective ears cause deafness, etc. Now imagine that the
       organ presiding over the manifestations of intelligence and
       will is partially or entirely damaged or modified and you
       will easily understand that the use of such an incomplete
       or distorted organ will result in an affliction that the spirit
       is fully aware of, but whose course it is powerless to deter.”
       – Then it is always the body and not the spirit that is
       dysfunctional?


                                   253

                       Part Two – Chapter VII


       “Yes, but you must not lose sight of the fact that just as a
       spirit acts upon matter, matter reacts upon the spirit to a
       certain degree; hence, a spirit may find itself momentarily
       controlled by the alteration of its organs through which it
       manifests and receives various impressions. It may happen
       that, with time, and after the insanity has lasted quite a
       while, the repetition of the same acts end up exerting on
       the spirit an influence from which it will not be freed until
       its complete separation from every material effect.”
376.   What is the reason for insanity sometimes leading to suicide?
       “The spirit suffers immensely from its constraints and
       from the powerlessness to freely manifest itself. Thus, it
       seeks a way to break its ties in death.”
377.   After death, does the spirit of a mentally impaired person
       continue to feel the derangement of its faculties?
       “It may feel it for quite some time until it is completely
       disconnected from matter, like a person who, upon
       awakening, continues to feel the confusion into which
       sleep has immersed him or her.”
378.   How is it possible for the impairment of the brain to react
       upon the spirit after death?
       “It is a remembrance. A weight bears down upon the
       spirit, and since it was not aware of everything that took
       place during its insanity, it requires some time to be able
       to understand its current state. That is why the longer
       insanity lasts during life, the longer the affliction and
       the constraint will last after death. Disconnected from
       the body, the spirit continues to feel the impression of its
       bonds for some time thereafter.”

                      The Return to Corporeal Life


                           Childhood
379.   Is the spirit who animates the body of a child as developed as
       the spirit of an adult?
       “Maybe more so if it is more evolved. Only its imperfect
       organs keep it from fully manifesting itself. It must act
       according to the instrument that serves it.”
380.   In a very young child, and despite the obstacle that the
       imperfection of its organs imposes on its ability to freely
       manifest itself, does the spirit think as a child or as an adult?
       “While a child, it is natural that the as-yet undeveloped
       organ of intelligence cannot provide it with all the intuition
       of an adult. Its intelligence is therefore quite limited until
       age matures its reason. The confusion accompanying
       incarnation does not cease suddenly at birth, but only
       dissipates gradually with the development of the organs.”
         An observation supports this response: the dreams of a child do not
         have the character of the dreams of an adult. Their object is almost
         always childish, which is an indication of the nature of the spirit’s
         preoccupations.

381.   With the death of the child, does the spirit immediately regain
       its former vigor?
       “It should, since it has been disencumbered from its physical
       envelope. Nevertheless, it does not regain its former lucidity
       until the separation is complete, that is, until there is no
       connection between the spirit and the body at all.”
382.   Does the incarnate spirit suffer from the constraint imposed
       by the imperfection of its organs during childhood?
       “No. Childhood is a necessity. It is natural and corresponds
       to the designs of Providence. It is a time of repose for the spirit.”


                                   255

                       Part Two – Chapter VII


383.   What is the usefulness of a spirit having to go through
       childhood?
       “A spirit incarnates in order to perfect itself. During
       childhood it is more accessible to the impressions it receives,
       and which may assist in its progress. Persons in charge of its
       education should contribute towards this goal.”
384.   Why are a child’s first expressions those of crying?
       “To incite the mother’s interest and ensure the care it
       needs. Don’t you understand that if it only expressed joy
       while still unable to speak, few would be concerned about
       its needs? Therefore, you ought to admire the wisdom of
       Providence in everything.”
385.   What is the reason for the change that occurs in its character
       at a certain age, particularly upon leaving adolescence? Is it
       the spirit that changes?
       “It is because the spirit recaptures its true nature and
       reveals who it really was prior to its present incarnation.
       You do not know the secrets that children conceal behind
       their innocence. You do not know what they are, what
       they have been or what they will be; nevertheless, you love
       and cherish them as though they were a part of you. This
       happens to such a degree that the love of a mother for
       her child is reputed to be the greatest love that one being
       may have for another. Why do even strangers feel sweet
       affection and display tender benevolence toward a child?
       Do you know? No? Well, I will explain it to you.
       “Children are beings whom God has sent into a new
       existence. So that God is not accused of excessive severity,
       God gives them all the appearances of innocence. Even
       in children of an evil nature, their misdeeds are covered
       up because they are unaware of the quality of their acts.


                                 256

             The Return to Corporeal Life


However, this innocence does not truly reflect their state
of advancement in relation to what they previously were.
In reality, it is a picture of what they ought to be, and if
they are not, the blame falls on them alone.
“Nevertheless, it is not merely for the children’s sake
that God gives them such an appearance; it is also and
especially for their parents, whose love is necessary in their
fragility. Such love would be extraordinarily weakened
if the parents were faced with a quarrelsome and bad-
tempered character. On the other hand, supposing their
children to be good and gentle, parents give them all their
affection and surround them with the tenderest care.
However, when children no longer need the protection
and assistance that has been given to them for fifteen or
twenty years, their true and individual character emerges
in all its nakedness. Their character remains good if it was
fundamentally good in the first place, but it will always
display nuances that were hidden during early childhood.
“You can see that God’s ways are always the best, and that
when one has a pure heart, they are easily explained.
“In fact, ponder the possibility that the spirit of the child
who is born among you may have come from a world on
which it had acquired altogether different habits. How
would you want this new being to remain in your midst
with passions so diverse from yours, inclinations and tastes
entirely opposite to yours? How would you want it to
incorporate itself into your environment except in the way
God wanted it to, that is, after having experienced the sieve
of childhood? In this phase are mixed all the thoughts, all
the characteristics and all the varieties of beings generated
by that multitude of worlds on which individuals develop.
Upon dying, you yourselves will also be in a sort of

                         257

                              Part Two – Chapter VII


          childhood in the midst of new family members. In your
          new non-terrestrial existence, you will be ignorant of the
          habits, the customs and the forms of relationships of that
          world, and you will have difficulty in managing a language
          you are not used to speaking – a language more alive than
          your thought is today. (See no. 319)
          “Childhood provides yet another purpose: spirits only enter
          corporeal life in order to improve and purify themselves.
          The fragility of the early years renders them flexible and
          accessible to the counsels of experience and to those who
          should aid their progress. That is the time when one can
          best reform their character and curb their evil tendencies.
          Such is the duty that God entrusts to parents, a sacred
          mission for which they will have to answer.
          “Consequently, childhood is not only useful, necessary and
          indispensable, but it is also the natural result of the laws
          that God has established, and which govern the universe.”


       Earthly Sympathies49 and Antipathies
386.      Could two individuals who have already known and loved
          each other meet in another corporeal existence and recognize
          each other?
          “Recognize each other, no; feel attracted to each other,
          yes. Frequently, intimate connections founded on sincere
          affection arise from no other cause. Two individuals are
          drawn together by apparently fortuitous circumstances,
          but it is actually the result of the attraction of two spirits
          who have been searching for each other amidst the crowds.”

       – Wouldn’t they find great pleasure in being able to recognize
       each other?
       “Not always. The memory of past lives might hold greater
       disadvantages than you suppose. After death, they will
       recognize each other and will remember the time they
       spent together.” (See no. 392)
387.   Is sympathy always the result of their having known each
       other previously?
       “No. Two spirits who have affinities naturally search for
       each other without their having been previously acquainted
       as incarnates.”
388.   Wouldn’t the encounters which sometimes occur between
       certain persons, and which are attributed to chance, be the
       effect of a kind of sympathetic relationship?
       “Among thinking beings there are connections that you
       do not yet know anything about. Magnetism is at the core
       of this science, which you will later comprehend better.”
389.   Where does the instinctive repulsion come from when certain
       individuals meet each other for the first time?
       “They are antipathetic spirits who perceive and recognize
       each other without ever having spoken to each other.”
390.   Is instinctive antipathy always a sign of an evil nature?
       “Two spirits are not necessarily evil just because they
       are not sympathetic. Antipathy may originate from a
       dissimilarity in their way of thinking. As they evolve,
       however, these shades of dissimilarity are erased and the
       antipathy disappears.”
391.   Does the antipathy between two individuals arise first in the
       one whose spirit is worse or in the other whose spirit is better?


                                 259

                         Part Two – Chapter VII


       “It arises in both, but the causes and effects are different.
       An evil spirit feels antipathy towards anyone who may be
       able to judge and unmask it. Upon seeing a person for the
       first time, it perceives that that person will disapprove of
       it. Its dislike then changes into hatred and envy, which
       inspire it with the desire to do evil. The good spirit, on the
       other hand, is repulsed by the evil one because it knows it
       will not be understood by the other and that neither shares
       the same sentiments. However, aware of its higher moral
       principles, it feels neither hatred nor jealousy toward the
       other: it is content to simply avoid and pity it.”


               Forgetfulness of the Past
392.   Why does the incarnate spirit lose the memory of its past?
       “Human beings cannot and must not know everything.
       God, out of divine wisdom, wills it to be this way. Without
       the veil that hides certain things from them, they would be
       dazzled, like one who passes suddenly from the darkness
       into the light. By forgetting their past, they are more fully
       themselves in the present.”
393.   How can individuals be responsible for their deeds and redeem their
       wrongs if they cannot remember them? How can they profit from
       the experience acquired in lives that have fallen into forgottenness?
       We could understand that life’s tribulations might be a lesson for
       them if they could remember what had caused them in the first
       place, but since they do not remember them at all, each existence is
       as if it were the first, and it is thus that they are always having to
       start over. How can this be reconciled with the justice of God?
       “With each new existence, spirits gain more intelligence and
       can better distinguish between good and evil. Where would


                                   260

                     The Return to Corporeal Life


       their merit be if they remembered their entire past? When
       spirits enter their life of origin (the spirit life), their entire
       previous life unfolds before them. They see the wrongs they
       committed, and which are the cause of their suffering, as
       well as what would have kept them from committing them
       in the first place. They understand the justice of the position
       assigned to them, and they thus desire a new existence that
       can redeem the one that has elapsed. They seek trials similar
       to those they have already experienced, or struggles they
       believe will be appropriate for their advancement. They ask
       spirits who are of a higher order to help them in the new
       task that they are about to undertake, for they know that the
       spirit who will be given to them as their guide in that new
       existence will endeavor to enable them to repair their wrongs
       of the past by giving them a sort of intuition about them.
       This same intuition is the thought, the wrongful desire,
       which frequently assaults you, and which you instinctively
       resist, most of the time attributing your resistance to the
       principles you have received from your parents. However, it
       is the voice of conscience speaking to you and this voice is a
       memory of the past, a voice that warns you not to fall into
       the errors you committed previously. In that new existence,
       if a spirit endures its trials with courage and resists them,
       it evolves and will ascend in the spirits’ hierarchy when it
       returns to be among them.”
         If during our corporeal life we do not have a precise memory of
         what we were and of what good or evil we did in our previous
         lifetimes, we nevertheless have an intuition of them. Hence, our
         instinctive tendencies are a reminiscence of our past, about which
         our conscience – which represents the desire we have conceived to
         no longer commit the same wrongs – warns us that we must resist.

394.   On worlds more advanced than ours, where beings are not
       subject to all our physical needs and infirmities, do they


                                  261

                  Part Two – Chapter VII


understand that they are happier than we are? Happiness,
in general, is relative; we feel it by comparing it with a less
happy state. In sum, some of those worlds, though better than
ours, have not yet reached the state of perfection, and their
inhabitants must have their own annoyances. Even though
the wealthy among us do not suffer the anxieties of material
needs like the poor, they are no less subject to the same types
of tribulations that embitter their lives. Thus, I would ask
whether the inhabitants of those worlds in their own situations
feel as unhappy as we do, and whether they also complain
about their fate since they do not have the memory of a less
evolved existence for comparison.
“Two different answers apply to this question. There are
worlds among those you are speaking about, on which the
inhabitants have a clear and exact memory of their past
lives. You should understand that these can and do know
how to appreciate the happiness that God permits them to
enjoy. However, there are other worlds whose inhabitants,
situated, as you say, in better conditions than yours, are
no less subject to great annoyances, and even misfortunes.
They do not appreciate their happiness because they do
not remember an even unhappier state. Nevertheless, if
they do not appreciate it as incarnates, they will as spirits.”
  In the forgetfulness of past existences, especially when they were
  painful, is there not something providential where the divine
  wisdom is revealed? It is on the more highly evolved worlds, when
  the memory of unhappy lives is nothing more than a bad dream,
  that the memory of such lives resurfaces. On less evolved worlds,
  however, would present misfortunes not be increased by the
  memory of everything that had been endured in the past? Therefore,
  we conclude that everything that God has made is well-made, and
  that it is not our place to criticize the divine works and say how God
  ought to have regulated the universe.



                            262

                      The Return to Corporeal Life


         The remembrance of our former personalities would entail serious
         inconveniences. In certain cases, it could cause us a great deal of
         humiliation; in others, it could exalt our pride and so hinder our
         free will. God has given us just what is necessary and sufficient for
         us to improve ourselves: the voice of conscience and our instinctive
         tendencies keeping us from what could harm us. We would further
         add that if we had the remembrance of our own former personal
         acts, we would also be able to remember those of other people, and
         such knowledge could have the most unpleasant effects on our social
         relationships. Since we do not always have a good reason for being
         proud of our past, it is almost always a blessing for a veil to have been
         thrown over it. This concurs perfectly with the doctrine of the Spirits
         regarding worlds that are more evolved than ours. On those worlds,
         where nothing reigns except the good, there is nothing painful about
         remembering the past. That is why previous lifetimes are frequently
         remembered as easily as we remember what we did yesterday. As
         for the sojourn that one may have had on less evolved worlds, the
         memory of it is nothing more than a bad dream, as we have stated.

395.   Can we obtain any revelations about our former lives?
       “Not always. Nevertheless, many know who they were
       and what they did. If they were permitted to speak openly,
       they would make curious revelations about the past.”
396.   Some persons believe they have a vague memory of an unknown
       past. It appears as a fleeting image of a dream, which in vain
       they try to retain. Wouldn’t this belief simply be an illusion?
       “It is sometimes real, but much more often it is an illusion
       to be guarded against; it could simply be the effect of an
       over-excited imagination.”
397.   In corporeal existences of a more evolved nature than ours, is
       the memory of previous lives more precise?
       “Yes, as the body becomes less material, they become easier
       to remember. The memory of the past is clearer for those
       who inhabit worlds of a higher order.”

                                     263

                       Part Two – Chapter VII


398.   Since people’s instinctive tendencies are a reminiscence of their
       past, then by studying those tendencies can they know about
       the wrongs they committed?
       “Undoubtedly, to a certain point; however, it is necessary
       to take into account the improvement that may have taken
       place in the spirit and the resolutions it made in its errant
       state. Their present existence could in fact be much better
       than the preceding one.”
       – Could it be worse? In other words, could persons commit
       wrongs in their present existence, which they had not
       committed in the preceding one?
       “That depends on their advancement. If they do not
       yet know how to resist trials, they could be drawn to
       commit new wrongs as a consequence of the position
       they themselves have chosen. But such wrongs indicate a
       stationary state rather than a regressive one, because spirits
       may advance or remain stationary; they do not regress.”
399.   Since the tribulations of corporeal life are at the same time
       expiations for past wrongs and trials for the future, does it
       follow that, from the nature of these tribulations, we may
       deduce the kind of preceding existence we lived?
       “Very frequently, because individuals are punished for
       their particular sins. Nevertheless, we cannot make this
       an absolute rule. The instinctive tendencies are a more
       certain indication because the trials that a spirit undergoes
       refer as much to the future as to the past.”
         When the end that Providence has marked for their errant life
         has arrived, spirits choose for themselves the trials to which
         they desire to submit themselves, and which will hasten their
         advancement; that is, the kind of existence they believe most
         appropriate for furnishing them with the means to evolve, and
         such trials are always related to the wrongs they must expiate.


                                 264

              The Return to Corporeal Life


If they triumph over them, they advance; if they succumb, they
have to start over.
Spirits always enjoy their free will. It is in virtue of this freedom that
in the spirit state they choose the trials of their upcoming corporeal
life, and in the incarnate state they deliberate over what they will or
will not do, choosing between good and evil. Denying humans their
free will would reduce them to the condition of a machine.
Integrated into corporeal life, spirits momentarily lose the
remembrance of their former lives, as though a veil hid them.
Nevertheless, they sometimes have a vague awareness of them, and
they may even be revealed under certain circumstances. However,
this does not happen except by the will of the high order spirits,
who may allow it to occur spontaneously for some useful purpose
but never to satisfy vain curiosity.
Of course, future existences cannot be revealed in any case since
they depend both on the manner in which the present existence is
completed and the later choice of the spirit.
Forgetfulness of wrongs that were committed is not an obstacle
to spirits’ improvement because, even though they do not have a
precise memory of them, the knowledge they had of them during
the errant state, in addition to the desire they conceived at that
time to repair them, guide them through their intuition and inspire
them with the thought of resisting evil. This thought is the voice of
conscience, and it is seconded by spirits who will assist them if they
heed their good suggestions.
Even though people do not know the acts they committed in
their previous lives, they can nonetheless always know the kind
of wrongs for which they became guilty and what their dominant
characteristics were. They only have to study themselves in the
present and they will be able to discern what they were in the past,
not by what they are per se but by their tendencies.
The tribulations of corporeal life are at the same time expiations for
past wrongs and trials for the future. They purify and elevate us if
we endure them with resignation and without complaint.



                            265

                Part Two – Chapter VII


The nature of the trials and tribulations we undergo may also
enlighten us about what we were and what we did, as in this world
we judge the acts of a criminal by the punishment the law inflicts
on him or her. Thus, those who were proud will be punished by the
humiliation of a subaltern position; the self-indulgent and greedy by
poverty; those who were harsh toward others by the harsh treatment
they themselves will suffer; the tyrant by slavery; the bad son by the
ingratitude of his own children; the lazy by forced labor, etc.

                   Sleep and Dreams
400.   Does an incarnate spirit willingly stay in its corporeal
       envelope?
       “That is like asking if a prisoner is happy being under lock
       and key. An incarnate spirit constantly aspires to freedom.
       The denser the envelope, the more it wants to be free of it.”
401.   During sleep does the soul rest like the body?
       “No, a spirit never remains inactive. During sleep, the bonds
       that join it to the body are loosened, and since the body does
       not need it while sleeping, the spirit travels through space
       and enters into a more direct relationship with other spirits.”


                                267

                      Part Two – Chapter VIII


402.   How can we confirm the fact that a spirit is free during sleep?
       “By dreams. While the body rests, the spirit enjoys more
       of its faculties than in the waking state. It remembers the
       past and sometimes foresees the future. It acquires more
       power and can communicate with other spirits whether on
       this world or another. You frequently say, ‘I had a bizarre
       dream, a horrible dream, but there is no likelihood of it
       being true.’ You are mistaken. It is almost always a memory
       of places and things which you have seen, or which you
       will see in another existence or on another occasion. Since
       the body is dormant, the spirit tries to break its chains in
       order to probe into the past and future.
       “Poor human beings! You know so little about the most
       ordinary phenomena of life! You believe you are very wise,
       yet the most ordinary things puzzle you to no end. To the
       question of all children, ‘What do we do when we sleep?
       What are dreams?’ you remain without an answer.
       “Sleep partially frees the soul from the body. When
       humans sleep, they momentarily find themselves in the
       state which they will be in permanently after death. Spirits
       who quickly free themselves from matter upon death had
       intelligent dreams during earthly life. Such spirits, while
       their body is sleeping, rejoin the company of those who
       are more evolved; they travel with, converse with and learn
       from them. They even work on projects that they find
       completed upon dying. From these facts you should once
       more learn not to fear death, because you die daily – as a
       saint once stated.
       “This applies only to more highly evolved spirits; however,
       the mass of spirits, who at death must remain in a state of
       confusion for some time – that uncertainty of which we


                                268

            The Emancipation of the Soul


have already spoken to you – either go to worlds even less
evolved than earth, where former affections call to them or
where they seek out pleasures that are perhaps even baser
than those they indulge in here. They go to take in doctrines
even viler, more ignoble and more noxious than those
they profess among you. What engenders sympathies on
earth is nothing other than the fact that upon awakening,
they feel linked to the hearts of those with whom they
have just spent eight or nine hours of happiness or
pleasure. Moreover, the insuperable antipathies they feel
at the bottom of our heart for certain individuals may be
explained by the fact that they have a consciousness that is
different from their own; they recognize these individual
without having ever seen them before. It is furthermore
what explains people’s indifference when they do not seek
to make new friends – they know that those who love and
cherish them are elsewhere. In a word, sleep has more
influence than you think on your life.
“During sleep, incarnate spirits are always in touch with
the spirit world, and that is what leads high order spirits,
without too much aversion, to consent to incarnate
among you. During their contact with earthly vices, God
grants them the freedom to re-strengthen themselves
during sleep at the source of the good in order not to fail
in their commitment to instruct others. Sleep is the door
that God opens to them for contacting their friends in
heaven. It is their break after work while they await the
great deliverance, the final liberation that must restore
them to their true environment.
“A dream is the memory of what your spirit has seen during
sleep. However, notice that you do not always dream,
because you do not always remember what you have seen,


                        269

                 Part Two – Chapter VIII


or everything that you have seen. This happens because
your soul is still under development, so that frequently
you retain nothing more than the confused memory
that accompanies your departure and your return, which
is mixed in with the memory of what you have done or
what concerns you have had while awake. Otherwise, how
do you explain those absurd dreams that both the wisest
and the simplest individuals endure? Evil spirits also use
dreams to torment weak and cowardly souls.
“Furthermore, you will soon see another type of dreaming
develop; a type as ancient as the kind you already know
about but of which you are ignorant. It is the dream of
Joan of Arc, the dream of Jacob, the dream of the Jewish
prophets and certain Indian seers: this sort of dream is
the remembrance of the soul entirely disengaged from the
body, the memory of that other life of which I have just
spoken to you.
“Try hard to distinguish between these two types of dreams
among those that you remember; unless you do, you will
fall into contradictions and errors that could be disastrous
for your faith.”
 Dreams are a product of the emancipation of the soul, who becomes
 more independent through the suspension of active life and
 relationships. This results in a sort of fuzzy clairvoyance, which extends
 to the most distant places or to those that have never been seen, and
 sometimes even to other worlds. It also results in the remembrance
 of events that have taken place in our present existence or in previous
 ones. The singularity of the images referring to what is occurring or
 has occurred on unknown worlds, mixed together with the images of
 the present world, form those bizarre and confused medleys that seem
 to have neither meaning nor connection.
 The incoherence of dreams is further explained by the gaps resulting
 from the incomplete memory of what has appeared to us during


                             270

                    The Emancipation of the Soul


        the dream, much like a narrative from which sentences or parts of
        sentences have been accidentally omitted; if the remaining fragments
        were joined together, they would lose all rational meaning.

403.   Why don’t we always remember our dreams?
       “During what you call sleep, you only experience the repose
       of the body because the spirit is always in motion. During
       sleep, it recovers a little of its freedom and communicates
       with those who are dear to it either on this world or on
       others. But since the body is composed of heavy and
       dense matter, it is difficult for it to retain the impressions
       received by the spirit because the spirit did not receive
       them through the body’s organs in the first place.”
404.   What should we think about the various meanings attributed
       to dreams?
       “Dreams are not true in the sense that fortune-tellers, for
       example, understand them, for it is absurd to believe that
       dreaming about one matter necessarily foretells another.
       They are true in the sense that they present real images to
       the spirit, but these images often have no relation to what
       occurs in its corporeal life. Furthermore, as we have stated,
       many times they are a memory of the past. Lastly, they
       may also sometimes be a presentiment of the future if God
       allows it, or a vision of what is occurring at the moment
       in another place to which the soul has gone. Don’t you
       have numerous examples of persons who appear in dreams
       to warn relatives and friends about what is happening to
       them? What are these apparitions if not the soul or spirit
       of these persons communicating with you? When you
       confirm that what you have seen has really occurred, isn’t
       it evidence that the imagination has had nothing to do
       with it, especially if the event was absolutely not in your
       thought while you were awake?”


                                  271

                        Part Two – Chapter VIII


405.   Frequently, things are seen in dreams that appear to be
       presentiments about matters that end up not occurring. Where
       do these come from?
       “They may occur for the spirit if not for the body, which
       means that the spirit sees what it desires because it goes
       looking for it. You must not forget that during sleep the
       soul is always more or less under the influence of matter,
       and consequently it is never completely free from terrestrial
       ideas. Therefore, the concerns of wakefulness may give
       what you see the appearance of what you desire or what
       you fear. This is really what can be called a trick of the
       imagination. When you are strongly preoccupied with an
       idea, you connect it to everything you see.”
406.   When we see living persons perfectly known to us doing things
       in a dream which they would absolutely never think of doing
       in real life, isn’t it pure imagination?
       “Which they would absolutely never think about? How
       do you know that? Their spirit may come to visit yours,
       as yours may visit theirs, without your always knowing
       what they are thinking about. Besides, according to your
       desires, you frequently apply to individuals familiar to you
       what occurred or is occurring in other existences.”
407.   Is complete sleep necessary for the emancipation of the spirit?
       “No. The spirit recovers its freedom whenever the senses
       become sluggish. It takes advantage of every moment of
       respite that the body offers it to emancipate itself. As
       soon as there is a prostration of the vital forces, the spirit
       disengages itself; the weaker the body is, the freer the
       spirit will be.”
         Thus, a nap or a simple dulling of the senses often presents the same
         images as dreaming does.

                    The Emancipation of the Soul


408.   Sometimes it seems to us that we hear within us distinctly
       pronounced words that have no relation to what we are
       preoccupied with. Where do they come from?
       “Yes, and even entire sentences, especially when the senses
       begin to grow dull. It is sometimes the faint echo of a
       spirit who wishes to communicate with you.”
409.   Often, while we have our eyes shut during a state that is not
       yet sleep, we see distinct images and figures in the minutest
       detail. Is this an effect of vision or of imagination?
       “The body being numb, the spirit tries to break its chains –
       it travels and sees. If sleep were complete, this vision would
       be a dream.”
410.   During sleep or a nap, we sometimes have ideas that seem very
       worthwhile, but which in spite of the efforts we make to recall
       them are erased from our waking memory. Where do these
       ideas come from?
       “They are the result of the freedom of the spirit, who
       emancipates itself and enjoys broader faculties for the moment.
       Also, they are frequently counsels given by other spirits.”
       – Of what use are such ideas or counsels if the memory of
       them is lost and they cannot be employed?
       “Such ideas sometimes belong more to the spirit world
       than to the corporeal one. But most frequently, if the body
       forgets them the spirit remembers them nonetheless, and
       the idea returns at the appropriate time as an inspiration
       of the moment.”
411.   During the time that the spirit is disengaged from matter and
       acts as a spirit, does it know the time of its death?
       “It often has a presentiment. Sometimes it has a very clear
       awareness of it, which gives it an intuition about it while


                                273

                       Part Two – Chapter VIII


       awake. That is why some individuals sometimes foresee
       their own death with great precision.”
412.   Can the activity of the spirit during the repose or sleep of the
       body fatigue the body?
       “Yes, because the spirit is connected to the body like a
       balloon tied to a post. In the same manner that the jerking
       movements of the balloon shake the post, the activity of
       the spirit reacts upon the body and may produce fatigue.”


 Visits between the Spirits of Living Persons
413.   The principle of the soul’s emancipation during sleep seems to
       indicate that we live two lives simultaneously: that of the body,
       involving our life of outward relationships, and that of the soul,
       involving our life of concealed relationships. Is this precise?
       “In the state of emancipation, the life of the body yields to
       that of the soul, but properly speaking there are not two
       lives. Instead, they are two phases of the same life; people
       do not live double lives.”
414.   Can two people who know each other visit each other
       during sleep?
       “Yes, and many others, who do not think they know
       each other while awake, meet and converse. Without
       even suspecting it, you may even have friends in another
       country. The phenomenon during sleep in which you
       visit friends, relatives, acquaintances and individuals who
       may be useful to you is so frequent that you experience it
       almost every night.”
415.   Of what use are these nocturnal visits if we do not
       remember them?


                                 274

                     The Emancipation of the Soul


       “Ordinarily, upon awakening, an intuition remains that
       is almost always the origin of certain ideas which arise
       spontaneously without your being able to explain them, and
       which are but the ones grasped during such colloquies.”
416.   Can people cause spirit visits at will? For example, can they
       say upon going to bed, “Tonight I wish to meet in spirit with
       such and such person to speak with him/her and tell him/her
       about such and such thing”?
       “Here is what actually happens: the person sleeps and
       the spirit wakens, but the spirit is often very far from
       following what the person resolved while awake because
       the life of the person interests the spirit very little when
       it is set free from matter. This applies to individuals
       who are already quite evolved, though; the others spend
       their spirit existence in an entirely different manner.
       These either give in to their passions or remain inactive
       altogether. Thus, it may happen that, depending on the
       reason proposed, the spirit may go to visit the desired
       individual, but the mere desire while awake to do so is
       not its reason for actually doing it.”
417.   Can a certain number of incarnate spirits meet and form a
       gathering?
       “Of course. The bonds of friendships, old or new,
       frequently reunite a number of spirits who feel happy at
       being together.”
        The word “old” refers to the ties of friendship contracted in previous
        existences. Upon awakening, we bring back an intuition of the ideas
        we have acquired during such concealed colloquies, even though
        their source appears unknown to us.

418.   If a person believed a friend to be dead but who in reality
       was not, could that person meet the friend in spirit, and thus


                                  275

                                 Part Two – Chapter VIII


           know that she was still alive? In such a case, could this person
           have an intuition about it upon awaking?
           “As a spirit, the individual can certainly see the friend and
           know how she is. If the belief in her death was not meant
           as a trial, the person will have a presentiment that she is
           alive, or that she is in fact dead.”


     The Concealed Transmission of Thought50
419.       Why is it that the same idea – a discovery, for example – arises
           at the same time in many places?
           “We have already stated that during sleep spirits communicate
           with one another. Well then, when the body awakens, the
           spirit remembers what it has learned and the person thinks
           he or she has invented it. Thus, many may seem to have
           discovered the same thing at the same time. When you say
           that an idea is ‘floating around’, you employ a figure of speech
           that is more precise than you think. Without even suspecting
           it, everyone has contributed toward developing it.”
              In this way, our spirit itself often unknowingly reveals the object of
              our waking preoccupations to other spirits.

420.       Can spirits communicate with one another when the body is
           completely awake?
           “A spirit is not enclosed in its body as if it were in a box;
           it radiates all around in every direction. Hence, it can
           communicate with other spirits even in the waking state,
           although it does so with more difficulty.”
421.       Why do two perfectly awake persons sometimes have the same
           thought at exactly the same time?

                     The Emancipation of the Soul


        “They are two attuned spirits who communicate with
        each other and read each other’s thoughts even when they
        are not asleep.”
          When spirits meet, there is sometimes a communication of
          thought that enables two persons to see and understand each
          other without the need for verbal language. They may be said to
          speak the language of spirits.



       Lethargy, Catalepsy, Apparent Death
422.    Lethargic and cataleptic individuals generally see and hear
        what is occurring around them, but they cannot express it. Do
        they see and hear through the eyes and ears of the body?
        “No, through the spirit. The spirit is conscious but is
        unable to communicate.”
        – Why is it unable to communicate?
        “The state of the body prevents it. This peculiar state of
        the organs proves to you that there is something more to a
        human being than just a body because, although the body
        is not functioning, the spirit continues to act.”
423.    In the state of lethargy, can the spirit separate itself entirely
        from the body in such a way as to give the body all the
        appearances of death, and then return to it?
        “The body is not dead in the lethargic state, because there
        are functions that continue to operate. Vitality remains in
        a latent state, like in a cocoon, but it is not extinguished.
        The spirit is always connected to the body while the
        body is alive, but once the ties are broken by real death
        and by the decomposition of the organs, the separation
        is complete and the spirit no longer returns. When an


                                  277

                        Part Two – Chapter VIII


       apparently dead person comes back to life, it is because
       death had not actually been consummated.”
424.   Through care given in time, can one strengthen the ties that
       are about to break and bring back to life a being who, without
       such attention, would definitely die?
       “Yes, of course; you have evidence of this every day. In
       such cases, magnetism is often a powerful means because
       it gives the body the vital fluid needed to keep its organs
       functioning.”
        Lethargy and catalepsy have the same principle, which is the
        temporary loss of sensitivity and motion due to an as-yet unexplained
        physiological cause. They differ from each other in that, in lethargy,
        the suspension of the vital forces is generalized and gives the body
        all the appearances of death, while in catalepsy it is localized and
        can affect a larger or smaller portion of the body so as to leave the
        intelligence free to express itself, a fact that would not permit it
        to be confused with death. Lethargy is always natural; catalepsy is
        sometimes spontaneous but it may also be artificially induced and
        undone by magnetic action.



                      Somnambulism
425.   Does natural somnambulism have any connection to dreams?
       How can it be explained?
       “It is a state of the soul in which its independence is
       more complete than in dreams; thus, its faculties are
       more unrestrained. The soul has perceptions that it does
       not attain in the dream state, which is actually a state of
       imperfect somnambulism.
       “In somnambulism, the spirit is in total possession of
       itself, but the physical organs are in a sort of cataleptic


                                  278

                    The Emancipation of the Soul


       state and no longer receive external impressions. This
       state manifests especially during sleep, the time during
       which the spirit can temporarily leave the body, while
       the body enjoys the repose that is indispensable to
       matter. When somnambulistic-related activity occurs,
       it is because the spirit is preoccupied with one thing or
       another that requires the physical body, which it then
       uses in the same way it would if it were to employ a table
       or other material object in the phenomena of physical
       manifestations, or a hand in written communications. In
       dreams that you are conscious of, the sensorial organs,
       including those related to memory, begin to awaken
       and imperfectly receive the impressions produced by
       objects or external causes, and communicate them to the
       spirit. The spirit, also in a state of repose, only perceives
       confused and often fragmentary sensations, which
       without any apparent reason are mixed in with vague
       memories of either the present life or previous ones. It
       is therefore easy to understand why somnambulists do
       not remember anything and why most of the time the
       dreams they do remember have no meaning. I say most of
       the time because sometimes dreams are the consequence
       of a precise memory of events of a previous life, and
       sometimes even a sort of intuition of the future.”
426.   Does so-called magnetic somnambulism have any connection
       to natural somnambulism?
       “It is the same thing with the difference that it is artificially
       induced.”
427.   What is the nature of the agent called the magnetic fluid?
       “It is the vital fluid or animalized electricity, and is a
       modification of the universal fluid.”



                                 279

                       Part Two – Chapter VIII


428.   What is the cause of somnambulistic clairvoyance?
       “We have already told you: it is soul sight.”
429.   How can the somnambulist see through opaque objects?
       “No object is completely opaque – except to your
       dense organs. We have already stated that matter is no
       obstacle to spirits, since they can pass right through it.
       Somnambulists frequently tell you that they see through
       their forehead, through their knee, etc., because you are
       entirely immersed in matter and do not understand that
       they can see without the help of the organs; nonetheless,
       at your insistence, they believe they actually need them.
       If you were to leave them alone, however, they would
       understand that they see through all the parts of the body,
       or, rather, that they see apart from their body.”
430.   Since the clairvoyance of somnambulists is that of their soul or
       spirit, why don’t they see everything, and why do they so often
       make mistakes?
       “First, it is not given to imperfect spirits to see everything
       and know everything. You know very well that they still share
       your errors and prejudices. Second, while they are connected
       to matter they do not enjoy all their spirit faculties. God has
       given clairvoyance to humankind for a useful and serious
       purpose, and not so that it may learn what it should not
       know. That is why somnambulists do not know everything.”
431.   What is the source of somnambulists’ innate ideas, and how
       can they speak with such precision about things of which they
       are ignorant in the waking state, and which are even above
       their intellectual capacity?
       “It just so happens that somnambulists may actually
       possess more knowledge than you might think, but it is
       dormant – their corporeal envelope is too imperfect for

                                280

                     The Emancipation of the Soul


       them to be able to remember such knowledge. But who are
       they, after all? Like us, they are spirits who have incarnated
       to fulfill their mission, and the somnambulistic state into
       which they enter awakens them from their mental lethargy.
       We have repeatedly told you that humans live many times
       and when they reincarnate it causes the material loss of
       what they had learned in a previous life. When they enter
       what you call the crisis state, they remember what they
       already know, but always incompletely. They know, but
       they cannot say where such knowledge comes from or why
       they have it. When the crisis passes, the memory is erased
       entirely and they return to their waking state knowledge.”
        Experience has shown that somnambulists also receive
        communications from other spirits, who transmit to them what
        they must say and supply them with what they lack. This is
        especially seen in cases involving medical prescriptions: the spirit
        of the somnambulist discerns what the malady is and another
        spirit indicates the remedy. This double action is sometimes
        patent, whereas at other times it is revealed through their frequent
        expressions: They are telling me to say, or they are forbidding me to
        say such and such. In the latter case, it is always dangerous to insist
        on obtaining information that has been denied; otherwise, the door
        opens to frivolous spirits who unscrupulously talk about everything
        without being at all interested in the truth.

432.   How do you explain the remote viewing ability that some
       somnambulists experience?
       “Doesn’t the soul travel about during sleep? The same
       thing occurs in somnambulism.”
433.   Does the greater or lesser development of somnambulistic
       clairvoyance depend on the physical organization of the body
       or on the nature of the incarnate spirit?
       “On both. There are physical dispositions that allow the


                                   281

                        Part Two – Chapter VIII


       spirit to disengage itself easily or not so easily from matter.”
434.   Are the faculties that the spirit of the somnambulist enjoys the
       same as those of the spirit after death?
       “To a certain extent, but the somnambulist’s spirit still
       finds itself attached to matter, and one must take this fact
       into account.”
435.   Can somnambulists see other spirits?
       “Most can see them very easily, but it depends on the
       nature and degree of their lucidity. However, sometimes
       they do not at first understand what other spirits are and
       thus mistake them for corporeal beings. This happens
       especially with those who have no knowledge of Spiritism,
       because they do not yet comprehend the nature of spirits;
       their human appearance fools them and that is why they
       think they are seeing living persons.”
         The same effect is produced at the moment of death among those
         who think they are still alive. Nothing around them appears to have
         changed. Spirits appear to them as having bodies similar to ours
         and they mistake the appearance of their own bodies as being real.

436.   Do somnambulists who see at a distance see from the place
       where their body is or from where their soul is?
       “Why ask such a question, since it is the soul that sees and
       not the body?”
437.   Since it is actually the soul that travels about, how can
       somnambulists experience in their body the sensations of the
       heat or cold of the place where their soul is, which is sometimes
       very far from where their body actually is?
       “Their soul has not entirely left the body. It always remains
       connected to it by the tie that joins them, and this tie is the
       conductor of sensations. When two persons correspond


                                  282

                     The Emancipation of the Soul


       between one city and another by means of electricity, the
       electricity is the tie between their thoughts; thanks to it,
       they can communicate as though they were right next to
       each other.”
438.   Does the use that somnambulists make of their faculties
       during life influence the state of their spirit after death?
       “Very considerably, like the good or bad use of all the
       faculties that God has given to human beings.”


                             Ecstasy
439.   What is the difference between ecstasy and somnambulism?
       “Ecstasy is a more refined type of somnambulism – the
       soul of the ecstatic is more independent.”
440.   Does the soul of the ecstatic really go to higher realms?
       “Yes, it sees them and comprehends the happiness of those
       who dwell there, which is why they would like to remain
       there; however, there are realms inaccessible to spirits who
       are not sufficiently purified.”
441.   When ecstatics express the desire to leave the earth, do they speak
       sincerely? And doesn’t the preservation instinct retain them?
       “That depends on the spirit’s degree of purification. If
       it sees that its future situation will be better than the
       present life, it makes an effort to break the ties that bind
       it to the earth.”
442.   If we were to abandon ecstatics to themselves, could their soul
       definitively abandon their body?
       “Yes, they could die; that is why it is necessary to call them
       back by means of everything that might attach them to


                                  283

                       Part Two – Chapter VIII


       this world, above all making them understand that if the
       chain that holds them here were to break, it would actually
       be the best means of not remaining in that place where
       they see that they could be so happy.”
443.   Ecstatics claim to see things that are obviously the product of
       an imagination overly excited by earthly beliefs and prejudices.
       Thus, isn’t what they see unreal?
       “What they see is real to them, but since their spirit is
       always under the influence of earthly ideas, they may see
       it in their own way, or rather, they may express it in a
       language according to the prejudices and ideas they were
       raised with or the ones you were raised with, in order to
       make themselves better understood. It is especially in this
       sense that they can err.”
444.   What degree of trust can be placed in ecstatics’ revelations?
       “Ecstatics can be mistaken quite frequently, especially
       when they want to grasp what must remain a mystery
       for humankind. In such cases, they may transmit their
       own ideas, or they may become the pawns of deceiving
       spirits who take advantage of their enthusiasm in order to
       delude them.”
445.   What consequences may be drawn from the phenomena of
       somnambulism and ecstasy? Could they be a sort of glimpse
       into the future life?
       “Or better stated, they get a glimpse into the past and
       future life. Humans should study these phenomena
       because they will find in them the solution to more than
       one mystery that their reason has tried to grasp in vain.”
446.   Could the phenomena of somnambulism and ecstasy be
       brought into harmony with materialism?


                                284

                     The Emancipation of the Soul


       “Those who study them in good faith and without
       preconceived ideas could be neither materialist nor atheist.”

                        Second Sight
447.   Does the phenomenon called “second sight” have any
       connection to dreaming and somnambulism?
       “All of this is one and the same thing. What you call second sight
       is, again, the spirit in a state of greater freedom, even though
       the body is not asleep. Second sight is the sight of the soul.”
448.   Is second sight permanent?
       “The faculty, yes; the ability to exercise it, no. On worlds
       less material than yours, spirits disengage themselves more
       easily, and while still maintaining articulated language,
       they communicate with one another through thought
       only. Second sight is also a permanent faculty for the
       majority of them. Their normal state may be compared
       to that of your lucid somnambulists, and that is also why
       they manifest themselves to you more easily than those
       who are incarnated in denser bodies.”
449.   Does second sight develop spontaneously or by the will of those
       who possess it?
       “Most of the time it is spontaneous, but the will can often
       play a large role too. Thus, you can take certain individuals
       called fortune tellers, for example, some of whom possess this
       faculty of second sight, and you will see that it is their own
       will that helps them enter such a state – what you call vision.”
450.   Is second sight capable of being developed through practice?
       “Yes, effort always leads to progress, and the veil that
       covers things becomes clearer.”

                        Part Two – Chapter VIII


       – Is this faculty linked to one’s physical organization?
       “Certainly, physical organization plays its role, and there
       are organizations that are incompatible with this faculty.”
451.   Why does second sight appear hereditary in certain families?
       “It is due to similarity of organizations – transmitted like
       other physical qualities – and afterwards, development
       of the faculty through a kind of education, which is also
       transmitted from one to the next.”
452.   Is it true that certain circumstances can cause second sight to
       develop?
       “Illness, the approach of danger or a large crisis may
       develop it. In such instances, the body is sometimes in
       a particular state that allows the spirit to see what you
       cannot see with the eyes of your body.”
         Times of crisis, calamity and great emotion; in short, all the causes
         of mental over-excitement sometimes bring about the development
         of second sight. It seems that in the presence of danger, Providence
         has given us the means of calling on it. All persecuted sects and
         individuals offer numerous instances of this fact.

453.   Are persons gifted with second sight always aware of it?
       “Not always. For them it is a completely natural thing,
       and many believe that if others paid closer attention to
       themselves, they would realize they possess the same faculty.”
454.   May we attribute to a sort of second sight the astuteness of certain
       persons who, without appearing to have anything extraordinary
       about them, judge things with more precision than others?
       “It always involves the soul. The soul radiates more freely
       and judges better than when under the veil of matter.”
       – In certain cases, can this faculty provide foreknowledge of
       future events?

                    The Emancipation of the Soul


       “Yes. It may also provide a presentiment. There are many
       degrees of this faculty and the same individual may possess
       all or only some of them.”

A Theoretical Summary of Somnambulism,
        Ecstasy and Second Sight
455.   The phenomena of natural somnambulism are produced
       spontaneously and independently of any known external
       cause, but among some persons gifted with a special
       physical organization they may be induced through the
       action of the magnetic agent.
       The state called magnetic somnambulism is no different
       than natural somnambulism except that it is artificially
       produced, whereas the other is spontaneous.
       Natural somnambulism is a widely known occurrence and
       no one questions its reality, despite the marvelous character
       of its phenomena. So, why would magnetic somnambulism
       be any more extraordinary or irrational simply because of
       the fact that it is produced artificially like so many other
       things? It is said that charlatans have exploited it – one
       more reason for it not to be left in their hands. Once
       science finally takes full possession of it, charlatanism will
       have much less credit among the masses. Meanwhile, since
       both natural and artificial somnambulism are a fact – there
       is no arguing against fact – they are establishing themselves
       in spite of the ill will of some. This is occurring even in the
       realm of science, where it is entering through a multitude
       of side doors instead of through the front. And when it is
       fully established there, it will be necessary to grant it the
       right of citizenship.



                                287

                Part Two – Chapter VIII


For Spiritism, somnambulism is more than a physiological
phenomenon; it is a light projected onto psychology. It
is during somnambulism that the soul can be studied
because that is when the soul appears uncovered. One of
the phenomena that characterize the soul is clairvoyance
independent of the ordinary organs of sight. Those who
contest this fact do so on the grounds that somnambulists
do not see at all times and at the will of the experimenter,
as they do with their eyes. Should we be surprised that
the means being different, the effects are not the same?
Would it be rational to seek identical effects when the
instruments differ? The soul has its properties just as the
eyes have theirs, and it is necessary to judge them in their
own right and not by analogy.
The cause of clairvoyance in the magnetic somnambulist and
natural somnambulist is identical: an attribute of the soul, a
faculty inherent in every part of the incorporeal being existing
within us, and having no limits beyond those assigned to the
soul itself. Somnambulists can see every place where their
soul can go, whatever the distance may be.
In the case of remote viewing, somnambulists do not see
things from the place where their body is, as if they were
looking through a telescope. They see them as present, as
though they were actually at the place where those things
exist, because, in reality, their soul is actually there. That
is why their body seems non-existent and deprived of
sensations until the moment in which the soul retakes
possession of it. This partial separation of soul and body
is an abnormal state that may last for a short or long
time, but not indefinitely. This separation is what causes
the fatigue that the body experiences after a certain time,
especially when the soul is involved in some active pursuit.


                         288

              The Emancipation of the Soul


Soul sight or spirit sight is not circumscribed and has no
determined seat, which explains why somnambulists cannot
assign one particular organ to it. They see because they see
without knowing why or how; as spirits, sight for them does
not have a specific site in the body. When they do refer to
their body, sight seems to occur in the centers where the vital
activity is greatest, especially in the brain, in the stomach area
or in the organ which for them is the most intense point of
connection between the spirit and the body.
The power of somnambulistic lucidity is not unlimited,
however. Even when completely free, spirits are limited
in their faculties and knowledge according to the degree
of purification they have reached – even more so than
when attached to and under the influence of matter. This
is the reason why somnambulistic clairvoyance is neither
universal nor infallible. Its infallibility should be relied on
even less the more it is diverted from the purpose proposed
by nature in order to be transformed into an object of
curiosity and experimentation.
When the spirit of the somnambulist finds itself in the state of
disengagement, it enters into communication more easily with
other incarnate or discarnate spirits. This communication is
established through the mutual contact of the fluids comprising
their perispirits and enabling the transmission of thought,
like an electric wire. Somnambulists, therefore, do not need
thoughts to be articulated through words. Instead, they sense
and divine them, rendering them eminently impressionable and
accessible to the influences of the mental atmosphere around
them. That is also why a large group of spectators – especially
of on-lookers who are more or less ill-willed – essentially harms
the development of their faculties, which close themselves off,
so to speak, and do not unfold with full liberty as they would


                          289

                               Part Two – Chapter VIII


          in more intimate or sympathetic surroundings. The presence of
          ill-willed or antipathetic persons produces an effect on them similar
          to when a hand touches a sensitive plant.51
          Somnambulists see their own spirit and body at the same
          time. They are, so to speak, two beings that represent a
          double existence – spiritual and corporeal – blended together
          by the ties that unite them. Somnambulists do not always
          comprehend this situation, and such duality frequently makes
          them speak of themselves as though they were speaking of a
          stranger. What happens is that, in one moment, the corporeal
          being speaks to the spirit being, and in the next moment, it is
          the spirit being that speaks to the corporeal.
          The spirit acquires an increase of knowledge and
          experience during each one of its corporeal existences. It
          partially forgets them during its reincarnation in dense
          matter, but it remembers them as a spirit. That is how
          certain somnambulists display knowledge superior to their
          degree of education and even superior to their apparent
          intellectual capacity. The possible intellectual and scientific
          underdevelopment of somnambulists in the waking state,
          however, does not allow one to prejudge anything about
          the knowledge they may reveal in the lucid state. According
          to the circumstances and objective they have in view, they
          may draw this knowledge from their own experience, from
          their clairvoyance of current events, or from the counsels
          they receive from other spirits. However, the accuracy
          with which they describe things depends on the degree of
          their spirit’s evolution.
          Through the phenomena of somnambulism, whether
          natural or magnetically induced, Providence furnishes us
 		Sensitive plant: “A shrubby tropical American plant… having leaflets and leafstalks that
51

  fold and droop when touched” (American Heritage College Dictionary, 1979). – Tr.

              The Emancipation of the Soul


undeniable evidence of the existence and independence of
the soul, and enables us to witness the sublime spectacle of its
emancipation. Moreover, through these phenomena it opens
to us the book of our destiny. When somnambulists describe
what is occurring at a distance, it is obvious that they really
are seeing it, but not through the eyes of their body. They
see themselves at that place after having been transported to
it. There is something of themselves present there, and since
that something is not their body, it can only be their soul or
spirit. While humans get lost in the subtleties of an abstract
and unintelligible metaphysics in pursuit of the causes of
our mental existence, God routinely places in front of them
and within reach the simplest and most patent means for the
study of experimental psychology.
Ecstasy is the state in which the independence between the
soul and body is expressed in the most sensitive way, and
even becomes somewhat palpable.
In both dreams and somnambulism, the soul wanders through
terrestrial worlds, whereas in ecstasy, it enters an unknown
world, that of ethereal spirits, with whom it communicates,
without, however, overstepping certain bounds – if it did, the
soul would completely break the ties connecting it to the body.
A resplendent and entirely new brilliance surrounds this soul.
Harmonies unknown on earth enrapture it, an indefinable
well-being permeates it, the spirit enjoys a foretaste of celestial
beatitude, and it may be said that it has set one foot on the
threshold of eternity.
In the state of ecstasy, the nullification of the body is
almost complete. It only maintains organic life per se and
it feels that the soul is connected to it by only a single
thread, which with any further effort would break forever.


                           291

                Part Two – Chapter VIII


In this state, all earthly thoughts disappear in order to give
way to the pure sentiment that is the very essence of our
immaterial being. Entirely enraptured by that sublime
contemplation, ecstatics regard life as a momentary pause.
For them, good and evil, and the crude joys and hardships
of this world are no more than the futile incidents of a
journey of which they feel happy to see the end.
The same thing happens with ecstatics as with somnambulists:
their lucidity may be more purified or less so, and how fully
they comprehend things depends on the degree to which
their spirit has evolved. At times, there is more exaltation
than true lucidity among ecstatics, or rather, their exaltation
impairs their lucidity. That is why their revelations are
frequently a mixture of truths and errors, of sublime and
absurd – even ridiculous – things. Imperfect spirits often take
advantage of this exaltation – always a source of frailty – in
order to dominate the ecstatic who does not know how to
master it. To do so, these spirits produce appearances that will
keep the ecstatic attached to the ideas and prejudices of his
or her waking state. This is an obstacle, but not all cases are
similar. It is our responsibility to coolly judge and weigh their
revelations in the balance of reason.
The emancipation of the soul sometimes even manifests
in the waking state and produces the phenomenon called
second sight, which gives to those possessing it the faculty
of seeing, hearing and feeling beyond the limits of their
normal senses. They perceive things at distance wherever
their soul may extend its action, and they see, so to speak,
through their ordinary sight, as a type of mirage.
At the moment in which the phenomenon of second sight
is produced, the physical state is considerably modified:
the eyes become somewhat hazy, looking without seeing,

                          292

            The Emancipation of the Soul


and the whole physiognomy reflects a type of exaltation. It
is obvious that the organs of sight are not involved in this
phenomenon, because the vision has been seen to persist
even with the eyes shut.
This faculty seems as natural as that of normal sight for
those who possess it. They consider it a normal attribute
of their being and it does not seem exceptional to them.
Generally, forgetfulness follows this temporary lucidity,
the remembrance of which becomes more and more
vague, finally disappearing like a dream.
The power of second sight ranges from a confused
sensation to a clear and distinct perception of things
present or absent. In its rudimentary state, it gives to
some individuals tact, astuteness and a kind of sureness
in their actions, which may manifest itself as an ability to
evaluate, on first contact, another person’s moral standing.
When this second sight is more developed, it awakens
presentiments, and when developed even further, it
shows events that have already happened or that are in
the process of happening.
Natural and artificial somnambulism, ecstasy and second
sight are no more than varieties or modifications of effects
arising from the same cause. Like dreams, such phenomena
belong to the natural order, and that is why they have
existed throughout time. History shows us that they have
been known about and even exploited since remotest
antiquity and in them may be found the explanation of
an infinite number of events that preconceived ideas have
regarded as supernatural.

  The Reading of Our Thoughts by Spirits
456.    Can spirits see everything we do?
        “They can because you are constantly surrounded by
        them; nonetheless, they see only those things to which
        they direct their attention. They are not concerned about
        things that do not interest them.”


                                295

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


457.   Can spirits know our most secret thoughts?
       “They often know about what you would like to conceal
       even from yourselves; neither actions nor thoughts can be
       concealed from them.”
       – So it would be easier to conceal something from a person
       while he or she is alive than to do so after he or she has died?
       “Certainly, and when you think you are well-hidden, you
       often have a crowd of spirits around you, watching you.”
458.   What do the spirits who surround and observe us think about us?
       “That depends. Frivolous spirits laugh at the little
       annoyances they cause you and they scoff at your
       impatience. Serious spirits, on the other hand, pity your
       imperfections and try to help you.”


       The Concealed Influence of Spirits
        on Our Thoughts and Actions
459.   Do spirits have any influence on our thoughts and actions?
       “Their influence on you in this regard is greater than you
       suppose, for very frequently it is they who guide you.”
460.   Do we have our own thoughts plus others that are suggested to us?
       “Your soul is a spirit who thinks by itself; nevertheless,
       you must have noticed that many thoughts occur to you
       all at the same time with regards to the same subject, and
       that they frequently contradict one another. Well, they
       are always a combination of your own ideas and other
       spirits’ ideas, and this is what renders you uncertain –
       you have several ideas within your mind battling it out
       with each other.”


                                 296

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


461.   How can we distinguish between our own thoughts and those
       suggested to us?
       “When a thought is suggested to you, it is like a voice speaking
       to you. Your own thoughts are usually those that occur to you
       at first impulse. Actually, you should not concern yourselves
       with such a distinction, and it is often more useful not even
       to know about it – you act more freely. If you make the right
       decision, you will act more willingly; if you make the wrong
       one, your responsibility will be greater.”
462.   Do individuals of intelligence and genius always draw their
       ideas from within themselves?
       “Their ideas sometimes arise from their own spirit, but
       frequently they are suggested to them by other spirits who
       deem them capable of understanding them and worthy of
       transmitting them. When they cannot find ideas within
       themselves, they appeal for inspiration; they are making
       an evocation without even suspecting it.”
         If it were useful for us to be able to distinguish between our own
         thoughts and those suggested to us, God would have given us the
         means to do so, just as God has given us the means to distinguish
         between day and night. But when a matter seems va­gue, it must be
         so for our own good.

463.   It is sometimes said that the first impulse is always the best. Is
       this correct?
       “It can be good or bad, according to the nature of the
       incarnate spirit. It is always good for the one who listens
       to good inspirations.”
464.   How can we tell if a suggested thought comes from a good or
       an evil spirit?
       “Study the matter: good spirits give only good advice; it is
       your responsibility to make the distinction.”

                                  297

                         Part Two – Chapter IX


465.   For what purpose do imperfect spirits induce us to evil?
       “To make you suffer as they themselves do.”
       – Does it actually lessen their sufferings?
       “No, but they do so anyway out of envy at seeing happier
       beings.”
       – What kinds of suffering do they wish to inflict on us?
       “Those that result from belonging to a lower order and
       from being far from God.”
466.   Why does God permit spirits to incite us to evil?
       “Imperfect spirits are meant as instruments for testing the
       faith and constancy of individuals in the practice of the
       good. As a spirit, you must progress in the knowledge of
       the infinite, and you experience the trials of evil in order
       to arrive at the good. Our mission is to place you upon the
       upright path. When evil influences act on you, however,
       it is you yourself who call to them out of your desire for
       evil. Little-evolved spirits come to help you in evil when
       you have the will to commit it. However, they cannot help
       you in evil except when you actually desire to indulge in
       it. If you are inclined to murder, very well, there will be a
       swarm of spirits who will maintain that thought in your
       mind. However, there will also be others who will try to
       influence you for good, and this re-equalizes the balance,
       leaving you as master of yourself.”
         It is thus that God leaves to our conscience the choice of the course
         we must follow and the freedom to yield to either of the opposing
         influences acting on us.

467.   Can people avoid the influence of spirits who incite them to evil?
       “Yes, because they only attach themselves to those who solicit
       them with their desires or attract them with their thoughts.”

                                   298

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


468.   Do spirits whose influence is repelled by an individual’s will
       finally give up on their attempts?
       “What else could they do? When they have nothing to
       do, they leave. Nevertheless, they attentively watch for a
       favorable moment, as the cat attentively watches the mouse.”
469.   By what means can we neutralize the influence of evil spirits?
       “By doing good and placing all your trust in God,
       you repel their influence and you destroy the power
       they desire to have over you. Guard yourselves against
       listening to the suggestions of spirits who excite evil
       thoughts in your mind, those who incite discord and
       arouse in you all the evil passions. Above all, distrust
       spirits who flatter your pride, for they are attacking you
       at your weakest point. That is why Jesus teaches you to
       say in the Lord’s Prayer, ‘Lord, do not let us fall into
       temptation, but deliver us from evil!’”
470.   The spirits who seek to lead us into evil and who thus put our
       moral firmness to the test, have they received a mission to do
       this, and if it is in fact a mission for them to fulfill, will they
       be responsible for doing so?
       “Spirits never receive a mission to do evil. When they do
       evil deeds, it is by their own will and they will have to
       suffer the consequences. God may let them test you but
       never directly orders them to; it is your responsibility to
       repel them.”
471.   When we experience a sensation of anguish, of indefinable
       anxiety or inner satisfaction without a known cause, does it
       result from our physical disposition at the time?
       “It is almost always the effect of communications you have
       with spirits without even suspecting it – or those you have
       had with them during sleep.”

                                  299

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


472.   Are spirits who want to incite us to evil limited to taking
       advantage of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, or
       can they create such circumstances?
       “They may take advantage of a circumstance, but frequently
       they cause it, pushing you without your being aware of it
       toward the object of your ambition. Thus, for example, a
       man finds a quantity of money by the road. Spirits have
       not placed the money there but they may have instilled in
       the man the thought of going in that direction. Then, they
       suggest he keep the money, while others suggest he return
       it to its rightful owner. The same process happens with all
       other temptations.”


                       The Possessed
473.   Can a spirit temporarily take over the corporeal envelope of a
       living person? In other words, can it enter an animate body
       and replace the spirit incarnated in it?
       “A spirit does not enter a body as you enter a house.
       Instead, it associates with an incarnate spirit who has
       its same defects and qualities so that they can both act
       conjointly. Nevertheless, it is always the incarnate spirit
       who acts upon the matter enveloping it and according
       to its own wishes. A spirit cannot replace the one who is
       incarnate because the spirit is connected to the body until
       the time set for the end of its material existence.”
474.   If there is no such thing as possession per se, that is, the
       cohabitation of two spirits in the same body, may a spirit
       nonetheless find itself dependent on another spirit so that it
       sees itself “subjugated” or “obsessed” by it to such a degree that
       its own will is in some way paralyzed?


                                 300

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       “Yes, and these are the truly possessed. You must
       understand, however, that this kind of domination never
       occurs without the participation of the one who suffers
       it, either through weakness or desire. Epileptics and insane
       individuals have often been taken as being possessed, but
       they are in need of a doctor rather than an exorcist.”
         In its common acceptance, the word possession presumes the
         existence of demons – a category of beings of a depraved nature –
         and the cohabitation of one of these beings with the soul of an
         individual in his or her body. But since there are no demons in
         this sense and since two spirits cannot simultaneously inhabit the
         same body, there can be no one who is possessed according to the
         idea normally attached to the word. By the expression possessed, one
         should only understand it to mean the absolute dependence of a
         soul in relation to the imperfect spirit who has subjugated it.

475.   Can these persons by themselves repel such evil spirits and free
       themselves from their domination?
       “You can always rid yourself of any burden when you have
       a firm will.”
476.   Couldn’t it be the case that the obsession by an evil spirit is
       such that the subjugated person does not even perceive it?
       Couldn’t a third person put an end to the subjection, and in
       such a case, what role should he or she play?
       “If the individual is morally upright, his or her will power may
       help by appealing to the cooperation of good spirits, because
       the more moral a person is, the more power that person
       has regarding imperfect spirits in order to repel them, and
       regarding good ones in order to attract them. Nevertheless,
       this third person will be completely powerless if the one who
       is subjugated does not cooperate; after all, there are persons
       who take delight in a dependence that satisfies their tastes and
       desires. In all cases, however, those who do not have a pure


                                   301

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


       heart cannot have any influence whatsoever – good spirits
       ignore them and evil ones do not fear them.”
477.   Are exorcism formulas at all effective against evil spirits?
       “No. When these spirits see anyone who takes such
       formulas seriously, they laugh and persevere.”
478.   There are persons animated by good intentions, but who are
       obsessed nevertheless. What are the best means for them to free
       themselves from obsessing spirits?
       “Tire their patience, pay no attention to their suggestions
       and show them that they are wasting their time; then,
       when they see they can do nothing, they will withdraw.”
479.   Is prayer an effective means for curing obsession?
       “Prayer is a powerful aid in everything, but you must
       realize that it is insufficient to simply mutter a few words
       to obtain what you desire. God helps those who act – not
       those who limit themselves merely to asking. Therefore,
       obsessed persons must do their part in order to destroy in
       themselves the cause that attracts evil spirits.”
480.   What should be thought about the expulsion of demons,
       spoken of in the Gospel?
       “That depends on the interpretation. If you mean by
       demon an evil spirit who subjugates an individual, when
       its influence is destroyed, it will truly be expelled. If you
       attribute an illness to a demon, when you have cured the
       sickness, you will also have expelled the demon. A thing
       may be true or false according to the meaning given to the
       words. The greatest truths may seem absurd when only the
       form is observed and when an allegory is taken for reality.
       Understand this well and try to remember it because it is
       of universal application.”

                The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


                            Convulsionaries52
481.      Do spirits play any role in the phenomena produced among
          individuals called convulsionaries?
          “Yes, a very large one, as does magnetism, its primary
          source. But charlatanism has frequently exploited and
          exaggerated the phenomena, thereby making them appear
          to be ridiculous.”
          – In general, of what nature are the spirits who concur in
          these types of phenomena?
          “They are little-evolved. Do you believe that evolved
          spirits would enjoy such things?”
482.      How can the abnormal state of convulsionaries and hysterical
          persons suddenly extend to an entire population?
          “By sympathetic effect. Mental dispositions are
          communicated more easily in certain cases. You are not
          such a stranger to the effects of magnetism that you cannot
          understand this fact and the role certain spirits play in it
          through their sympathy with those who cause it.”53
             Among the remarkable faculties noted in convulsionaries, we easily
             recognize some of which somnambulism and mesmerism offer
             numerous examples. Such are, among others: physical insensitivity,

 		Kardec’s interest in explaining this phenomenon arises from cases he had knowledge of
52

  personally, such as: a) The Convulsionaries of St. Medard: Father Francis Fâris died in 1727
  and was buried at St. Medard Cemetery. His brother built him a little tomb to which the
  poor came to pray. A few cures were produced there, which were considered miraculous,
  and some convulsions occurred, which were considered dangerous and silly. The cemetery
  was closed in 1732 (see La Revue Spirite, Nov. 1859); b) The Ursuline Nuns of Loudon,
  1632-34: Several nuns of the convent, including the Mother Superior, were seized with
  violent convulsions, symptoms of catalepsy and demonic possession. Blasphemies and
  obscenities poured from their mouths and were believed to have come from the Devil.
  (Nandor Fodor. Encyclopedia of Psychic Science) – Tr.
 		The Spirits are referring to Kardec’s extensive studies of magnetism to which he dedicated
53

  himself before Spiritism. – Tr.

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


        mind reading, empathetic transmission of pain, etc. Thus, it cannot
        be doubted that such individuals-in-crisis are in a type of awakened
        somnambulistic state caused by the influence they exert on one
        another. They are both magnetizers and magnetized at the same
        time without even realizing it.

483.   What is the cause of the physical insensitivity displayed both
       among certain convulsionaries and among other individuals
       submitted to the most atrocious tortures?
       “Among some, it is an exclusively magnetic effect,
       acting on the nervous system in the same manner as
       certain substances. Among others, the exaltation of
       thought deadens sensitivity because life seems to have
       withdrawn from the body in order to be transferred
       to the spirit. Don’t you know that when the spirit is
       intensely concerned with something, the body does not
       feel, hear or see?”
        In cases of torture, fanatic exaltation and enthusiasm often offer
        an example of calmness and cool-bloodedness, in which acute pain
        could not have been overcome unless one were to accept the fact
        that sensitivity had been neutralized by some kind of anesthetic
        effect. We know that frequently, in the heat of combat, a grave
        wound is often not felt at all, whereas under normal circumstances
        an ordinary scratch causes tears.
        Since these phenomena depend on a physical cause and the action
        of certain spirits, one may ask how, in some cases, it rested on
        civil authorities to put a stop to them. The reason is simple. The
        action of spirits here is secondary; they do nothing more than take
        advantage of a natural disposition. The authorities did not suppress
        the disposition itself, but rather the cause that maintained and
        excited it – which then went from active to latent. They had reason
        to act this way because the event resulted in abuse and scandal. We
        know, furthermore, that such intervention is powerless when the
        action of spirits is direct and spontaneous.

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


        The Affection of Certain Spirits
             for Certain Persons
484.   Do spirits affectionately prefer certain persons?
       “Good spirits sympathize with moral individuals or those
       who are susceptible to improving themselves; low order
       spirits, with wicked individuals or those who may become
       such. Hence, their affection is the result of a similarity of
       sentiment.”
485.   Is the affection of spirits for certain persons exclusively moral?
       “True affection has nothing carnal about it, but when a
       spirit attaches itself to a particular person, it is not always
       out of affection. A remembrance of human passions can
       have a hand in it.”
486.   Do spirits take an interest in our misfortunes and prosperity?
       Are those who wish us well concerned about the afflictions we
       experience in life?
       “Good spirits do all the good they can and they feel happy
       for your joys. They are concerned about your afflictions
       when you do not bear them with resignation, because then
       they produce no good results for you; you carry on like
       patients who reject the bitter medicine meant to heal them.”
487.   What kind of afflictions cause spirits to be concerned about us
       most: physically-caused afflictions or morally-caused ones?
       “Your selfishness and hard heartedness: everything else
       derives from these. They smile at all your imaginary ills
       born from pride and ambition, but they rejoice in those
       that will shorten the length of your trial.”
         Knowing that corporeal life is only transitory and that the
         tribulations accompanying it are the means leading to a better state,


                                   305

                          Part Two – Chapter IX


          spirits are more concerned about the moral causes that keep us from
          that state than about physical ills, which are only temporary.
          Spirits care little about misfortunes that only affect our mundane
          ideas, as we care little about the puerile afflictions of childhood.
          Spirits who see in the afflictions of life a means for our advancement
          consider them as a momentary crisis that will restore us to health.
          They commiserate in our sufferings just as we commiserate in the
          sufferings of a friend; but seeing things from a more correct point
          of view, they regard them differently. While good spirits rebuild our
          courage for the sake of our future, others incite us to desperation
          and try to jeopardize us.

488.    Do our relatives and friends who have preceded us into the
        other life have more sympathy for us than spirits who are
        strangers?
        “Of course, and as spirits they frequently protect you
        according to their power.”
        – Are they sensitive to our affections for them?
        “Very sensitive, but they forget those who forget them.”


       Guardian Angels: Protector, Familiar
            and Sympathetic Spirits
489.    Are there spirits who link themselves to particular individuals
        in order to protect them?
        “Yes, spirit friends; what you call good spirits or guardian
        spirits.”
490.    What is a guardian angel?
        “A protector spirit of a high order.”
491.    What is the mission of protector spirits?


                                    306

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       “Their mission is that of parents toward their children:
       to guide their wards along the path of the good, to
       help them with their counsels, to console them in their
       afflictions and to sustain their courage in the trials of
       earthly life.”
492.   Are protector spirits connected to particular individuals
       from birth?
       “From birth to death. They frequently accompany them
       after death in the spirit life and even through numerous
       corporeal existences, because these existences are no more
       than very short phases in the life of a spirit.”
493.   Is the mission of a protector spirit voluntary or obligatory?
       “The spirit is obliged to watch over you because it has
       accepted the task; however, it is allowed to choose beings
       who are attuned to it. For some, it is a pleasure; for others,
       a mission or a duty.”
       – In linking itself to an individual, does the spirit refrain
       from protecting other individuals?
       “No, but it does so less exclusively.”
494.   Is the protector spirit indissolubly connected to the person who
       has been entrusted into its care?
       “Certain spirits often leave their position to carry out
       different assignments, but in such cases they are replaced.”
495.   Do protector spirits sometimes abandon their ward when the
       latter is heedless of their warnings?
       “They withdraw when they see that their counsels are
       useless, and that the ward’s will is set on submitting to the
       influence of little-evolved spirits. They do not abandon
       them entirely, however, and always try to make themselves


                                  307

                Part Two – Chapter IX


heard. Their wards are the ones who shut their ears. Their
protectors return as soon as they are called.
“If there is a doctrine that should convert the most
incredulous by its charm and sweetness, it is that of
guardian angels. Isn’t it a very consoling idea to know that
you always have at your side beings who are more evolved
than you, who are always there to counsel, sustain and aid
you in scaling the rugged mountain of the good, who are
more reliable and devoted friends than the most intimate
connections that may be contracted on earth? These beings
are there at God’s orders. It was God who has placed them
at your side; they are there out of love for God and they
fulfill a beautiful but laborious mission alongside you.
Wherever you may be, your angel will be there with you:
in prison, in the hospital, in dens of iniquity, in solitude;
nothing separates you from that friend whom you cannot
see, but from whom your soul nonetheless receives the
gentlest impulses and hears the wisest counsels.
“Why can’t you understand this truth more fully! How many
times it would help you in moments of crisis; how many
times it would save you from evil spirits! But on the great
day of accounting, this angel of the good might have to say
to you, ‘Didn’t I offer you advice? Yet, you did not follow
it! Didn’t I show you the abyss? Yet, you fell into it! Didn’t
I make the voice of truth resound in your conscience, yet
you followed the counsels of a lie instead?’ Question your
guardian angels. Establish between yourselves and them
that intimate tenderness that reigns between best friends.
Do not think of hiding anything from them, for they are
the eyes of God and you cannot deceive them. Consider
the future. Seek to progress in this life, and your trials will
be shorter and your lives happier. Come; take heart! Once


                         308

   The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


and for all, avoid prejudices and ulterior motives! Enter
upon the new pathway now opening before you! Forward,
forward! You have guides; follow them. Your goal cannot
fail you, for the goal is God.
“To those who think it impossible that truly high order
spirits could devote themselves to such a laborious task
and at all instants, we will say that we can indeed influence
your souls, even though millions of miles may separate
us. Space does not exist to us, and even while living on
another world, our spirits retain a connection with you.
We enjoy faculties that you cannot comprehend; however,
you can be certain that God has not imposed a task on
us that is above our strength, or that God has abandoned
you alone on the earth without friends or support. All
guardian angels have their wards, whom they watch over
as parents watch over their children. They feel happy when
they see them on the path of the good but mourn when
their counsels are despised.
“Do not fear tiring us with your questions; rather, remain
in contact with us always: you will thus be stronger and
happier. These communications between each indivi­dual
and his or her familiar spirit are what make all individuals
mediums – mediums ignored today but who will show
themselves later, spreading out like an ocean without
shores to sweep away disbelief and ignorance. People of
learning, teach; people of talent, educate your brothers
and sisters! Without knowing it, the work you accomplish
is Christ’s work, which God has imposed on you. Why
has God granted you intelligence and knowledge if not to
share them with your brothers and sisters to enable them
to progress on the path of joy and eternal blessedness?”
                                      St. Louis, St. Augustine

                          309

                         Part Two – Chapter IX


         The doctrine of guardian angels watching over their wards, in spite
         of the distance separating the worlds, has nothing surprising about
         it; on the contrary, it is grand and sublime. On the earth, do we not
         often see a father, albeit far away, watch over his child and aid him
         or her with his wise counsels through correspondence? Why should
         we wonder that there are spirits who, from one world to the other,
         are able to guide those whom they have taken under their protection,
         since to them the distance separating the two worlds is less than that
         separating the continents on the earth? Do they not have the universal
         fluid that connects all worlds, uniting them in solidarity with one
         another, an immense vehicle for the transmission of thought, as the
         air is for us the vehicle for the transmission of sound?

496.   Can spirits who abandon their wards and no longer do them
       good do them evil instead?
       “Good spirits never do evil. They leave that to those
       who take their place, and then you blame fate for the
       misfortunes that overwhelm you, whereas you yourselves
       are actually to blame.”
497.   Can protector spirits leave their wards at the mercy of spirits
       who might harm them?
       “There is unity among evil spirits for neutralizing the
       action of the good ones, but if wards would so desire, they
       could restore the link to their good spirit. The good spirit
       may find a more willing person somewhere else to help in
       the meantime while awaiting its ward to return.”
498.   When protector spirits allow their wards to be led astray in life,
       is it because they are powerless to confront malevolent spirits?
       “It is not because they are powerless, but because they do not
       want to. Their wards emerge from their trials more evolved
       and more learned. Their protector spirits assist them with
       their counsels through the good thoughts they suggest but
       which, unfortunately, are not always heeded. It is nothing


                                   310

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       but human weakness, carelessness or pride that grants power
       to evil spirits. Their power over you comes solely from the
       fact that you do not offer them any resistance.”
499.   Are protector spirits with their wards all the time? Aren’t
       there circumstances where they may lose sight of them without
       abandoning them?
       “There are circumstances in which the presence of the
       protector spirit next to its ward is not necessary.”
500.   Does a time come in which a spirit no longer needs its
       guardian angel?
       “Yes, when it reaches the level at which it can guide itself,
       just as the time comes in which the student no longer
       needs the master. But this does not happen on the earth.”
501.   Why is the action of spirits in our lives so secretive? When they
       are protecting us, why don’t they do so openly?
       “If you counted on their support all the time, you would
       not act by yourselves and your spirit would not progress.
       In order for it to advance, it needs experience and it
       must be acquired at its own expense. It must exert its
       own volition; otherwise, it would be like an infant who
       is not allowed to walk by itself. The action of the spirits
       who wish you well always occurs in such a way so as not
       to hamper your free will, for if you did not have any
       responsibility, you would not progress on the path that
       must lead you toward God. Since they do not see who
       is helping them, humans rely on their own efforts. Their
       guides watch over them nevertheless and from time to
       time warn them of danger.”
502.   Do the protector spirits who succeed in leading their ward
       along the path of the good experience any good for themselves?


                                  311

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


       “It is a merit that will be taken into account, whether for
       their advancement or their happiness. They feel happy
       when they see their efforts crowned with success. It is a
       triumph for them, as when a mentor exults at the success
       of his or her disciple.”
       – Are they responsible if their efforts are unsuccessful?
       “No, because they have done all they could.”
503.   Don’t protector spirits suffer when they see their wards
       following an immoral path in spite of their warning, and
       isn’t it a cause of distress for them?
       “They suffer from their wards’ misdeeds and they pity
       them, but this affliction has none of the anguish of earthly
       parenthood, because they know that there is a remedy for the
       evil and that what is not done today will be done tomorrow.”
504.   Could we ever know the name of our protector spirit or
       guardian angel?
       “Why do you want to know names that do not exist for
       you? Do you believe there are only spirits with whom you
       are familiar?”
       – But how can we invoke it if we do not know its name?
       “Give it any name you please: that of a high order spirit for
       whom you have sympathy or veneration. Your protector
       will answer to that name, for all good spirits are kin and
       mutually assist each other.”
505.   Are protector spirits who employ well-known names always
       those of the actual individuals who had those names?
       “No, but they are spirits who are sympathetic to them,
       and who often come at their orders. You require a name;
       therefore, they employ one that will inspire your trust.


                                 312

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       When you cannot personally carry out a mission, you send
       someone whom you trust and who acts in your name.”
506.   When we return to the spirit life, will we recognize our
       protector spirit?
       “Yes, because you frequently knew it before your
       incarnation.”
507.   Do protector spirits all belong to the order of highly evolved
       spirits? Can they sometimes be found among average orders? Can
       a father, for example, become the protector spirit of his child?
       “He can, but protection presupposes a certain degree of
       elevation, and additionally, a power or virtue granted
       by God. A father who protects his child may himself be
       assisted by a more evolved spirit.”
508.   Can spirits who have left the earth under good circumstances always
       protect those whom they loved and who have survived them?
       “Their power is more or less restricted. The position in
       which they find themselves does not always allow them
       full freedom of action.”
509.   Do humans in the primitive state or in the state of moral
       impurity also have protector spirits? If so, are these spirits of
       an order as elevated as those of more advanced humans?
       “All individuals have a spirit who watches over them,
       but such a mission is relative to its purpose. You do
       not give a professor of philosophy to a child who is
       just learning to read. The progress of the familiar spirit
       follows that of the spirit it protects. Having a highly
       evolved spirit who watches over you, you in turn may
       become the protector of a spirit who is less evolved than
       you, and the progress you help that spirit make will
       contribute to your own advancement. God does not


                                  313

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


       require of a spirit more than what its nature and the
       degree at which it has arrived will allow.”
510.   When a father who has been watching over his child
       reincarnates, does he still continue to do so?
       “That is a more difficult situation, but in a moment of
       freedom he may ask that a sympathetic spirit assist him
       in this mission. However, spirits only accept missions that
       they can carry out to the end.
       “Incarnate spirits, especially on worlds where existence is
       quite material, are too dominated by their physical body
       to be able to devote themselves entirely to others; that is,
       to assist them personally. That is why those who are not
       sufficiently evolved are themselves assisted by spirits who
       are more evolved, so that if one fails, for whatever reason,
       it will be replaced by another.”
511.   Besides our protector spirit, is an evil spirit connected to
       each one of us for the purpose of leading us into evil and for
       providing us an opportunity to struggle with good and evil?
       “Connected is not the right term. It is certainly true that evil
       spirits try to draw individuals away from the moral road
       when they find the opportunity. However, when one of
       them connects itself to an individual, it does so of its own
       accord because it hopes to be listened to. This gives rise to
       a struggle between the good and the evil spirit, and the one
       whose influence the individual has heeded will win.”
512.   May we have several protector spirits?
       “All individuals always have sympathetic spirits who are
       more advanced or less so, who dedicate their affection
       to them and who take an interest in them; there are also
       those who help them in evil.”


                                314

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


513.   Do sympathetic spirits act in virtue of a mission?
       “Sometimes they may have a temporary mission, but
       generally they are only attracted due to a similarity of
       thought and sentiment in good or evil.”
       – So it is correct to assume that sympathetic spirits may be
       either good or evil?
       “Yes, humans will always encounter spirits who sympathize
       with them, whatever their character may be.”
514.   Are familiar spirits the same as sympathetic spirits or protector
       spirits?
       “There are many, many gradations of protection and
       sympathy. Give to them whatever names you desire. The
       familiar spirit, however, is usually a friend of the home.”
         From the above explanations and from observations made about the
         nature of spirits who connect themselves to human beings, we may
         deduce the following:
         Protector spirits, guardian angels or good spirits are those whose
         mission is to follow humans during life and to help them progress.
         They are always more highly evolved than their ward.
         Familiar spirits link themselves to certain persons by means of ties
         of varying duration in order to help them according to their power,
         which is frequently quite limited, however. These are good spirits, but
         sometimes little-advanced and even a little frivolous. They voluntarily
         occupy themselves with the details of an individual’s personal life, and
         only act by order or with permission of protector spirits.
         Sympathetic spirits are those whom we attract to us through
         individual affections and a certain similarity in tastes and sentiments,
         both in good and in evil. The duration of their relationship almost
         always depends on the circumstances.
         Evil spirits are imperfect or wicked spirits who attach themselves to
         individuals for the purpose of diverting them from the good, but



                                    315

                          Part Two – Chapter IX


         they behave at their own impulse and not in virtue of a mission.
         Their tenacity is directly related to how easy or difficult their access
         to the person is, and individuals are always free to listen to their
         voice or to repel them.

515.   What should be thought of persons who seem to attach
       themselves to others in order to lead them inevitably into
       perdition, or on the other hand, to guide them along the path
       of the good?
       “Some persons exert a certain effect on others; they hold
       a kind of spell over them that seems irresistible. When
       this happens for evil, they are in fact evil spirits whom
       other evil spirits employ in order to better subjugate their
       victims. God may permit this in order to test them.”
516.   Could our good spirit or an evil one incarnate in order to
       follow us more directly in life?
       “This sometimes happens, but they frequently entrust this
       task to incarnate spirits who are sympathetic with them.”
517.   Are there spirits who attach themselves to an entire family in
       order to protect it?
       “Some spirits link themselves to the members of the same
       family, who live together and are united by affection;
       however, do not believe in spirit protectors of race pride.”
518.   Since spirits are attracted to individuals out of sympathy, are they
       attracted to groups of individuals for particular reasons as well?
       “Spirits prefer places where they can be amongst those
       who are like themselves. In such places, they can be more
       at ease and surer of being listened to. Humans attract
       spirits because of their tendencies, whether as individuals,
       as a collective group, a city or a nation. Thus, there are
       societies, cities and nations that are assisted by spirits
       of greater or lesser advancement, depending on their

                                    316

          The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       character and the passions that dominate them. Since
       imperfect spirits withdraw from those who repel them, the
       moral purity of a collective whole, like that of individuals,
       tends to repel evil spirits and attract good ones. The latter
       awaken and maintain a sense of the good in the masses,
       in the same way that the former may inspire in them the
       worst passions.”
519.   Do groups of individuals such as societies, cities and nations
       have their own special protector spirits?
       “Yes, because such groups are collective individualities
       that are headed toward a common objective and therefore
       have the need of higher direction.”
520.   Are the protector spirits of groups of a more advanced nature
       than those who are linked to individuals?
       “Everything is relative to the degree of advancement,
       whether of groups or of individuals.”
521.   May certain spirits help the arts to progress by watching over
       those involved in them?
       “There are special protector spirits who assist those who
       invoke them, and whom they deem worthy. But what could
       you expect them to do for those who deem themselves to
       be something, which, in fact, they are not? They cannot
       make the blind see or the deaf hear.”
        The ancients made special deities of such spirits. The Muses were
        the allegorical personification of the protector spirits of the arts
        and sciences, just as the family protector spirits were designated by
        the names of lares and penates. Among moderns, the arts and the
        various industries, cities and countries also have their own patrons
        or protectors, who are high order spirits, but under other names.
        Since all individuals have their own sympathetic spirits, it thus
        follows that in all collective groups the overall quality of the


                                  317

                         Part Two – Chapter IX


        sympathetic spirits corresponds to the overall quality of the
        individuals composing them, and that foreign spirits are attracted
        to such groups out of similarity of tastes and thoughts. In other
        words, these groups, as well as the individuals comprising them,
        are more favorably surrounded by protector spirits or they are less
        surrounded by them, and they are assisted and influenced according
        to the nature of the thoughts of the majority.
        Among nations, the causes that attract spirits are their customs,
        habits, their dominant character, and above all, their laws, for the
        character of a nation is reflected in its laws. Humans who ensure
        that justice reigns among them combat the influence of evil spirits.
        Wherever laws consecrate injustices that are contrary to humanity,
        good spirits are in the minority and a mass of evil ones flood in,
        keeping the people of that nation stuck in their ideas and paralyzing
        the occasional good influences, which become lost in the crowd
        like isolated stalks of corn in the midst of weeds. By studying the
        customs of nations or of any group of individuals, it is therefore easy
        to get an idea of the invisible population that is meddling in their
        thoughts and actions.



                        Presentiments
522.   Is a presentiment always a warning from a protector spirit?
       “A presentiment can be the inner and secret counsel of
       a spirit who wishes you well. It can also be an intuition
       about a choice made prior to incarnation – it is the voice
       of instinct. Before incarnating, a spirit has knowledge of
       the principal phases of its coming existence, i.e. the kind
       of trials in which it will be engaged. When these are of
       a marked character, it preserves a type of impression in
       its inner consciousness, and this impression – the voice
       of instinct – awakens when the moment arrives. It then
       becomes a presentiment.”


                                   318

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


523.   Presentiments and the voice of instinct are always somewhat
       vague. What should we do when we are uncertain?
       “When in doubt, invoke your good spirit or pray to God,
       our supreme Creator, to send you a divine messenger: one of us.”
524.   Do the warnings of our protector spirits have our moral
       conduct as their sole objective, or our conduct regarding the
       things of our private life as well?
       “Everything. They seek to enable you to live in the best
       way possible, but you frequently shut your ears to their
       good warnings and you thus make yourselves unhappy
       through your own fault.”
         Our protector spirits help us with their counsels through the
         voice of conscience, which they make resound in our inner being.
         However, since we do not always give them the importance they
         deserve, they offer us more direct counsels by using the persons
         around us. Examine the various happy or unhappy circumstances
         of your life and you will see that on many occasions you received
         counsels, which you did not always take advantage of, but which
         would have saved you much trouble if you had listened to them.



The Influence of Spirits on the Events of Life
525.   Do spirits exert any influence on the events of life?
       “Certainly, because they counsel you.”
       – Do they exert this influence in any other way besides the thoughts
       they suggest? Do they act directly in the outcome of things?
       “Yes, but they never act outside natural laws.”
         We erroneously think that the action of spirits must only manifest
         through extraordinary phenomena. We would like for them to
         come to our aid through miracles, and we always imagine them



                                  319

                          Part Two – Chapter IX


         to be armed with some kind of magic wand. But such is not the
         case. Rather, their intervention always appears veiled and what is
         accomplished through their concourse seems entirely natural. Thus,
         for example, they cause the meeting of two persons who seem to
         have met by accident; they inspire someone with the thought of
         passing by such and such a place; they call a person’s attention to a
         specific point if it will lead to the result they desire; thus, they work
         in such a way that individuals, believing they have only followed
         their own impulse, always retain their free will.

526.   Since spirits can act upon matter, can they cause certain effects
       with the aim of producing a given outcome? For example, a
       man’s time is up; he climbs a ladder, the ladder breaks and he
       dies from the fall. Did spirits cause the ladder to break so that
       the man’s fate would be fulfilled?
       “It is certainly true that spirits have an influence on
       matter, but in order to fulfill the laws of nature and not to
       derogate from them by causing an unexpected event at a
       given moment and contrary to such laws. In the example
       you have just mentioned, the ladder breaks because it is
       rotten or because it is not strong enough to support the
       man’s weight. If it were the man’s fate to die in this way,
       spirits would inspire him with the thought of climbing the
       ladder, which would then break under his weight. Thus,
       his death would stem from a natural cause without the
       need for any kind of miracle.”
527.   Let us take another example, but one in which the natural state
       of matter does not intervene. A man is destined to die from
       lightning; he seeks refuge under a tree, lightning strikes it and
       he dies. Did spirits cause the lightning and direct it at him?
       “It is still the same thing. The lightning struck the tree at that
       particular moment because the event happened according
       to the laws of nature. The lightning was not directed at the
       tree because the man was under it, but because he was given

                                     320

          The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       the inspiration to take refuge under the tree where lightning
       would strike. The tree would have been struck anyway,
       whether the man had been under it or not.”
528.   An ill-intentioned man shoots at another but the bullet barely
       grazes him. Could a benevolent spirit have deflected the shot?
       “If the individual was not meant to be struck, the benevolent
       spirit may have inspired him with the thought of moving
       out of its path, or it may have confused his enemy in such
       a way as to make him miss. Once the bullet is on its way,
       however, it must follow the line of its trajectory.”
529.   What should be thought about magic bullets that are referred
       to in certain legends, and which fatality hit their mark?
       “Pure imagination. Humans delight in the marvelous but
       are not content with the marvels of nature.”
       – May the spirits who direct the events of life be thwarted by
       spirits who have desires to the contrary?
       “What God has willed must occur. If there is any delay or
       hindrance, it is the divine will.”
530.   Mightn’t frivolous and mocking spirits cause the little
       difficulties that undo our plans and upset our calculations? In
       other words, aren’t they the authors of what we commonly call
       the petty troubles of human life?
       “They take pleasure in such annoyances, which are trials
       for you and are meant to try your patience; but they
       stop when they see that nothing comes of it. However, it
       would neither be just nor correct to blame them for all
       your frustrations, of which you yourselves are the main
       authors through your own carelessness. Thus, if your
       dish breaks, it was probably due more to your clumsiness
       than the fault of spirits.”


                                 321

                        Part Two – Chapter IX


       – Do spirits who cause annoyances behave in such a manner
       as a result of personal animosity, or do they attack the first
       person whom they meet out of simple malice and without any
       set motive?
       “They act from both motives. Sometimes they are enemies
       whom you have made in this life or in a previous one, and
       who pursue you as a result. At other times there is no motive.”
531.   Is the rancor of the beings who have harmed us on earth
       extinguished with their corporeal life?
       “They often realize the injustice and the wrong they have
       done, but if God allows them, they will continue to pursue
       you in their hatred in order to test you further.”
       – Is there a way to put an end to it, and if so, by what means?
       “Yes, by praying for them and by paying back their evil
       with good. That way they will end up comprehending their
       errors. In all cases, if you know how to place yourselves
       above their schemes, they will cease them upon seeing
       they have gained nothing from them.”
         Experience has shown that certain spirits continue their vengeance
         from one existence to the next, and that sooner or later we will
         expiate the wrongs we may have caused someone.

532.   Do spirits have the power to divert misfortunes from certain
       persons and to attract prosperity to them instead?
       “Not entirely, because there are misfortunes that belong
       to the designs of Providence. Nevertheless, they can lessen
       your pain by giving you patience and resignation.
       “Also, be aware that it frequently depends on you yourselves
       to divert such misfortunes, or at least to mitigate them.
       God has given you intelligence so that you may use it,
       and it is especially in this way that spirits help you by


                                  322

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       suggesting favorable thoughts to you; but they only help
       those who know how to help themselves. That is the
       meaning of the words, ‘Seek and you will find; knock and
       it will be opened to you.’
       “Moreover, what looks like misfortune to you is not
       always such in reality. Frequently, something good will
       result from it that is far better, but that is what you do
       not comprehend because you think only of the present
       moment or of your own selves.”
533.   Can spirits enable us to obtain the gifts of fortune if we ask
       them to?
       “Sometimes, as a trial. Most often, however, they will refuse,
       just as you would refuse a child’s inconsiderate request.”
       – Are they good spirits or evil ones who grant such favors?
       “Either. It depends on their intention, but usually they are
       spirits who desire to lead you into evil, and who find an easy
       means of doing so in the pleasures that fortune provides.”
534.   When obstacles seem to fatally inflict our projects, is it because
       of the influence of some spirit?
       “It is sometimes because of the influence of a spirit; other
       times, and more frequently, it is because you yourselves
       have mismanaged your projects. Position and character
       have much to do with it, and if you persist in following a
       path that is not right for you, spirits have nothing to do
       with it – you yourselves become your own evil spirit.”
535.   When something fortunate happens to us, should we thank
       our protector spirit?
       “Above all, thank God, without whose permission nothing
       takes place; afterward, thank the good spirits, who were
       God’s agents.”

                                  323

                       Part Two – Chapter IX


       – What would happen if we forgot to thank them?
       “The same thing that always happens to ingrates.”
       – Nevertheless, there are many people who neither pray nor
       give thanks, but for whom everything turns out well anyway.
       “Yes, but it is necessary to see the end. They will pay
       dearly for this temporary undeserved happiness, for the
       more they have received, the more they will have to render
       account for it.”


           The Action of Spirits on the
             Phenomena of Nature
536.   Are the great phenomena of nature – those considered as
       perturbations of the elements – due to fortuitous causes or do
       they all have a providential purpose?
       “Everything has a reason for being and nothing occurs
       without God’s permission.”
       – Do these phenomena always have humankind as their
       objective?
       “Sometimes they occur for a reason directly related to
       humankind, but most frequently they have no other
       purpose than to reestablish the balance and harmony of
       the physical forces of nature.”
       – We understand perfectly well that God’s will is the primary
       cause in these as in all things. But since we know that spirits
       can in fact act upon matter and that they are agents of God’s
       will, we would ask whether some among them might not
       exert an influence over the elements in order to rouse, calm
       or direct them.


                                324

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       “But that is obvious; it cannot be otherwise. God does not
       act directly on nature, but has devoted agents on every
       degree of the worlds’ scales.”
537.   The mythology of the ancients is entirely based on Spiritist
       ideas, with the difference that they regarded spirits as deities,
       and they represented those gods or spirits as having special
       attributes. Thus, some were in charge of the wind; others, the
       lightning, while others presided over vegetation, etc. Is this
       belief entirely without foundation?
       “It is entirely without foundation and far from the truth.”
       – Along the same lines, are there spirits inhabiting the earth’s
       interior, presiding over geological phenomena?
       “Such spirits do not actually inhabit the earth, but
       they preside over and direct its phenomena according
       to their particular attributes. Someday, you will have
       an explanation for all these phenomena and you will
       comprehend them better.”
538.   Do the spirits who preside over the phenomena of nature form
       a special category in the spirit world? Are they separate beings,
       or are they spirits who have been incarnated like us?
       “Who will be or who have been.”
       – Do these spirits belong to the higher or lower orders of the
       spirit hierarchy?
       “That depends on whether their role is more material or
       intelligent, or less so: some command; others execute.
       Those who perform material functions are always of a
       lower order among spirits, just as among human beings.”
539.   In the production of certain phenomena – storms, for
       example – does a single spirit act, or do they gather en mass?



                                  325

                       Part Two – Chapter IX


       “In enormous masses.”
540.   Do the spirits who act upon the phenomena of nature do so
       with full awareness and in virtue of their free will, or out of
       an instinctive and unreasoning impulse?
       “Some in one way, others in the other. Let us make a
       comparison: consider the myriads of animals that little
       by little build up islands and archipelagos in the ocean.
       Do you believe that there is no providential purpose in
       this, and that this transformation of the surface of the
       globe is not necessary for its overall harmony? Yet, all
       this is accomplished by animals of the lowest degree
       while they are providing for their own needs and without
       perceiving that they are God’s instruments. In the same
       way, the least advanced spirits are useful to the general
       whole. While preparing for life, and before having full
       awareness of their acts and free will, they act upon certain
       phenomena in which they are the unwitting agents. At
       first, they execute; later, when their intelligence is more
       developed, they command and direct the matters of the
       material world. Still later, they direct the things of the
       moral world. Hence, everything is useful; everything
       in nature is linked together, from the primitive atom
       to the archangel, who also began as only an atom – an
       admirable law of harmony, which your limited minds
       cannot yet grasp in its entirety!”


                 Spirits during Battle
541.   During battle, are there spirits who assist in it and who aid
       each of the forces in the fight?
       “Yes, and who stimulate their courage.”


                                326

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


         Thus, the ancients represented the gods as taking the side of this or
         that people. Such gods were nothing more than spirits represented
         by allegorical figures.

542.   In war, justice is always on one side only. How can spirits
       support the one that is in the wrong?
       “You know perfectly well that there are spirits who seek
       only discord and destruction. For them war is war. The
       justness of the cause means little to them.”
543.   Can certain spirits influence generals in the conception of
       their plans for a particular campaign?
       “Absolutely. Spirits can influence them in this as in all
       conceptions.”
544.   Can evil spirits suggest faulty plans to them in order to lead
       them to defeat?
       “Yes, but don’t they have free will? If their judgment does
       not enable them to distinguish a good idea from a bad
       one, they will suffer the consequences and would do better
       at obeying than commanding.”
545.   Can generals sometimes be guided by a type of second sight,
       an intuitive perception that shows them the result of their
       strategies beforehand?
       “That is frequently what happens with geniuses. It is what
       they call inspiration and it enables them to act with a type
       of certainty. This inspiration comes to them from the
       spirits who guide them, and who use the faculties with
       which such individuals have been endowed.”
546.   In the heat of combat, what happens to the spirits of those who
       die? Are they still interested in the battle after death?
       “Some continue to be interested; others withdraw.”



                                   327

                          Part Two – Chapter IX


         The same thing happens in combat as occurs in all cases of violent
         death. At first, such spirits are surprised and bewildered. They do not
         believe they are dead and they think they are still taking part in the
         action. It is only little by little that reality imposes itself on them.

547.   After death, do the spirits of those who had fought each other
       while alive still regard one another as enemies and continue
       to be hostile toward each other?
       “In such moments, spirits are never calm. At first, they may
       still hate their enemy and even pursue them, but when
       they regain their composure, they see that their animosity
       no longer has any motive. Nevertheless, they may retain
       greater or lesser traces of it, depending on their character.”
       – Do they still hear the din of the battle?
       “Yes, perfectly.”
548.   Do spirits who calmly watch a battle as spectators witness
       the separation of soul from body? How does this phenomenon
       appear to them?
       “Very few deaths are truly instantaneous. Most of the time,
       a spirit whose body has been mortally wounded is not
       aware of it at the time. Only when consciousness begins
       to return can the spirit be seen moving beside its corpse.
       This appears so natural that the sight of the dead body
       lying there does not produce any disagreeable effect. All
       life having been transferred into the spirit, only the spirit
       attracts attention, and it is the spirit with whom spectators
       converse, or to whom they give orders.”


                                 Pacts
549.   Is there any kind of truth to pacts being formed with evil
       spirits?

                                    328

          The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       “No, there are no such pacts. However, an evil nature
       may be attuned to evil spirits. For example: you want
       to torment your neighbor, but you do not know how to
       proceed. Thus, you call low order spirits who, like you,
       desire only evil. In return for their help, they want you to
       help them in their own evil designs. However, this does
       not mean that your neighbor cannot be freed from them
       by an opposing appeal or by an action of the will. Those
       who desire to commit an act of evil, simply for the sake
       of committing evil, call evil spirits to their aid, and then
       become obliged to serve them in turn because these spirits
       need them for the evil they themselves desire to do. It is
       only in this that a pact consists.”
        The fact that persons sometimes find themselves dependent on low
        order spirits proceeds from their delivering themselves over to the
        evil thoughts that such spirits suggest to them, and not from any
        kind of stipulations made between them. A pact, in the usual sense
        of the word, is an allegory that portrays an evil nature sympathizing
        with equally wicked spirits.

550.   What is the meaning of the fantastic fables according to which
       certain individuals have sold their soul to Satan in exchange
       for certain favors?
       “All fables contain a teaching and a moral; your error is in
       taking them literally. This one is an allegory that may be
       explained like this: those who call evil spirits to help them
       obtain the gifts of fortune or any other favor rebel against
       Providence. They renounce the mission they have received
       and the trials they must undergo in this world, but they
       will reap the consequences of it in the life to come. This
       does not mean their soul is condemned to suffer forever.
       However, instead of detaching themselves from matter,
       they immerse themselves deeper and deeper in it. The joys
       they have preferred on earth will no longer be available to

                                  329

                       Part Two – Chapter IX


       them in the spirit world until they atone for their wrong
       through new trials that will perhaps be even greater and
       more painful. Out of love for material pleasures, they place
       themselves under the power of impure spirits. Hence, they
       tacitly establish a mutual pact which leads them to ruin,
       but which will always be easy for them to break with the
       assistance of good spirits if they firmly desire to do so.”


       Occult Power, Talismans, Sorcerers
551.   Can evil individuals, with the aid of evil spirits to whom they
       are devoted, cause harm to their neighbor?
       “No, God would not permit it.”
552.   What is to be thought of the belief that certain individuals
       can cast spells?
       “Some persons possess a very strong magnetic power,
       which they may use for evil if their own spirit is evil. In
       that case, they could be aided by other evil spirits. But do
       not believe in the fake magical power that exists only in
       the imagination of superstitious people who are ignorant
       of the true laws of nature. The events they cite are natural
       events poorly observed, and above all, poorly understood.”
553.   What may be the effect of formulas and practices with which
       certain persons claim to control the wills of spirits?
       “That of making them look ridiculous if they are of good
       faith; if not, they are rogues who deserve punishment.
       All such formulas are mere charlatanism. There is no
       sacramental word, no cabalistic sign, no talisman that has
       any power over spirits, because they are only attracted by
       thought and not by material objects.”


                                330

           The Intervention of Spirits in the Corporeal World


       – Haven’t certain spirits sometimes dictated cabalistic formulas?
       “Yes, there are spirits who indicate signs and bizarre words
       to you, or who prescribe certain acts to you with the help
       of those who aid you in performing what you call spell-
       casting. Nevertheless, you may be very sure that these
       spirits are mocking you and abusing your credulity.”
554.   Isn’t it possible that those who rightly or wrongly trust in what
       they call the virtue of a talisman may attract a spirit by such
       trust since it is their thought that acts, whereas the talisman is
       only a sign that helps to direct the thought?
       “That is the case, but the nature of the spirit attracted by
       such means depends on the purity of the intention and
       the level of the sentiments. But it is rare for those who
       are simple enough to believe in the virtue of a talisman
       not to have a material objective rather than a moral one.
       Whatever the case may be, this implies a narrowness
       and weakness of mind that gives access to imperfect and
       mocking spirits.”
555.   What are sorcerers?
       “When they are of good faith, those whom you call
       sorcerers are persons who possess certain faculties such
       as magnetic power or second-sight. Since they do things
       that you do not comprehend, you suppose them to be
       endowed with supernatural power. Haven’t your learned
       individuals often been mistaken for sorcerers in the eyes
       of the ignorant?”
         Spiritism and magnetism give us the key to an infinite number of
         phenomena, about which ignorance has woven many fables and in
         which the facts have been greatly exaggerated by the imagination.
         A clear knowledge of these two sciences – which are actually but
         one – showing the reality of things and their true cause is the best
         protection against superstitious ideas because they reveal what is


                                   331

                         Part Two – Chapter IX


         possible and what is impossible, what is within the laws of nature,
         and what is no more than a foolish belief.

556.   Do certain individuals really possess the gift of healing by
       simple touch?
       “Their magnetic power may act to that extent when it is
       aided by purity of sentiments and an ardent desire to do
       good, for then good spirits come to their aid. It is necessary,
       however, to distrust the way stories are told by very gullible
       or enthusiastic individuals, who are always ready to see the
       miraculous in the simplest and most natural things. One
       must always distrust the self-interested claims of persons
       who exploit credulity for their own profit.”


                  Blessings and Curses
557.   Can blessings and curses attract good or evil to those at whom
       they are aimed?
       “God does not listen to unjust curses, and those who utter
       them are guilty before God. Since we have two opposing
       tendencies – good and evil – there may be a momentary
       influence in these cases, even upon matter. This influence
       never occurs, however, without God’s permission and as
       an increase in the trial for the one at whom it is aimed.
       Besides, most frequently, curses are usually aimed at the
       wicked, while blessings are aimed at the morally upright.
       Blessings or curses can never divert Providence from the
       path of justice. Providence does not strike those who are
       cursed unless they are wicked, and its protection does not
       cover those who do not deserve it.”

          Occupations and
          Missions of Spirits
558.   Do spirits have any other duty besides their own personal
       improvement?
       “They concur in the harmony of the universe and act as
       ministers in fulfilling God’s will. Spirit life is a continuous
       occupation, but it is not at all arduous like that of earth,
       because it is not subject to bodily fatigue or the anguish
       of need.”
559.   Do less evolved spirits also perform a useful role in the universe?
       “All have duties to fulfill. Doesn’t the least of masons
       concur in the construction of a building as much as the
       does the architect?” (See no. 540)
560.   Does each spirit have special attributes?
       “It is worth stating that we all must inhabit all places
       and must acquire knowledge of all things, successively
       presiding over functions involving all the planes of the
       universe. However, as Ecclesiastes states, there is a time
       for everything. Thus, one spirit is currently fulfilling its
       destiny on this world, while another will accomplish or
       has already accomplished its destiny at another time, on
       the earth, in the water, in the air, etc.”

                                  333

                         Part Two – Chapter X


561.   Are the functions that spirits perform in the order of things
       permanent for each spirit, and do such functions belong
       exclusively to the attributes of certain orders?
       “All spirits must ascend the various degrees of the scale in
       order to perfect themselves. Since God is just, God could
       not have given knowledge without effort to some, while
       others acquired it only in a painful manner.”
         Likewise, among humans, no one reaches the supreme degree of
         skill in any art without having acquired the necessary knowledge by
         practicing the most elementary functions of that art.

562.   Since spirits of the most advanced order have nothing more to
       acquire, are they in a state of absolute repose, or do they still
       have occupations?
       “What do you think they are doing for all eternity? Eternal
       idleness would be eternal torture.”
       – What is the nature of their occupations?
       “Receiving orders directly from God, transmitting them
       throughout the universe and supervising their execution.”
563.   Are the occupations of spirits unceasing?
       “Unceasing, yes, if we understand that their thought is
       always active, for they live by thought. Yet, one must not
       equate their occupations with the material occupations of
       humans. Their very activity is a delight because they know
       they are being useful.”
       – That is understandable for good spirits, but does the same
       apply to less evolved ones?
       “Less evolved spirits have occupations suitable for
       their nature. Would you entrust the works of cultured
       individuals to manual laborers?”



                                  334

                  Occupations and Missions of Spirits


564.   Are there among spirits those who are idle, or who do not
       occupy themselves with anything useful?
       “Yes, but it is temporary and depends on the development
       of their intelligence. Certainly, as among humans, there
       are those who live only for themselves. Such idleness
       nonetheless weighs on them, and sooner or later the desire
       to progress stirs the need for activity, and they are glad
       to make themselves useful once again. We are speaking
       of spirits who have arrived at the necessary point of self-
       consciousness and free will, for at their origin they are like
       new-born children who act more from instinct than from
       a determined will.”
565.   Do spirits examine our works of art and take an interest in them?
       “They examine anything that may indicate the elevation
       of spirits and their progress.”
566.   Does a spirit who had a specialty on earth – a painter or
       architect, for example – take a special interest in the works
       that were the object of its predilection during life?
       “Everything blends into an overall objective. If the spirit
       is good, it will take an interest in them to the degree that
       they enable it to help with the evolution of souls toward
       God. Besides, you are forgetting that spirits who practiced
       an art during the lifetime in which you knew them could
       have practiced another in a previous lifetime, because
       it is necessary for them to know everything in order to
       perfect themselves. Thus, according to their degree of
       advancement, it might be that nothing constitutes a
       specialty for them. This is what I meant when I stated
       that everything blends into an overall objective. Also, be
       aware of this: what is sublime to you in your backward
       world is no more than child’s play when compared with


                                 335

                         Part Two – Chapter X


       what exists on more advanced worlds. Why would you
       suppose that the spirits who inhabit those worlds, where
       there are arts unknown to you, would admire what would
       appear to them as no more than the work of a school
       child? As I have already stated: they examine whatever
       may indicate progress.”
       – We understand why such must be the case with highly
       advanced spirits, but we are speaking about more commonplace
       spirits who have not yet raised themselves above earthly ideas.
       “Their case is different. Their point of view is more limited
       and they may admire what you yourselves admire.”
567.   Do spirits sometimes meddle in our occupations and pleasures?
       “Commonplace spirits, as you call them, yes. They are
       unceasingly around you and at times take a very active
       part in all that you do, according to their nature. It is
       good that they do so in order to drive men and women
       forward in their different walks of life, exciting or
       moderating their passions.”
         Spirits occupy themselves with the things of this world according
         to whether they are more evolved or less so. High order spirits
         undoubtedly have the ability to consider them in minutest detail,
         but they only do so to the degree that it is useful to progress. Low
         order spirits only attach an importance to such things in proportion
         to the remembrances that are still present in their memory, and to
         material ideas that are not yet extinct.

568.   Do spirits who have missions to fulfill do so while in the errant
       or incarnate state?
       “They may do so in either state. For certain errant spirits,
       it is a great occupation.”
569.   What do the missions that may be entrusted to errant spirits
       entail?


                                   336

                  Occupations and Missions of Spirits


       “They are so varied that it would be impossible to describe
       them. Besides, there are those that you would not be able
       to comprehend. Spirits fulfill the will of God, and you are
       not able to grasp all the divine designs.”
         Spirits’ missions always have the good as their purpose. Whether as
         a spirit or as a human, they are in charge of helping the progress of
         humankind, nations or individuals within a varying range of ideas
         that may be more specialized or less so in order to prepare the way
         for certain events and to oversee the accomplishment of certain
         things. Some have more restricted missions of a certain personal
         or entirely localized manner, such as helping the sick, the dying
         and the afflicted, and as guides, watching over those who are under
         their protection and directing them with their counsels or the good
         thoughts they suggest. One could say that there are as many kinds of
         missions as there are kinds of interests to watch over, whether in the
         material realm or in the moral realm. A spirit advances according to
         how well it has performed its duty.

570.   Do spirits always comprehend the designs that they are charged
       with executing?
       “No. There are those who are blind instruments, while
       others know fully well the purpose for which they act.”
571.   Are advanced spirits the only ones who have missions to fulfill?
       “A mission’s importance is in relation to the spirit’s ability
       and elevation. The courier who carries a dispatch also
       fulfills a mission, though it is not that of a general.”
572.   Is the mission of a spirit imposed on it or does it depend on
       its will?
       “A spirit asks for it and is happy to receive it.”
       – May the same mission be requested by several spirits?
       “Yes, there are always several candidates but not all are
       accepted.”


                                   337

                         Part Two – Chapter X


573.   What does the mission of incarnate spirits entail?
       “Instructing human beings, helping them to advance,
       and improving their institutions by direct and material
       means. Missions are of various degrees of generality and
       importance, however: the one who cultivates the soil
       fulfills a mission as surely as the one who rules or teaches.
       Everything in nature is linked together. At the same time
       in which a spirit is purifying itself through incarnation, it
       is also working to fulfill the designs of Providence. Each
       one has its mission in this world because each one can be
       useful for something.”
574.   What could be the earthly mission of intentionally useless persons?
       “There really are persons who live only for themselves and who
       do not know how to make themselves useful for anything.
       They are poor beings whom we should pity because they
       will painfully expiate their intentional uselessness, and their
       chastisement frequently begins even in this world through
       weariness and dissatisfaction with life.”
       – Since they had the right to choose, why did they prefer a life
       that could not be of any use to them?
       “Among spirits there are lazy ones who recoil before a life
       of work. God allows them to do so. They will understand
       the inappropriateness of their uselessness later and at their
       own expense, and they will be the first to ask to make
       up for lost time. Also, they had perhaps chosen a more
       useful life to begin with, but once in action, they rejected
       it, allowing themselves to be misled by the suggestions of
       spirits who incited them to idleness.”
575.   Common occupations would seem to be duties rather than
       missions per se. According to the idea normally associated
       with the word, a mission has a sense of importance that is


                                  338

                  Occupations and Missions of Spirits


       less exclusive, and especially, less personal. From that point of
       view, how can we tell if persons have a real mission on earth?
       “By the great things they do and by the progress they
       enable their fellow beings to make.”
576.   Are those who have an important mission predestined for it
       before their birth, and do they have knowledge of it?
       “Yes, sometimes, but more often they are unaware of it.
       They only have a vague notion of it when they arrive on
       the earth. Their mission is traced out after their birth and
       according to circumstances as God drives them along the
       path on which they must fulfill the divine designs.”
577.   When individuals do something useful, is it always in virtue
       of a previous and predestined mission, or might they have
       received an unforeseen mission?
       “Not everything that individuals do is the consequence
       of a predestined mission. Instead, they are frequently the
       instrument a spirit uses in order to perform something
       it considers useful. For example, a certain spirit thinks
       it would be a good idea to write a book, which it would
       actually write if it were incarnate, so it seeks out the
       writer most capable of comprehending its thought
       and most capable of acting on it. It suggests the idea
       and directs its execution. Thus, this indi­vidual did not
       originally come to earth with the mission of doing this
       particular work. The same thing applies to certain works
       of art and discoveries. It should be further noted that
       during its body’s sleep, the incarnate spirit communicates
       directly with the discarnate one in order to discuss how
       the mission is to be carried out.”
578.   Can a spirit fail in its mission through its own fault?
       “Yes, if it is not a high order spirit.”

                        Part Two – Chapter X


       – What are the consequences for it?
       “It will have to start the work over – that is its punishment.
       Furthermore, it will suffer the consequences of the
       problems it has caused.”
579.   Since a spirit receives its mission from God, how could God
       entrust an important mission of general interest to a spirit
       who may fail?
       “Doesn’t God know whether his general will be victorious
       or defeated? Rest assured that it is so, and the divine plans,
       when important, do not rely on those who might abandon
       the work in the middle of it. The whole issue for you is the
       knowledge of the future, which God possesses, but which
       is not given to you.”
580.   Does a spirit who incarnates to fulfill a mission have the same
       apprehensions as the one who incarnates to undergo a trial?
       “No. It has experience.”
581.   Individuals who are the lights of humankind, those who
       enlighten humans with their genius, obviously have a mission.
       But amongst them are those who are mistaken, and who,
       instead of great truths, spread great errors. How should we
       regard their mission?
       “As having been falsified by them. They are beneath the
       task they have undertaken. However, it is necessary to
       take circumstances into account. Geniuses must speak
       according to the time in which they live. Thus, a teaching
       that appears erroneous or puerile to a later era may have
       been sufficient during its own time.”
582.   Can parenthood be considered a mission?
       “It is, without any doubt, a mission, and at the same
       time, a very great duty that involves parents more than


                                340

                  Occupations and Missions of Spirits


       they might think concerning their responsibility for the
       future. God has placed children under the care of their
       parents so that they may guide them on the path of the
       good, and has facilitated their task by giving children
       a frail and delicate organization that renders them
       accessible to all sorts of impressions. However, there are
       those who are more concerned with training the trees
       in their orchards and making them produce fine fruit
       than with training the character of their children. If their
       children fail due to their neglect, they will have to bear
       the punishment, and the sufferings of their children will
       come back to them in a future life because they did not
       do what was incumbent on them for their children’s
       advancement on the path of the good.”
583.   If a child goes astray, in spite of the care of the parents, are they
       still responsible?
       “No, but the more the child is disposed toward evil, the
       heavier their task is and the greater will be their merit if they
       manage to divert the child away from the path of evil.”
       – If a child becomes a good adult, despite the negligence or
       bad examples of the parents, do the parents receive any benefit
       from it?
       “God is just.”
584.   What could be the nature of the missions of conquerors
       whose only aim is to satisfy their ambition, and who, in
       order to reach their goal, do not recoil before any calamity
       they may cause?
       “Most of the time, they are nothing more than instruments
       used by God for fulfilling the divine designs. Such
       calamities are often the means for enabling a people to
       advance more rapidly.”


                                  341

                   Part Two – Chapter X


– If those who are the instruments of such temporary calamities
are unaware of the good that may result from them because
they inflicted them with a personal aim in mind, will they
nevertheless profit from the resultant good?
“All are rewarded according to their deeds, the good they
meant to do and the honesty of their intentions.”
  Incarnate spirits have occupations inherent to their corporeal
  existence. In the errant state or dematerialization, their occupations
  are in proportion to their degree of advancement. Some journey
  from world to world, learning and preparing for a new incarnation.
  Others, more advanced, occupy themselves with progress by
  directing events and suggesting favorable thoughts; they assist the
  geniuses who concur in the advancement of humankind. Others
  reincarnate on a mission of progress. Still others take under their
  care individuals, families, human agglomerations, cities and peoples,
  for whom they become guardian angels, protector spirits and fami­
  liar spirits. Finally, others preside over the phenomena of nature,
  of which they are the direct agents. Ordinary spirits meddle in our
  occupations and amusements. Impure or imperfect spirits wait in
  suffering and anguish for the moment in which it pleases God to
  grant them the means of advancing. If they practice evil, it is out of
  spite for not yet being able to enjoy the good.

               Human Beings • Metempsychosis



                  Minerals and Plants
585.   What do you think of the division of nature into three
       kingdoms or into two classes: organic beings and inorganic
       beings? Some regard the human species as a fourth kingdom.
       Which of these divisions is preferable?
       “They are all good. It depends on one’s point of view:
       from a material point of view, there are only inorganic and
       organic beings. From the moral point of view, however,
       there are obviously four degrees.”
        These four degrees in fact have well-marked characteristics,
        although their edges seem to blend into each other. Inert matter,
        which comprises the mineral kingdom, possesses no more than a
        mechanical energy; plants, although composed of inert matter,
        are endowed with vitality; animals, composed of inert matter
        and endowed with vitality, also have a kind of instinctive, limited
        intelligence, with an awareness of their existence and individuality;
        lastly, human beings possess everything that exists in plants and
        animals, and they dominate all the other classes through a special



                                  343

                             Part Two – Chapter XI


              and unlimited intelligence that provides them with the awareness
              of their future, the perception of extra-material things and the
              knowledge of God.

586.       Do plants have any awareness of their existence?
           “No, they do not think; they have only organic life.”
587.       Do plants feel sensations? Do they suffer when mutilated?
           “Plants receive the physical impressions that act upon
           matter, but they do not have perceptions; consequently,
           they do not feel the sensation of pain.”
588.       Is the force that attracts plants towards each other independent
           of their will?
           “Yes, because they do not think. It is a mechanical force of
           matter acting upon matter; they cannot oppose it.”
589.       Some plants – the mimosa and the dionea54, for example –
           show movements that indicate great sensitivity, and in
           some cases, a kind of will, like the latter, whose lobes seize
           the fly that lands on it in order to suck its juices, seeming to
           have set a trap to kill it. Are these plants endowed with the
           faculty of thought? Do they have a will and do they form an
           intermediary class between the plant and animal nature? Do
           they comprise a transition from the one to the other?
           “Everything in nature is in transition by the same fact that
           one thing does not resemble another, and that everything,
           nevertheless, is linked together. Plants do not think, and
           consequently have no will. The oyster, which opens itself,
           and all other zoophytes do not possess thought. They have
           no more than a blind and natural instinct.”
              The human organism furnishes us with examples of analogous
              movements that do not involve any participation of the will, such

        as the digestive and circulatory functions. The pylorus closes itself
        on contact with certain substances to refuse them passage. The
        same applies to the mimosa, whose movements do not imply any
        perception at all, much less a will.

590.   In plants, as in animals, isn’t there an instinct for self-
       preservation that leads them to seek what may be useful to
       them and to avoid what may harm them?
       “There is, if you wish, a kind of instinct. It depends on
       the extent you attribute to the word, but it is purely
       mechanical. When you see two bodies combine during a
       chemical reaction, it is because they harmonize with each
       other, that is, there is an affinity between them, but you do
       not call it instinct.”
591.   On more highly evolved worlds, are the plants, like the other
       beings, more perfect in nature?
       “Everything is more perfect, but the plants are always
       plants, as the animals are always animals, and as the human
       beings are always human beings.”


           Animals and Human Beings
592.   If we compare human beings with animals in relation
       to intelligence, it seems difficult to establish a line of
       demarcation, because certain animals on this earth have an
       obvious superiority over certain humans. Can such a line of
       demarcation be established in any precise manner?
       “Your philosophers are not in much agreement about
       this subject. Some would want for humans to be animals,
       and others for animals to be human. Both are wrong.
       Humans are beings apart, who sometimes sink very
       low, or who may sometimes ascend very high. In their


                                  345

                        Part Two – Chapter XI


       physical nature, humans are like the animals and less
       well-endowed than many of them. Nature has given the
       animals everything that humans are obligated to invent
       with their intelligence in order to provide for their own
       needs and self-preservation. Their body is destroyed like
       that of the animals – that is certain – but their spirit
       has a destiny that they alone can comprehend because
       they alone are completely free. Poor humans, who debase
       yourselves more than wild animals! Don’t you know how
       to distinguish yourselves from them? Recognize human
       beings through their ability to think about God.”
593.   Could we say that animals act only through instinct?
       “That again is a theory. It is quite true that instinct
       dominates most animals, but don’t you see some that act
       from a determined will? It is because they have limited
       intelligence.”
        One could not deny to certain animals the practice of complex
        actions that denote the will to act in a determined sense beyond
        instinct and according to circumstances. Therefore, there is in them
        a kind of intelligence, but in exercising it they are concentrating it
        more on the means of satisfying their physical needs and providing
        for their self-preservation. Among them there is no creation, no
        improvement. Whatever may be the skill that we admire in their
        labors, that which they did yesterday is the same as what they
        do today, neither better nor worse, according to constant and
        unvarying forms and proportions. Offspring separated from their
        species do not fail to build their nest in accordance with the same
        model without having been taught. If some animals are capable of a
        certain amount of learning, such intellectual development is always
        restricted within narrow limits and is due to human action on a
        flexible nature. They cannot make any progress by themselves, and
        when they do make progress, it is ephemeral and purely individual,
        because if abandoned to themselves, they quickly return to the
        limits traced out for them by nature.


                                  346

                         The Three Kingdoms


594.   Do animals have language?
       “If you mean a language formed of words and syllables,
       no, but if you mean a way of communicating amongst
       themselves, then yes. They say many more things than
       you might suppose, but their language is limited to their
       needs, as are their thoughts.”
       – There are animals that possess no voice. Aren’t they deprived
       of language?
       “They understand one another by other means. Don’t you
       human beings use more than speech to communicate with
       one another? And mutes, what about them? Since animals
       are endowed with a life of relationships, they have means
       of warning each other and of expressing the sensations they
       experience. Do you think that fish do not understand each
       other? Human beings do not have the exclusive privilege
       of language, but the language of animals is instinctive and
       limited exclusively to the circle of their own needs and
       thoughts, while that of humans is perfectible and lends
       itself to all the conceptions of their intelligence.”
         Actually, fish, like swallows, which migrate en masse obeying the
         lead, must have means of warning and understanding one another
         and grouping together. Perhaps they do so amongst themselves, or
         perhaps the water is a vehicle that transmits certain vibrations to
         them. Whatever the case may be, it is undeniable that they have the
         means available to understand one another, in the same way as all
         animals deprived of voice perform activities in common. In light of
         this, must one wonder at spirits’ being able to communicate with
         one another without recourse to articulated speech? (See no. 282)

595.   Do animals have free will?
       “They are not simple machines as you might suppose,
       but their freedom of action is limited to their needs and
       cannot be compared to human freedom. Since they are far


                                  347

                       Part Two – Chapter XI


       less evolved than human beings, they do not have the same
       duties. Their freedom is restricted to the actions of their
       material life.”
596.   Where do certain animals get their aptitude to imitate human
       language, and why is this aptitude found more among birds
       than among apes, for example, whose body structure is more
       analogous to the human structure?
       “The particular conformation of the vocal organs, aided
       by the instinct of imitation. Apes imitate gestures; certain
       birds imitate the voice.”
597.   Since animals have an intelligence that gives them a certain
       freedom of action, is there in them a principle independent of
       matter?
       “Yes, and it survives their body.”
       – Is this principle a soul similar to that of humans?
       “It is a soul, if you’d like; it depends on the meaning you
       attach to the word. It is much less evolved than that of
       humans, however. Between the souls of animals and
       humans there is as great a difference as there is between
       the human soul and God.”
598.   Does the animal’s soul retain its individuality and self-
       awareness after death?
       “Its individuality, yes, but not its self-awareness. Its
       intelligent life remains in a latent state.”
599.   Can an animal soul choose the species in which it prefers to
       incarnate?
       “No. It does not possess free will.”
600.   Since the animal’s soul survives its body, does it remain in an
       errant state like the human soul after death?


                                348

                         The Three Kingdoms


       “It remains in a type of errant state because it is not
       united to a body, but it is not an errant spirit. The
       errant spirit is a being who thinks and acts of its own
       free will. Animal spirits do not have the same faculty.
       Self-awareness is what comprises the principal attribute
       of the human spirit. After its death, an animal’s soul is
       classified by the spirits in charge of doing so and it is
       utilized almost immediately. It is not given time to enter
       into relations with other creatures.”
601.   Do animals follow a law of progress like humans?
       “Yes, and that is why on higher worlds, where humans
       are more advanced, the animals are also more advanced
       and possess more developed means of communication.
       However, they are always lower than humans and subject
       to them – they are their intelligent servants.”
         There is nothing extraordinary about this. Let us imagine that our
         more intelligent animals, such as the dog, the elephant and the
         horse were endowed with a physical conformation appropriate for
         manual labor. What mightn’t they do under human direction?

602.   Do animals progress by their will, like human beings, or by
       necessity?
       “By necessity. That is why there is no expiation for them.”
603.   On highly evolved worlds, do the animals know about God?
       “No. Human beings are gods to them, as spirits use to be
       gods to humans.”
604.   Since the animals – even the perfected ones of the higher
       worlds – are always beneath humans, wouldn’t this result in
       God having created intelligent beings perpetually condemned
       to inferiority? If so, wouldn’t this seem to be in disagreement
       with the unity of design and progress discernible in all of


                                  349

                        Part Two – Chapter XI


       God’s works?
       “Everything in nature is linked together by ties that you
       cannot yet perceive, and the most apparently discrepant
       things have points of contact that humans will never
       manage to comprehend in their present state. They may
       glimpse them through an effort of their intelligence, but it is
       only when that intelligence has reached its full development
       and frees itself from the prejudices of pride and ignorance
       that they will be able to see clearly into the works of God.
       Until then, their limited ideas will cause them to look at
       everything from a petty and limited point of view. Rest
       assured that God cannot be self-contradictory and that
       everything in nature is harmonized through general laws
       that never deviate from the sublime wisdom of the Creator.”
       – Then intelligence is a common property, a point of contact
       between the souls of animals and humans?
       “Yes, but animals only have the intelligence of material
       life; in humans, intelligence produces moral life.”
605.   If we considered all the points of contact between humans and
       animals, mightn’t we believe that humans possess two souls: an
       animal soul and a spiritual soul, and that if they did not have
       the latter, they would live only as animals? In other words,
       isn’t the animal a being similar to the human, minus the
       spiritual soul? If so, wouldn’t it follow that the good and evil
       instincts of humans would be the effect of the predominance
       of one or other of these two souls?
       “No, humans do not have two souls, but the body has its
       instincts, which result from the sensations of its organs.
       There is nothing in humans except a dual nature: the
       animal nature and the spiritual nature. Through their
       body and instincts, they participate in the nature and


                                350

                           The Three Kingdoms


       instincts of animals. Through their soul, they participate
       in the nature of spirits.”
       – Thus, besides getting rid of its own imperfections, must the
       spirit also struggle against the influence of matter?
       “Yes, the less evolved it is, the tighter are the bonds between
       the spirit and matter. Can’t you see that? No, humans do
       not have two souls; the soul is always one in each individual.
       The soul of animals and that of humans are so very different
       from each other that the soul of one cannot animate the
       body created for the other. But if humans do not possess an
       animal soul, whose passions would place it on the level of
       the animals, they nonetheless have an animal body, which
       often drags them down to that level – a body endowed
       with vitality, but unintelligent and possessed of the limited
       instincts required for its self-preservation.”
         When a spirit incarnates into a human body, it transmits to it the
         intellectual and moral principle that places it on a higher order than
         the animals. The two natures in humans give two distinct sources
         to their passions: some spring from the instincts of nature; others,
         from the impurities of the incarnate spirit, which sympathizes to a
         greater or lesser degree with the baseness of the animal appetites. In
         purifying itself, a spirit frees itself from the influence of matter little
         by little. Under such influence, it approaches the animals; freed
         from such influence, it rises toward its true destiny.

606.   Where do the animals get the intelligent principle that comprises
       the particular kind of soul with which they are endowed?
       “From the universal intelligent element.”
       – Then the intelligence of both humans and animals emanates
       from a single principle?
       “Of course, but in humans it goes through a development
       that elevates it above that of the animals.”

                        Part Two – Chapter XI


607.   It has been stated that the human soul at its origin resembles
       the state of human infancy in the corporeal life, that its
       intelligence is only beginning to unfold, and that it is preparing
       itself for life (see no. 190). Where does the soul accomplish this
       primary phase?
       “In a series of existences preceding the period you call
       humanity.”
       – Then it would seem that the soul had been the intelligent
       principle of the lower beings of creation; correct?
       “Haven’t we stated that everything in nature is linked
       together and tends toward unity? It is in those beings, whom
       you are far from knowing about entirely, that the intelligent
       principle is developed, is gradually individualized and is
       prepared for life, as we have stated. In a certain way, it is
       a preparatory work like that of germination, after which
       the intelligent principle undergoes a transformation and
       becomes a spirit. It is then that the period of humanity
       begins for it, and with it the consciousness of its future, the
       distinction between good and evil and the responsibility
       for its acts – the same way that childhood comes before
       adolescence, then youth and finally adulthood. There is
       nothing humiliating about this origin. Do the greatest
       geniuses feel humiliated at having been shapeless fetuses in
       the maternal womb? If anything ought to humiliate them,
       it is their low status before God and their powerlessness
       to probe the depths of the divine designs and the wisdom
       of the laws regulating the harmony of the universe. Strive
       to realize the greatness of God in the admirable harmony
       that establishes the solidarity of all things in nature. To
       believe that God could have made anything without a
       purpose, and have created intelligent beings without a
       future, would be to blaspheme God’s goodness, which


                                 352

                          The Three Kingdoms


       extends over all creatures.”
       – Does this period of humanity begin on our earth?
       “The earth is not the starting point of a human’s first
       incarnation. The period of humanness usually begins on
       worlds even less evolved. This, however, is not an absolute
       rule and it may happen that a spirit at its human beginning
       may be suited to live on the earth. Such a case is not frequent
       and would be an exception rather than a rule.”
608.   After death, does a human spirit have any awareness of the
       existences that preceded its period of humanness?
       “No, because it is only after that period that its life as a spirit
       began. It even has difficulty in remembering its first existences
       as a human, exactly as humans no longer remember the
       earliest days of their childhood, and still less the time they
       spent in the maternal womb. That is why spirits tell you that
       they do not know how they began.” (See no. 78)
609.   Having entered the period of humanness, does a spirit retain
       traces of what it had previously been; that is, of the state in which
       it found itself in the period that could be called non-human?
       “That depends on the distance separating the two periods
       and the progress it has accomplished. For a few generations
       it may preserve a more or less pronounced reflection of
       the primitive state, for nothing in nature occurs through
       an abrupt transition. There are always links connecting the
       end of the chain of beings or events. However, such traces
       disappear with the development of free will. The first steps
       of progress are accomplished slowly because they are not yet
       aided by the will; but they follow a more rapid progress as
       the spirit acquires a more perfect consciousness of itself.”
610.   Then are the spirits who have said that humans are beings


                                  353

                        Part Two – Chapter XI


       apart in the order of creation mistaken?
       “No, but the issue has not been fully developed and there
       are things that can only come in their time. Humans are
       in fact beings apart, for they have faculties that distinguish
       them from all others and they have another destiny.
       The human species is the one God has chosen for the
       incarnation of the beings who can know God.”


                     Metempsychosis
611.   Isn’t the common origin of living beings in the intelligent
       principle an affirmation of the doctrine of metempsychosis?
       “Two things may have the same origin, and yet not
       resemble each other at all later on. Who would recognize
       the tree, its leaves, its flowers and its fruit in the shapeless
       germ contained in the seed from which they came? From
       the moment when the intelligent principle reaches the
       necessary degree for becoming a spirit and for entering
       the period of humanness, it has no more relationship with
       its primitive state. It is no longer the soul of the animal
       like the tree is no longer a seed. In humans, there is only
       the animal-like body, the passions that arise from that
       body’s influence, and the instincts of self-preservation
       inherent in matter. Therefore, one cannot state that such
       and such a person is the incarnation of such and such
       an animal. Consequently, metempsychosis, as commonly
       understood, is incorrect.”
612.   Could a spirit that has animated a human body incarnate in
       an animal?
       “That would be a regression, and a spirit does not regress.
       The river does not flow back to is source.” (See no. 118)


                                354

                          The Three Kingdoms


613.   However erroneous may be the idea linked to metempsychosis,
       couldn’t it be a result of the intuitive sentiment of the different
       existences of an individual?
       “We recognize such an intuitive sentiment in this belief as
       in many others, but like most intuitive ideas, humans have
       perverted it.”
         Metempsychosis would be correct if one understood it to mean the
         progression of the soul from a lower to a higher state, accomplishing
         the developments that will transform its nature.
         However, it is erroneous in the meaning of direct transmigration from
         the animal to the human and vice versa, which would imply the idea
         of regression or fusion. And since such fusion is not possible between
         corporeal beings of two different species, we have an indication of
         their being of degrees that cannot assimilate each other, and the same
         must apply to the spirits that animate them. If the same spirit could
         animate them alternately, it would result in an identity of nature, and
         this would translate into the possibility of material reproduction. On
         the contrary, the reincarnation taught by the Spirits is founded upon
         the evolutionary march of nature and the progression of humans
         within their own species, which in no way diminishes their dignity.
         What degrades them is the bad use they make of the faculties God has
         given them for their advancement. Be what it may, the antiquity and
         universality of the doctrine of metempsychosis, and the number of
         eminent individuals who have professed it, proves that the principle
         of reincarnation has its roots in nature itself. These are arguments in
         its favor rather than against it, however.
         The point of departure of a spirit is one of those issues that are
         connected to the origin of things and that are among the secrets of
         God. It has not been given to humans to know them completely,
         and regarding them, they can only form mere suppositions,
         constructing more or less probable theoretic systems. The spirits
         themselves are far from knowing everything, and regarding what
         they do not know, they may also have their own opinions that are
         more sensible or less so.



                                    355

                              Part Two – Chapter XI


              It is thus that all do not think in the same way regarding the
              connections between humans and animals. According to some, a
              spirit only arrives at the human period after having been prepared
              and individualized in the different degrees of the lower order beings
              of creation. According to others, the human spirit would have always
              belonged to the human race without having passed through the
              animal experience. The first of these theories has the advantage of
              giving an aim to the future of animals, which would thus comprise
              the first links in the chain of thinking beings. The second is more
              in conformance with the dignity of the human being and may be
              summed up as follows:
              The different species of animals do not proceed intellectually from
              one another by way of evolution. Thus, the spirit of the oyster does
              not subsequently become that of the fish, the bird, the quadruped
              and, finally, the biped. Each species is an absolute type in itself,
              physically and mentally, and each of its individuals draws from
              the universal source the quantity of the intelligent principle that
              it needs, according to the perfection of its organs and the work
              it must perform in the phenomena of nature. It then returns to
              the general mass at death. Those worlds more advanced than ours
              (see no. 188) are also comprised of distinct species of animals that
              are appropriate to the needs of those worlds and to the degree of
              advancement of the humans they serve, but they do not proceed
              from those of the earth, spiritually speaking. It is not the same
              with human beings, however. From the physical point of view,
              human beings are obviously a link in the chain of living beings,
              but from the moral point of view there is a break in continuity
              between humans and animals. Only human beings possess a soul
              or spirit55, a divine spark that endows them with a moral sense
              and an intellectual reach that the animals do not possess; it is the
              principal being, pre-existent to and surviving the body, preserving
              their individuality. What is the origin of the spirit? Where is its
              starting point? Is it formed from the individualized intelligent
              principle? This is a mystery that would be useless to search out, and
              regarding which, as we have said, we can only construct theories.

What is constant and what stands out to reason and experience at
the same time, is the survival of the spirit, the preservation of its
individuality after death, its ability to evolve, its happy or unhappy
state in proportion to its advancement on the path of the good,
and all the moral truths that are the consequence of that principle.
As for the mysterious connections between humans and animals,
that, we repeat, is God’s secret, like many other matters whose
current understanding holds no importance for our advancement,
and on which it would be useless for us to dwell.

       Divine or Natural Law
  • The Characteristics of Natural Law • The Knowledge of
 Natural Law • Good and Evil • The Divisions of Natural Law



       The Characteristics of Natural Law
614.   What is meant by natural law?
       “Natural law is the law of God. It is the only law that is
       truly necessary for human beings to be happy. It shows
       them what they should or should not do, and they only
       suffer misfortune when they depart from it.”
615.   Is God’s law eternal?
       “It is as eternal and immutable as God is.”
616.   Can God prescribe to humankind in one age what would be
       prohibited in another?
       “God does not err. Humans are the ones who must modify
       their laws because they are imperfect, but God’s laws are perfect.
       The harmony regulating both the material and moral universe
       is founded upon laws that God has established forever.”
617.   What do the divine laws encompass? Do they apply to anything
       other than moral conduct?


                                 361

                          Part Three – Chapter I


       “All the laws of nature are divine because God is the author
       of all things. Scientists study the laws of matter, whereas
       moral individuals study and practice the laws of the soul.”
       – Do humans have the ability to master both the laws of
       nature and the laws of matter?
       “Yes, but a single existence is not enough to do so.”
         If we consider only the distance separating the primitive from the
         civilized individual, what, indeed, are a few years for acquiring
         everything that comprises a perfected being? The longest life
         possible is insufficient, and all the more so when it is cut short, as
         happens with a large number of people.
         Among the divine laws, some regulate the movement and workings
         of inert matter. These are the physical laws and studying them
         belongs to the domain of science.
         Others specifically concern humans and their relations with God
         and their fellow beings, encompassing the rules of the life of the
         body and the soul. These are the moral laws.

618.   Are the divine laws the same for all worlds?
       “Reason tells us they must be appropriate for the nature of
       each world and proportioned to the degree of advancement
       of the beings that inhabit them.”


 The Origin and Knowledge of Natural Law
619.   Has God provided all humans the means of knowing God’s law?
       “All may know about it, but not all understand it.
       Moral persons and those who desire to examine it are
       the ones who understand it best. Nevertheless, all will
       understand it someday because such understanding is
       necessary for progress.”

                         Divine or Natural Law


        The justice of multiple human incarnations springs from this
        principle because in each new existence humans’ intelligence
        becomes more developed and they better comprehend what is good
        and what is evil. If everything had to be accomplished in a single
        existence, what would be the fate of the many millions who die
        every day in the brutishness of the primitive state or in the darkness
        of ignorance simply because they were born into a situation that
        did not enable them to become enlightened? (See nos. 171 to 222)

620.   Before its union with the body, does the soul comprehend
       God’s law more clearly than after incarnating?
       “It comprehends God’s law according to the degree of
       its perfection, and it preserves an intuitive memory of it
       after uniting with the body. However, evil human instincts
       often cause it to forget it.”
621.   Where is God’s law written?
       “In the conscience.”
       – Since humans carry God’s law in their conscience, why does
       it have to be revealed to them?
       “They have forgotten and disregarded it; but God has
       willed for them to remember it.”
622.   Has God endowed certain individuals with the mission of
       revealing the divine law?
       “Yes, certainly. In every age individuals have received this
       mission. They are high order spirits who have incarnated
       with the purpose of enabling humankind to progress.”
623.   Haven’t those who were meant to instruct humankind in
       God’s law sometimes erred, and haven’t they often led others
       astray through erroneous principles?
       “People may have been led astray by those who were not
       actually inspired by God, and who, out of ambition,


                                  363

                          Part Three – Chapter I


       regarded themselves as having a mission that they did not in
       fact have. Nevertheless, they were geniuses and great truths
       could often be found even in the midst of their errors.”
624.   What are the characteristics of true prophets?
       “True prophets are moral individuals inspired by God,
       and whom we may recognize by their words and deeds.
       God does not employ a liar to teach the truth.”
625.   What is the perfect standard that God has offered to
       humankind as a guide and model?
       “Look at Jesus.”
         Jesus is the highest standard of moral perfection to which humankind
         may aspire on earth. God offers him as the most perfect model, and
         the doctrine he taught is the purest expression of God’s law because
         he was animated by the divine spirit and was the purest being that
         has ever walked the earth.
         If some of those who claimed to teach God’s law to humans have
         sometimes led them astray with erroneous principles, it is because they
         allowed themselves to be dominated by strong earthly sentiments,
         and because they confused the laws regulating the conditions of the
         life of the soul with those regulating the life of the body. Many of
         them presented as divine laws what were really only human laws,
         created to serve their own passions and to dominate others.

626.   Have the divine or natural laws been revealed to humankind
       only by Jesus? Before him, were they only known by intuition?
       “Haven’t we stated that they are written everywhere? From
       the remotest times, all who have meditated on wisdom
       have been able to understand and teach these laws.
       Though their teachings were incomplete, they prepared
       the ground to receive the seed. Since the divine laws are
       written in the book of nature, men and women are able
       to understand them as soon as they want to look into


                                    364

                       Divine or Natural Law


       them. That is why the precepts of the divine laws have
       been proclaimed by moral persons in all ages and also why
       we have encountered their elements – though incomplete
       or altered by ignorance and superstition – in the moral
       doctrines of all cultures that have left barbarism.”
627.   Since Jesus has already taught the true laws of God, of what
       value are the teachings given by the Spirits? Do they really
       have anything more to teach us?
       “Jesus’ teachings were frequently allegorical and in the
       form of parables because he spoke according to his time
       and place, but today the truth must be made intelligible
       for all. Thus, it is necessary to explain God’s laws more
       fully and elaborate on them because there are so few who
       understand them and still fewer who actually practice
       them. Our mission is to awaken eyes and ears in order
       to confound the proud and unmask the hypocrites who
       display virtue and religion outwardly in order to hide their
       inner turpitudes. The teaching of the Spirits must be clear
       and without error so that no one can feign ignorance and
       so that all may judge it and evaluate it with their own
       reason. We are in charge of preparing the Kingdom of
       God announced by Jesus, and that is why no one should
       be able to interpret the law of God according to his or her
       own passions or to distort the meaning of a law that is
       entirely love and charity.”
628.   Why hasn’t the truth always been within everyone’s reach?
       “Each thing must come in its own time. Truth is like light:
       we must accustom ourselves to it little by little; otherwise,
       it dazzles us.
       “There has never been a time in which God allowed
       humankind to receive communications as complete and


                               365

                      Part Three – Chapter I


       instructive as the ones being given today. As you know,
       in ancient times there were only a few individuals who
       were in possession of what they regarded as a sacred
       science, and which they kept as a mystery from other
       individuals, whom they considered as being profane.
       You must understand from what you know of the laws
       governing spirit phenomena that those ancients received
       only fragmentary truths amongst an ambiguous, often
       highly symbolic collection. Nevertheless, enlightened
       individuals nowadays should not discount any ancient
       philosophical system, tradition or religion, because
       they all contain the seeds of great truths. Although they
       seem to contradict one another and are scattered among
       unfounded embellishments, today they are much easier
       to comprehend, thanks to the key that Spiritism has
       provided. It is a key to an infinite number of things that
       until now seemed unreasonable, but whose reality has
       recently been irrefutably demonstrated. Therefore, do not
       fail to make those materials subjects of your study. They
       are very rich in teachings and may contribute a great deal
       to your education.”


                     Good and Evil
629.   What definition may be given to morality?
       “Morality is the rule of good conduct; in other words, it
       is the ability to distinguish between good and evil. It is
       founded on the observance of God’s law. Humans behave
       correctly when they do everything for the good of all, for
       then they obey God’s law.”
630.   How can we distinguish between good and evil?



                               366

                        Divine or Natural Law


       “Good is everything that is in harmony with God’s law,
       whereas evil is everything that deviates from it. Thus,
       doing what is good conforms to God’s law, while doing
       evil infringes on it.”
631.   Do humans have the means within them to distinguish
       between good and evil?
       “Yes, when they believe in God and desire to know
       God, who has given them intelligence to discern one
       from the other.”
632.   Since humans are prone to error, couldn’t they be mistaken
       in discerning good from evil and believe that they are doing
       what is good, when in reality they are doing what is evil?
       “Jesus said, ‘Do unto others what you would want them
       do unto you’; that sums up everything. Obey it and you
       will never go wrong.”
633.   The rule of good and evil, which may be called the rule of
       “reciprocity” or “solidarity”, does not apply to individuals’ own
       conduct regarding themselves. Can they find a rule and a safe
       guide for such conduct in natural law?
       “When you eat too much, it harms you. Well then, that
       is God letting you know how much you really need, and
       when you exceed it, you are punished. The same applies
       to everything else. Natural law outlines for all humans the
       limit of their needs, and when they exceed that limit they
       are punished by suffering. If they would always listen to
       that voice that says ‘enough’, they would avoid most of the
       ills they accuse nature of.”
634.   Why may evil be found in the very nature of things? I am
       speaking of moral evil. Couldn’t God have created humankind
       under better moral conditions?


                                 367

                          Part Three – Chapter I


       “We have already told you: spirits are created simple and
       ignorant (see no. 115). God leaves men and women to
       choose their own path, and it is worse for them if they
       take the evil one – their pilgrimage will be all the longer. If
       there were no mountains, humans would not understand
       that they can ascend and descend; if there were no rocks,
       they would not understand that there are hard objects.
       The spirit must acquire experience, and to do so it must
       know good and evil. That is why there is a union of spirit
       and body.” (See no. 119)
635.   The different social positions create needs that are not the
       same for everyone. Is natural law, therefore, not a uniform
       rule for everyone?
       “Such different positions exist in nature itself and are
       in accord with the law of progress, but this fact does
       not invalidate the unity of natural law, which applies to
       everything.”
         The conditions of a person’s existence change according to time and
         place; hence, the different needs and social positions corresponding
         to such needs. Since this diversity is in the very order of things, it
         conforms to God’s law, which nonetheless continues to be one in
         principle. It thus falls to reason to distinguish between real needs
         and fictitious or conventional needs.

636.   Are good and evil absolute for everybody?
       “God’s law is the same for everybody, but evil especially
       depends on the willingness one has for doing it. Good
       is always good and evil is always evil, whatever a person’s
       position may be. The difference is in the degree of
       responsibility.”
637.   Are cannibals who yield to their instinct guilty when they eat
       human flesh?


                                   368

                         Divine or Natural Law


       “I have said that evil depends on the will. Well then, persons
       are guiltier the more they know what they should do.”
         Circumstances give good and evil a relative seriousness. People
         frequently commit wrongs that are nonetheless reprehensible even
         if they result from the social position in which society has placed
         them; however, their responsibility depends on the means at their
         disposal for comprehending good and evil. Thus, the enlightened
         person who commits a simple injustice is guiltier in God’s sight
         than the primitive who obeys his or her natural instincts.

638.   It seems that evil sometimes results from necessity. Such is,
       for example, the necessity in certain cases for destruction,
       even that of our fellow beings. In such cases, has there been a
       transgression of God’s law?
       “Evil is no less evil by being necessary, but this necessity
       disappears as the soul purifies itself in passing from one
       existence to another. Then people become guiltier when they
       commit evil because they have a better understanding of it.”
639.   The evil we commit frequently results from the position in which
       others have placed us. In such a case, who is more culpable?
       “The responsibility for evil falls upon the one who has
       caused it. Thus, those who are led into evil by the position
       in which others have placed them are less culpable than
       those who have made them commit it. All will suffer the
       penalty not only for the evil they have done, but for the
       evil they have caused.”
640.   Are those who do not do evil themselves, but who take advantage
       of the evil committed by others culpable to the same degree?
       “It is as if they themselves had committed it; upon taking
       advantage of it, they participate in it. Perhaps they would
       have recoiled before the deed itself, but once it was done
       and they then took advantage of it, it was because they


                                  369

                         Part Three – Chapter I


       approved of it and would have committed it themselves if
       they could have or if they had been more daring.”
641.   Is the desire for evil as reprehensible as evil itself?
       “That depends. There is virtue in willingly resisting the
       desire for evil if one desires to commit it, especially when
       there is a possibility of satisfying the desire. However, if it
       is only because the opportunity did not present itself, the
       person is culpable.”
642.   In order to be pleasing to God and to ensure our future
       situation, is it enough simply not to do what is evil?
       “No. All must do good to the best of their abilities, for all
       will answer for all the evil that has resulted from the good
       they left undone.”
643.   Are there persons who have no possibility of doing good because
       of their position?
       “There are none who cannot do good; only selfish persons
       never find an opportunity for doing so. It is enough to
       come in contact with others in order to do good, and
       everyday life offers such a possibility to whomever is not
       blinded by selfishness. Doing good does not only mean
       being charitable, but also being as useful as possible
       whenever your help is needed.”
644.   Aren’t the surroundings in which certain people live the main
       reason for many to involve themselves in vice and crime?
       “Yes, but even then it is the result of a trial chosen by their
       spirit in the state of freedom. It wanted to expose itself to
       temptation in order to have the merit of resisting it.”
645.   When individuals are immersed in an atmosphere of vice,
       doesn’t evil become an almost irresistible draw?



                                  370

                       Divine or Natural Law


       “Draw, yes; irresistible, no, because in the midst of such an
       atmosphere of vice you can nonetheless find great virtue.
       There are spirits who have the strength to resist, and who
       have, at the same time, the mission of exerting a good
       influence on their fellow beings.”
646.   Does the merit of the good that one does depend on certain
       conditions; that is, are there different degrees of merit in
       doing good?
       “The merit lies in its difficulty. There is no merit in doing
       good if there is no self-denial and if it costs nothing. God
       takes more notice of poor individuals who share their
       only piece of bread than of the rich who give only what is
       superfluous to them. Jesus told you this in the parable of
       the widow’s mite.”


          The Divisions of Natural Law
647.   Is the entire law of God contained in Jesus’ maxim of loving
       one’s neighbor?
       “This maxim certainly reaffirms all humankind’s duties
       toward each other, but it is necessary to show them its
       application, because otherwise, they will neglect such
       duties, as they in fact do nowadays. Moreover, natural law
       covers all life’s circumstances, and this particular maxim
       refers to only one of its aspects. People need precise rules.
       General and overly vague precepts leave too many doors
       open to interpretation.”
648.   What do you think of the division of natural law into ten
       parts, covering the laws of worship, labor, reproduction,
       preservation, destruction, society, progress, equality, liberty
       and lastly, the law of justice, love and charity?


                                371

                 Part Three – Chapter I


“The division of God’s law into ten parts comes from
Moses and covers all the circumstances of life, which is the
essential point. You may follow that division, although like
other classification systems, it does not contain anything
absolute. Such systems always depend on the point of
view from which a subject is considered. The last law is
the most important since through it humans can advance
the farthest in the spiritual life – it sums up all the others.”

   • The Purpose of Worship • Outward Worship Forms •

              The Purpose of Worship
649.   What does worship entail?
       “Worship is the lifting up of the thought toward God.
       Through worship, the soul draws nearer to its Creator.”
650.   Is worship the result of an innate sentiment or the product of
       education?
       “An innate sentiment, like that of the Divinity. The
       awareness of their weakness leads humans to bow before
       the One who can protect them.”
651.   Have there ever been peoples devoid of all sentiment of
       worship?
       “No, because there have never been atheistic peoples.
       All have understood that there is a Supreme Being
       above them.”
652.   Does worship have its source in natural law?



                                373

                       Part Three – Chapter II


       “It is part of natural law because it is the result of an innate
       sentiment in humankind. That is why we find it among all
       peoples, albeit expressed in different forms.”


              Outward Worship Forms
653.   Does worship require outward expression?
       “True worship comes from the heart. In all your actions,
       always remember that the Lord is watching you.”
       – Are outward worship forms useful nonetheless?
       “Yes, if they are not a vain pretense. They are always
       useful for setting a good example, but those who practice
       such forms of worship only out of affectation and vanity,
       belying their appearance of piety, set a bad example
       rather than a good one, and they do more harm than
       they can imagine.”
654.   Does God have any preference for those who worship in this or
       that manner?
       “God prefers those who sincerely worship from the bottom
       of their heart, doing good and avoiding evil, to those who
       think they honor God through ceremonies that do not
       render them any better than their neighbor.
       “All are brothers and sisters, children of the same God,
       and God calls all those who follow the divinely established
       laws, whatever may be the form in which they express
       themselves.
       “Those who only put on an appearance of piety are
       hypocrites; those for whom worship is only a pretense that
       is contradicted by their actual conduct set a bad example.


                                374

                         The Law of Worship


       “Those who profess to worship Christ, but who are proud,
       envious and jealous, who are hard and unforgiving toward
       others, or who are ambitious for worldly things, I declare
       to you that their religion is on their lips only and not in
       their heart. God, who sees everything, will say: Those who
       know the truth are a hundred times guiltier of the evil they
       do than the unknowing nomad in the desert, and they will
       be treated accordingly on judgment day. If a blind person
       passing by you accidentally knocks you down you forget
       about it, but if it is a person whose sight is perfect, you
       rightly take offense.
       “So do not ask if there is one particular form of worship that is
       the most acceptable, since that would be like asking whether
       it is more pleasing to God to be worshipped in one language
       rather than in another. I will say to you once more: hymns do
       not reach God except through the door of the heart.”
655.   Is it wrong to practice a religion that is not believed in from
       the bottom of the heart if it is done out of human respect and
       in order not to offend those who think differently?
       “As in so many other things, the intent is the rule. Those
       whose sole aim is to show respect for the beliefs of others
       do no wrong; in fact, they do better than those who
       would ridicule such beliefs, since that would show a lack
       of charity. However, those who practice a religion out of
       ulterior motives or ambition are contemptible in the sight
       of God and humankind. God could not be pleased with
       those who only put on a show of humility in order to gain
       the approval of others.”
656.   Is group worship preferable to individual worship?
       “Those who assemble for communion of thought and
       sentiment have more power to attract good spirits, and the


                                 375

                       Part Three – Chapter II


       same applies when they gather to worship God. But do not
       think that individual worship is therefore less effective, for
       each individual can worship God with divine thoughts.”


              The Contemplative Life
657.   Do those who dedicate themselves to the contemplative life,
       doing no evil and thinking only of God, have any merit in the
       divine sight?
       “No. Even though they do nothing evil, neither do they
       do any good. Moreover, not doing good is in itself evil.
       God wants men and women to think about God, but
       does not want them to do only that, for God has given
       them duties to fulfill. Those who spend all their time in
       meditation and contemplation do nothing meritorious
       before God since their life is entirely personal and of no
       use to humankind. God will ask them to account for the
       good they did not do.” (See no. 640)


                             Prayer
658.   Is prayer pleasing to God?
       “A prayer is always pleasing to God when spoken from
       the heart, for intent is everything to God. A prayer from
       the heart is preferable to one you read no matter how
       beautiful it may be if you read more with the lips than
       with the thought. Prayer is pleasing to God when it is
       offered with faith, fervor and sincerity. Do not believe,
       however, that God is touched by the prayer of vain, proud
       or selfish people, unless their prayer represents an act of
       sincere repentance and true humility.”

                                376

                        The Law of Worship


659.   What is the general character of prayer?
       “Prayer is an act of worship. Praying to God is thinking
       of God, drawing nearer to God, putting one’s self in
       communication with God. Through prayer we may do
       three things: praise, ask and thank.”
660.   Does prayer make people better?
       “Yes, because those who pray fervently and confidently
       strengthen themselves against the temptations of evil, and
       God sends them good spirits to assist them. Such help is
       never refused when sincerely asked for.”
       – Why is it that certain persons who pray a great deal are
       nevertheless of a very evil, jealous, envious, cantankerous
       character, lacking in benevolence and forbearance – even cruel?
       “What is essential is not to pray a great deal, but to
       pray rightly. Such persons think that all the merit lies
       in the length of the prayer, and they shut their eyes to
       their own defects. For them, prayer is an occupation,
       a use of time, but it is not self-examination. It is not
       the remedy per se that is ineffectual, but the manner
       in which it is applied.”
661.   May one effectively ask God to forgive one’s sins?
       “God knows how to discern between good and evil; prayer
       does not hide sins. Those who ask God to forgive their
       sins do not receive forgiveness unless they change their
       conduct. Good deeds are the best prayers, for deeds are
       worth more than words.”
662.   May one pray effectively for others?
       “The spirit of the one who prays acts out of a will to
       do good. Through prayer, it attracts good spirits who
       cooperate in the good it desires to do.”


                                377

                         Part Three – Chapter II


         Through our thought and will, we possess an inner power of action
         that extends far beyond the limits of our corporeal sphere. A prayer
         for others is an act of that will. If it is ardent and sincere, it can
         call good spirits to the aid of those for whom we ask it so that the
         good spirits may suggest good thoughts to them and give them the
         needed strength for body and soul. But even then, the prayer from
         the heart is everything; that from the lips is nothing.

663.   Can the prayers we offer for ourselves modify the nature of our
       trials and change their course?
       “Your trials are in God’s hands and there are those that
       must be endured to the very end; however, God always
       takes resignation into account. Prayer attracts good spirits
       who give you strength to courageously endure your trials;
       thus, they seem less difficult to you. As we have already
       stated, prayer is never useless when offered rightly, because
       it provides strength, which in itself is a good result. Heaven
       helps those who help themselves – you know this. Besides,
       God could not change the workings of nature to suit the
       taste of each and every individual, since what may be a great
       evil from your narrow point of view and for your ephemeral
       life is often a great good within the general order of the
       universe. Furthermore, how many misfortunes are authored
       by people themselves through their own improvidence or
       wrongdoing? They are punished for their specific sins.
       Nevertheless, your just requests are heard more often than
       you might suppose. You think that God has not heard your
       prayer because there has been no miracle on your behalf,
       while you have in fact received divine assistance through
       means so natural that it seems to have happened by chance
       or by necessity. Most often, God suggests the thought
       needed for you to get yourselves out of your predicament.”
664.   Is it any use praying for the dead and for suffering spirits,
       and if so, how can our prayers provide them consolation and


                                   378

                        The Law of Worship


       shorten their sufferings? Do our prayers have the power to
       appease the justice of God?
       “Prayer has no effect in changing God’s designs, but
       the soul for whom you pray experiences relief because
       it witnesses the interest you show in it, and because an
       unhappy soul is always consoled when it encounters other
       charitable souls who share in its suffering. Moreover,
       through prayer you may incite it to repentance and the
       desire to do what is needed to become happy. It is in this
       sense that you can shorten its affliction if on its part it
       contributes with its own goodwill. Aroused by prayer,
       such a desire to improve attracts to the suffering spirit
       other spirits, who come to enlighten, console and give it
       hope. Jesus prayed for the straying sheep. In doing so, he
       showed you that you are culpable if you do not pray for
       those who are the most in need.”
665.   What is to be thought of the opinion that rejects praying for
       the dead because it is not prescribed in the Gospels?
       “Christ said to all humankind, ‘Love one another.’ This
       recommendation implies using all possible means to
       demonstrate love toward others, but without going into
       any details regarding the way to reach this goal. If it is
       true that nothing can turn God aside from applying divine
       justice to every one of a spirit’s actions, it is no less true
       that the prayer you direct to God on behalf of those who
       inspire your love is for them a testimony of remembrance
       that consoles them and contributes toward relieving their
       sufferings. They can be helped when – and only when –
       they show the slightest repentance, but it will nevertheless
       cause them never to forget that a sympathetic soul has
       been concerned about them. It will instill in them the
       sweet belief that your intercession has been useful. This


                                379

                                Part Three – Chapter II


          necessarily results on their part in a sentiment of love for
          the one who has shown this proof of friendship and piety.
          Consequently, the love recommended to humankind by
          Christ has increased between them, and both have obeyed
          the law of love and union of all beings, the divine law that
          must lead to unity – the spirit’s objective and purpose.”56
666.      May we pray to spirits?
          “You may pray to good spirits since they are the
          messengers of God and the executors of the divine designs.
          Their power, however, is in proportion to their degree
          of evolution and always derives from the Creator of all
          things, without whose permission nothing is done. For
          this reason, the prayers that we address to them are only
          effective if pleasing to God.”


                                   Polytheism
667.      If it is erroneous, why is polytheism one of the most ancient
          and widespread beliefs?
          “The idea of a single God could only appear among humans
          as the result of the development of their minds. Incapable
          in their ignorance of conceiving of an immaterial being
          without a determined form and who acted upon matter, they
          endowed God with the attributes of the corporeal nature,
          that is, a form and a figure. From then on, everything that
          seemed to surpass the proportions of ordinary intelligence
          became a deity to them. Whatever they could not
          understand had to be the work of a supernatural power, and
          it was no more than a small step from that to believing in as

  1856. The preceding reply, no. 664, was given by the Spirit of St. Louis – Auth.

       many distinct powers as there were effects. Nonetheless, in
       all ages there have been enlightened individuals who have
       understood the impossibility of such a multitude of powers
       for governing the world without some higher direction over
       them all, and who, consequently, lifted up their thought to
       a single God.”
668.   Since spirit phenomena have been produced throughout time
       and have been known about since the world began, couldn’t
       they have contributed to the belief in the plurality of gods?
       “Of course, because humans labeled as God everything
       that was supra-human; thus, the spirits were gods to them.
       Also, that is why that, whenever individuals distinguished
       themselves among others by their actions, their genius or a
       secret power that the common folk could not comprehend,
       they were made into a god and worshipped after death.”
       (See no. 603)
        Among the ancients, the word god had a wide range of meanings. It
        was not, as nowadays, a personification of the Author of Nature, but
        was a generic label attached to all beings that did not belong to the
        human condition. Moreover, since spirit manifestations revealed to
        the ancients the existence of incorporeal beings acting as powers of
        nature, they called them gods, just as we call them spirits. It is a mere
        question of words, but with the difference that in their ignorance –
        intentionally maintained by those who had an interest in doing so –
        they built lucrative temples and altars, whereas for us, spirits are merely
        creatures similar to us at differing degrees of perfection, and who have
        shed their earthly envelope. If we carefully study the various attributes
        of the pagan deities, we can easily recognize all those who characterize
        the spirits at every degree of the spirit scale, their physical state on
        more highly evolved worlds, all the properties of their perispirit and
        the role they perform concerning earthly things.
        When Christianity came to enlighten the world with its divine
        light, it could not destroy a thing that was in nature itself;



                                    381

                        Part Three – Chapter II


        instead, it redirected worship towards the One to whom it
        really belonged. As for the spirits, their remembrance has been
        perpetuated under various names and according to various cultures.
        Their manifestations have never ceased and have been diversely
        interpreted and frequently exploited under the influence of mystery.
        While religion has regarded spirit manifestations as miraculous
        phenomena, disbelievers have taken them as charlatanism. Now,
        however, thanks to a more serious study that has been conducted in
        the full light of day, Spiritism has been freed from the superstitious
        ideas that had obscured it down through time and has revealed to us
        one of the greatest and most sublime principles of nature.



                             Sacrifice
669.   The practice of human sacrifice dates back to remotest
       antiquity. Why was humankind led to believe that such a
       thing could be pleasing to God?
       “First, because they did not understand God as being
       the source of the good. Amongst primitive peoples
       matter predominated over spirit. They yielded to their
       animal instincts and that is why they were generally so
       cruel – their moral sense had not yet developed. Second,
       primitive humans naturally believed that a living creature
       had much more value in God’s sight than an inert object.
       This is what led them at first to immolate animals and
       humans later, because, according to their erroneous belief,
       they thought the value of a sacrifice was in proportion to
       the importance of the victim. Usually, whenever you buy
       a gift for someone, you always select one with as great a
       value as the friendship and consideration you want to
       show the person. The same applied to ignorant humans
       with respect to God.”
       – Then the sacrificing of animals preceded that of human

                                  382

                         The Law of Worship


       beings?
       “There can be no doubt about it.”
       – According to that explanation, didn’t human sacrifices
       originate from a sentiment of cruelty?
       “No, but from a mistaken concept of what was pleasing to
       God – look at Abraham. In time, humans began to commit
       the abuse of immolating their national enemies and even
       their personal enemies. However, God has never demanded
       sacrifices – animal or human. God could never be honored
       by the useless destruction of God’s own creatures.”
670.   Could human sacrifices ever have been pleasing to God if
       performed with pious intentions?
       “No, never, but God does judge the intention. Since they
       were ignorant, those ancients may have believed they were
       performing a praiseworthy deed in immolating one of their
       fellow beings. In that case, God would have heeded the
       thought but not the deed. As they evolved, human beings
       had to recognize their error and reject such sacrifices, which
       could no longer be acceptable to enlightened spirits; I say
       enlightened because, back then, spirits were shrouded by
       the veil of matter. By their free will, however, they were
       able to perceive their origin and their final purpose, and
       many already intuitively understood the evil they were
       committing, although in order to continue gratifying their
       passions they did not cease practicing it.”
671.   What should we think of so-called holy wars? Wouldn’t the
       sentiment that leads fanatical peoples to think they are pleasing
       God by exterminating the greatest possible number of those who
       do not share their beliefs have the same origin as the sentiment
       that formerly led them to sacrifice their fellow beings?
       “Such peoples are driven by evil spirits. By waging war on

                                 383

                       Part Three – Chapter II


       their fellow beings, they act against the will of God, who
       requires that people love their neighbors as themselves.
       All religions, or rather, all peoples, worship the same
       God whether by this or that name. Why wage a war of
       extermination because a religion is different, or has not
       yet attained the religious progress typical of enlightened
       cultures? Peoples may be excused for not believing in the
       word of the one who was animated by the Spirit of God
       and sent by God, especially those who have neither seen
       God nor witnessed the divine acts. But how could you
       possibly expect them to believe in that word of peace when
       you seek them out while bearing a sword? They must be
       educated and we must seek to enable them to understand
       his doctrine – by persuasion and kindness rather than
       by force and blood. Most of you do not believe in our
       communications with certain mortals, so how could you
       expect strangers to believe in your words when your acts
       belie the doctrine you profess?”
672.   Did the offering of the fruits of the earth have more merit in
       God’s sight than the sacrificing of animals?
       “I have already answered that by saying that God judges the
       intention; the deed itself holds little importance. Offering
       the fruits of the earth rather than the blood of victims would
       obviously be more agreeable to God. As we have told you
       and continue to repeat, a prayer said from the bottom of the
       heart is a hundred times more pleasing to God than all the
       physical offerings you could make. I repeat: the intention
       here is everything; the deed, nothing.”
673.   Mightn’t there have been a way of rendering those offerings
       more pleasing to God by consecrating them to the relief of those
       who lacked the necessities of life? And in that case, mightn’t
       the sacrificing of animals, performed towards such a useful


                                384

                 The Law of Worship


end, have been more meritorious than an abusive sacrifice
that served no useful end, or when it profited only those who
did not need anything? Wouldn’t there be something truly
pious in consecrating to the poor the firstfruits of the earth
that God has granted us?
“God always blesses those who practice the good; helping
the poor and afflicted is the best means of honoring God. I
do not mean to say that God disapproves of the ceremonies
you use for prayer; however, there is a great deal of money
spent on such ceremonies that could be employed more
usefully. God loves simplicity in all things. The person
who attaches importance to external acts and not those
of the heart is a narrow-minded spirit. Judge for yourself
as to whether or not God should be more concerned with
form than with depth.”

                                M

            The Law of Labor
       • The Necessity of Labor • The Limit of Labor. Rest



                The Necessity of Labor
674.    Is the necessity of labor a law of nature?
        “Labor is a law of nature, and as such is a necessity per
        se. Because civilization both increases peoples’ needs and
        their enjoyments, it obliges them to work more.”
675.    Should we understand labor to entail only material
        occupations?
        “No; the spirit labors as much as the body. Every useful
        occupation is labor.”
676.    Why has labor been imposed on humankind?
        “It is a consequence of their corporeal nature. It is a means
        of expiation and at the same time a means of perfecting
        their intelligence. Without labor, humans would remain in
        intellectual infancy. Thus, they must owe their food, safety and
        well-being to their own labor and activity. God has granted
        more intelligence to certain persons in order to compensate for
        their physical weakness, but labor is involved nonetheless.”


                                  387

                       Part Three – Chapter III


677.   Why does nature itself provide for all the needs of the animals?
       “Everything in nature labors. Animals labor as you do,
       but their work, like their intelligence, is limited to their
       self-­
            preservation. That is why labor does not lead to
       progress among them, while among human beings it has
       a double objective: the preservation of the body and the
       development of thought. The latter is also a necessity
       and raises them above themselves. When I say that the
       labor of animals is limited to self-preservation, I mean the
       objective toward which their labor is aimed. But while
       devoted entirely to providing for their physical needs, they
       are also unknowingly agents collaborating in the designs
       of the Creator. Their labor plays no less of a part in the
       final objective of nature, although you often do not see its
       immediate result.”
678.   On more highly evolved worlds, are humans subjected to the
       same necessity of labor?
       “The nature of the labor is relative to that of the needs;
       the fewer the material needs, the less material the labor.
       Yet, you must not assume that humans on such worlds
       remain inactive and useless; idleness would be a torture
       instead of a benefit.”
679.   Are those who possess plenty of assets to ensure their welfare
       exempted from the law of labor?
       “From physical labor, perhaps, but not from the obligation
       to render themselves useful according to their means and
       to perfect their own and others’ intelligence; this too is
       labor. If those to whom God has granted enough assets
       to ensure their welfare are not obligated to eat their bread
       from the sweat of their brow, their obligation to be useful
       to their fellow creatures is all the greater. It is a portion


                                 388

                         The Law of Labor


       they have received in advance, allowing them more free
       time to do good.”
680.   Aren’t there those who are incapable of working at anything at
       all and whose existence serves no purpose?
       “God is just and only condemns those who intentionally live
       a life that serves no purpose because they live by depending on
       other peoples’ work. God desires for all to make themselves
       useful according to their own faculties.” (See no. 643)
681.   Does the law of nature impose upon children the obligation to
       work for their parents?
       “Certainly, just as parents must work for their children.
       That is why God has made filial love and parental love
       natural sentiments so that by such mutual love the
       members of the same family may be led to help each other.
       This is frequently not recognized in your present society.”
       (See no. 205)


              The Limit of Labor. Rest
682.   Since rest is needed after labor, isn’t rest therefore a law of
       nature?
       “Absolutely. Rest serves to restore the strength of the
       body; it is also needed to give a little more freedom to the
       intelligence, which must raise itself above matter.”
683.   What is the limit of labor?
       “The limit of one’s strength; however, in this regard, God
       leaves people free to decide what their limit is.”
684.   What is to be thought of those who abuse their authority by
       imposing too much work on their subordinates?


                                389

                        Part Three – Chapter III


       “It is one of the worst things they could do. All who
       have the power of command are responsible for any
       excessive work they impose on their subordinates
       since if they do so, they transgress the law of God.”
       (See no. 273)
685.   Do humans have the right to retire in old age?
       “Yes. None are required to labor beyond their ability to
       do so.”
       – But what resources do aging people have available if they
       must earn a living but cannot?
       “The strong should work for the weak. In the absence of a
       family, society should replace it. That is the law of charity.”
         It is not enough to tell people they must work; it is also necessary
         for those who make their living from their labor to actually be
         able to find employment, but this does not always happen.
         Whenever the lack of available work is widespread, it assumes
         the proportions of a calamity, much like a famine. Economic
         science seeks a remedy in the balance between production and
         consumption, but this balance – supposing that it is possible –
         will always experience cycles, and during such phases workers
         must still make a living. There is an element that has not been
         sufficiently pondered, but without which economic science is
         nothing more than theory: education; not intellectual education
         but moral education; not moral education through books, but
         moral education that consists in the art of forming character;
         moral education that creates habits because education is the sum
         of acquired habits. When one considers the mass of individuals
         who are daily thrown into the torrent of the population, without
         principles, without restraints and handed over to their own
         instincts, can we wonder at the disastrous consequences? When
         the art of education is recognized, understood and practiced,
         all individuals the world over will follow the habits of order and
         forethought for themselves and their dependents. They will respect



                                   390

                  The Law of Labor


whatever is respectable, and will have habits that will enable them
to less painfully endure unavoidable adverse days. Disorder and
lack of forethought are two sores that only a sound education can
heal. That is the starting point, the real element of well-being,
the guarantee of security for all.

  The Law of Reproduction
• The Global Population • The Succession and Perfecting of the Races
  • Obstacles to Reproduction • Marriage and Celibacy • Polygamy


                The Global Population
686.   Is the reproduction of living beings a law of nature?
       “Obviously; without reproduction the corporeal world
       would die out.”
687.   If the population continues to follow the constant progression
       that we now see, will a time come in which it is too excessive
       for the earth?
       “No. God has foreseen this and always keeps everything
       in balance; God does nothing useless. Since they only see
       one angle of the picture of nature, humans are unable to
       perceive the harmony of the whole.”


 The Succession and Perfecting of the Races
688.   At this moment, there are certain human races that are
       obviously diminishing. Will a time come when they will have
       completely disappeared from the earth?


                                393

                       Part Three – Chapter IV


       “Yes, but others will have taken their place, as others will
       someday take yours.”
689.   Are the human beings of today a new creation or are they the
       perfected descendants of primitive beings?
       “They are the same spirits. They have returned to perfect
       themselves in new bodies, but they are still far from
       perfection. Thus, the present human race, which, through
       its growth, tends to invade the whole earth and to replace
       the races that are dying out, will also go through its own
       period of decrease and extinction. Other more perfected
       races will replace it. These will have descended from the
       present ones, just as the civilized human beings of the
       present day have descended from the brutes and primitives
       of early eras.”
690.   From a purely physical point of view, are the bodies of the
       present race a special creation, or have they evolved from more
       primitive bodies by way of reproduction?
       “The origin of the human race is lost in the night of time,
       but since all belong to one great human family, whatever
       the primitive roots of each race were, they have since been
       able to mix with one another and produce new types.”
691.   From a physical standpoint, what is the distinctive and
       dominant characteristic of primitive races?
       “The development of brute strength at the expense of
       intellectual prowess. The opposite is occurring nowadays:
       humans act more through their intelligence than through
       physical strength; and yet, they accomplish a hundred
       times more because they have placed the forces of nature
       at their service, which the animals cannot do.”
692.   Is the improvement of animal and vegetable species through


                                394

                      The Law of Reproduction


       science contrary to natural law? Wouldn’t it be more in
       conformance with that law to allow things to follow their
       normal course?
       “Everything must be done to arrive at perfection. Humans
       themselves are an instrument that God uses as a means for
       accomplishing the divine ends. Since perfection is the goal
       toward which nature tends, to favor such perfection is to
       correspond to those ends.”
       – But in their efforts to improve various species, humans
       are generally motivated by a personal sentiment that has no
       other goal than to increase their own enjoyments. Doesn’t this
       diminish their merit?
       “What does it matter that their merits are void provided
       progress is made? It is up to them to render their labor
       praiseworthy through their intention. Besides, by
       means of such labor they exercise and develop their
       intelligence, and it is from this aspect that they derive
       the greatest benefit.”


            Obstacles to Reproduction
693.   Are the human laws and customs that have as their objective
       or as their result the creation of obstacles to reproduction
       contrary to the law of nature?
       “Everything that hinders the operations of nature is
       contrary to the overall law.”
       – Nevertheless, there are species of living beings – both
       animals and plants – whose unrestrained reproduction would
       be harmful to other species, and of which humans themselves
       would soon be victims. Would it be wrong to hinder their
       reproduction?

                                395

                       Part Three – Chapter IV


       “God has given to humans – above all other living beings –
       a power that they should use for good and not for abuse.
       They may regulate reproduction according to their needs,
       but they should not hinder it unnecessarily. The intelligent
       action of humankind is a counterbalance set by God among
       the forces of nature to reestablish their equilibrium. This
       is what further distinguishes humans from the animals,
       because humans do so with full awareness. In their turn,
       the animals take part in this equilibrium. While the instinct
       of destruction has been given to the animals as a means for
       their own self ­preservation, it also causes them to hinder
       the excessive and perhaps dangerous over-population of
       the animal and vegetable species that nourish them.”
694.   What should be thought about means that are meant to
       prevent reproduction with a view to satisfying sensuality?
       “It proves the predominance of the body over the soul
       and demonstrates how deeply humans are immersed in
       matter.”


               Marriage and Celibacy
695.   Is marriage – the permanent union of two individuals –
       contrary to the law of nature?
       “It represents progress in the evolution of humankind.”
696.   What effect would abolishing marriage have on human society?
       “A return to the life of the animals.”
        The free and fortuitous union of the sexes belongs to the state of
        nature. Marriage is one of the primary acts of progress in human
        society because it establishes fraternal solidarity and may be found
        among all cultures, though under the most diverse expressions.



                                  396

                       The Law of Reproduction


         Abolishing marriage would therefore be a return to humankind’s
         infancy, and would place humans even below some animals that
         demonstrate examples of stable unions.

697.   Does the absolute indissolubility of marriage belong to the law
       of nature or is it only a human law?
       “It is a human law that is quite contrary to the law of
       nature. But humans may modify their laws; only those of
       nature are immutable.”
698.   Is voluntary celibacy a state of perfection that is meritorious in
       God’s sight?
       “No, and those who live that way out of selfishness
       displease God and mislead others.”
699.   Isn’t celibacy a sacrifice for certain individuals who desire to
       devote themselves entirely to serving humankind?
       “That is very different. I said ‘out of selfishness’. Every
       personal sacrifice is meritorious when it is made for the
       good – the greater the sacrifice, the greater the merit.”
         God cannot be self-contradictory or regard as evil what has been
         divinely made. Thus, God cannot see any merit in the violation of
         the Divine law. Even though celibacy per se is not a meritorious
         state, it becomes such when it constitutes a sacrifice made on
         behalf of humankind by the renunciation of the joys of family life.
         Every personal sacrifice with a view to doing good, and without
         selfish ulterior motives, elevates the individual above his or her
         material condition.



                            Polygamy
700.   Is the approximate numerical equality between the sexes an
       indication of the proportions in which they ought to be united?

       “Yes, for everything in nature has a final purpose.”
701.   Which of the two, polygamy or monogamy, is more in harmony
       with the law of nature?
       “Polygamy is a human law, and abolishing it is a mark of
       social progress. In God’s view, marriage should be based on
       the love of the individuals who join hands. In polygamy
       there is no true love; there is nothing more than sensuality.”
        If polygamy were in accord with the law of nature, it would be
        universal, which would be materially impossible due to the
        numerical equality of the sexes. Polygamy must be regarded as an
        institution or particular legislation appropriate for certain customs,
        but which social perfection will make disappear little by little.

 preservation • The Enjoyment of Material Things • Necessary
 and Superfluous Things • Voluntary Privation. Mortifications


          The Self-Preservation Instinct
702.   Is the self-preservation instinct a law of nature?
       “Absolutely. All living beings possess it, regardless of their
       degree of intelligence. In some it is purely mechanical; in
       others it is thought out.”
703.   What was God’s purpose in granting the instinct of self-
       preservation to all living beings?
       “All beings must collaborate in the designs of Providence.
       That is why God has given them the need to stay alive.
       Besides, life is necessary for beings to perfect themselves;
       they sense this instinctively without perceiving it.”


         The Means of Self-Preservation
704.   Since God has given human beings the need to stay alive, does
       God always provide them with the means of doing so?


                                 399

                       Part Three – Chapter V


       “Yes, and if they do not find them, it is because they do
       not understand them. God could not have given humans
       the need to stay alive without also having given them
       the means. Hence, the Creator has caused the earth to
       produce in such a way as to provide for the needs of all its
       inhabitants, for only that which is necessary is useful; the
       superfluous never is.”
705.   Why doesn’t the earth always produce enough to provide for
       humans’ needs?
       “Since they are ungrateful, they neglect her! Nevertheless,
       she is an excellent mother. Frequently, they blame nature
       for the consequences of their own incompetence or lack
       of foresight. The earth would always produce what is
       needed if humans knew how to be content. If she does not
       supply all their needs, it is because they use her to provide
       themselves with superfluities instead of necessities. Look
       at the nomads in the desert. They always find enough to
       live on because they do not create imaginary needs. But
       when half of all that is produced is wasted on satisfying
       fanciful desires, should people wonder at finding nothing
       the next day, and have a reason to pity themselves at
       being deprived in times of scarcity? In truth I tell you
       that nature is not stingy; rather, people do not know how
       to control themselves.”
706.   Should we understand only the products of the soil as being
       the fruits of the earth?
       “The soil is the original source from which all other
       resources derive because, in the last analysis, such resources
       are only a transformation of the products of the soil. For
       that reason we should understand the fruits of the earth to
       be everything that humans can enjoy in this world.”

                        The Law of Preservation


707.   The means of subsistence are frequently lacking for certain
       individuals, even in the midst of the abundance around
       them. To what is this fact due?
       “It is primarily due to the selfishness of humans, who do
       not always do what they should. Next, and most often, it is
       due to humans themselves. ‘Seek and you shall find’; these
       words do not mean that it is enough to simply look to the
       earth in order to find what you desire. Instead, you must
       seek with ardor and perseverance, without indifference and
       without allowing yourselves to be discouraged by obstacles
       that are quite often no more than means of putting your
       tenacity, patience and firmness to the test.” (See no. 534)
        If civilization multiplies our needs, it also multiplies the sources of
        labor and the means for living, but one must agree that in this sense
        there is still much to be done. When civilization has accomplished its
        task, no one will be able to say that they lack what is needed, except
        through their own fault. For many, misfortune happens when they
        choose a path nature has not traced out for them – and that is when
        they lack the intelligence required to succeed. There is a place in the
        sun for all, but on the condition that all take their own place and not
        that of others. Nature cannot be responsible for the vices of social
        organization and for the consequences of ambition and vanity.
        We would have to be blind, however, if we did not recognize
        the progress that the most advanced cultures have made in this
        sense. Thanks to the laudable efforts that philanthropy and
        science together have unceasingly put forth for the improvement
        of humankind’s material conditions, and notwithstanding the
        constant increase in population, insufficiency of production
        has been attenuated – at least for the most part – and the most
        calamitous years have no comparison to those in former times.
        Public hygiene, that element so essential to energy and health
        but unknown to our ancestors, is the object of an enlightened
        mindfulness. The unfortunate and suffering find places of refuge,
        and science has been put into action everywhere, contributing to



                                   401

                        Part Three – Chapter V


         the growth of everyone’s well-being. Might it be said that we have
         finally attained perfection? Oh, certainly not. But what has been
         accomplished so far has given us an idea of what can be done
         with perseverance if men and women are sensible enough to seek
         contentment in real and serious things, rather than in the utopias
         that cause them to go backward instead of advancing.

708.   Aren’t there situations in which the means of subsistence do
       not depend solely on human will and where the lack of the
       barest necessities is a consequence of circumstances?
       “These situations are frequently cruel trials which
       humans must undergo, and to which they know they will
       be exposed. Their merit is in their submission to God’s
       will if their intelligence does not furnish them with
       some means for escaping their difficulty. If death must
       touch them, they should submit to it without complaint,
       remembering that their hour of true freedom has arrived,
       and that despair at the final moment may cause them to lose
       the fruit of their resignation.”
709.   Have those, who in critical situations were obligated to
       sacrifice their fellow beings to appease their hunger, committed
       a crime? If it was a crime, was it lessened by the need to stay
       alive, which the preservation instinct has given them?
       “I have already responded in saying that there is more
       merit in undergoing all the trials of life with selflessness
       and courage. In this case, there is a homicide and crime
       against nature and it must be doubly punished.”
710.   On worlds where their physical makeup is purer, do the living
       beings have need of nourishment?
       “Yes, but their food is in keeping with their nature. Such
       food would not be substantial enough for your dense
       digestive systems; likewise, they would not be able to
       digest yours.”

                        The Law of Preservation


       The Enjoyment of Material Things
711.   Is the use of the fruits of the earth a right of all humans?
       “That right is a consequence of the need to stay alive. God
       would not impose a duty without granting the means to
       fulfill it.”
712.   Toward what end has God made the enjoyment of material
       things attractive?
       “To drive humans to fulfill their missions and also to test
       them with temptation.”
       – What is the purpose of such temptation?
       “To develop their reason so that they may learn to keep
       themselves from excesses.”
         If humans had only been driven to utilize the fruits of the
         earth because of their usefulness, their indifference could have
         compromised the harmony of the universe. God has given them the
         attraction of pleasure and this in turn incites them to accomplish
         the designs of Providence. However, through this same attraction,
         God also wills to test them with temptation, and this incites them
         to abuse; nonetheless, their reason should free them from it.

713.   Do enjoyments have bounds traced out by nature?
       “Yes, to show you the limit of what is necessary. But
       through your excesses you bring on satiety, and thus you
       punish yourselves.”
714.   What should be thought of those who seek to satisfy their tastes
       through all kinds of excesses?
       “They are unfortunate creatures whom we should pity and
       not envy because they are very close to death.”
       – Is it physical or moral death that they are close to?


                                  403

                          Part Three – Chapter V


       “Both.”
         Those who seek to satisfy their tastes through excesses of all kinds
         place themselves below the animals because animals at least know
         how to limit themselves to satisfying their needs. Such persons negate
         the reason that God has given them for their guidance, and the greater
         their excesses, the greater is the dominion they give their animal
         nature over the spiritual. The illnesses, ailments and death that result
         from abuse are also punishments for transgressing God’s law.



       Necessary and Superfluous Things
715.   How can people know the limit of what is necessary?
       “Those who are sensible know it by intuition, but many
       recognize it at the cost of their own experience.”
716.   Hasn’t nature traced out the limit of what is necessary in our
       own physical organization?
       “Yes, but people are insatiable. Nature has traced out the
       limits of their needs in their physical organization, but their
       vices alter their constitution and create artificial needs.”
717.   What should be thought of those who monopolize the fruits of
       the earth to procure for themselves what is superfluous at the
       expense of others who lack what is necessary?
       “They do not understand God’s law and will have to
       answer for the privations they have caused.”
         The line between what is necessary and what is superfluous is not
         absolute. Civilization has created necessities that do not exist in
         the primitive state, and the Spirits who dictated these precepts do
         not mean for civilized humans to live like primitives. Everything
         is relative and it is up to reason to place each thing in its proper
         place. Civilization develops moral sense, and at the same time, the
         sentiment of charity, which leads people to mutually support one


                                    404

                        The Law of Preservation


         another. Those who live at the expense of others’ privations exploit
         the benefits of civilization for their own profit. They have only the
         varnish of civility just as there are persons who possess no more of
         religion than its appearance.



       Voluntary Privations. Mortifications
718.    Does the law of self-preservation oblige us to provide for our
        own physical needs?
        “Yes, because without energy and health, labor is
        impossible.”
719.    Are we culpable if we seek our own well-being?
        “Well-being is a natural desire. God only prohibits abuse
        because it is contrary to self-preservation. God does not
        consider it a crime for you to seek your own well-being
        if it is not gained at another’s expense and if it does not
        weaken either your moral or physical strength.”
720.    Do voluntary privations that have an equally voluntary
        expiation as their purpose have any merit in God’s sight?
        “Do good to others and you will have greater merit.”
        – Are there any meritorious voluntary privations?
        “Yes, the privation of meaningless pleasures, because it
        frees you from matter and elevates your soul. Merit means
        resisting the temptation that drives you to excess and the
        taste for useless things, and it means taking from your own
        necessities in order to give to those in need. If privation is
        nothing more than pretense, it is only a mockery.”
721.    A life of mortifications through asceticism has been practiced
        since ancient times and among different cultures. Is it
        meritorious from any point of view?

                                   405

                        Part Three – Chapter V


       “Ask for whom it is useful and you will have your answer.
       If it only serves the one who practices it and if it hinders
       him or her from doing good to others, it is selfish,
       whatever may be the pretext under which it is disguised.
       Submitting oneself to privation by working for others is
       true mortification and is in accord with Christian charity.”
722.   Is the abstention from certain foods prescribed among various
       cultures based on reason?
       “Everything that humans can eat without harming their
       health is permitted. Lawmakers, however, have prohibited
       certain foods with a useful end in mind, and in order to
       give greater weight to their laws, they have represented
       them as having come from God.”
723.   Is humankind’s use of animals as food contrary to the law of nature?
       “With your present physical constitution, flesh nourishes
       flesh; otherwise, humans would perish. The law of self
       ­preservation imposes on you the duty to preserve your
        energies and health so that you may fulfill the law of labor.
        You should therefore eat according to the requirements of
        your own physical organization.”
724.   Is the abstention from foods – animal or otherwise –
       meritorious as an expiation?
       “Yes, if you deprive yourselves for the sake of others; but
       God cannot see mortification when there is no serious and
       useful privation. This is why we say that those who only
       seem to deprive themselves are hypocrites.” (See no. 720)
725.   What are we to think of the mutilations practiced on the body
       of humans or animals?
       “What is the point of such a question? Always ask whether
       a thing is useful. What is useless cannot be pleasing to


                                  406

                       The Law of Preservation


       God and what is harmful is always displeasing. You can
       be very sure that God is sensitive only to sentiments that
       raise the soul toward God. It is by practicing the divine
       laws instead of violating them that you can shake off the
       burden of your terrestrial matter.”
726.   If the sufferings of this world enable us to evolve – depending
       on the manner in which we bear them – may we also evolve
       through sufferings that we create intentionally?
       “Natural sufferings are the only ones that enable you to
       evolve because they come from God. Intentional sufferings
       serve no purpose when they have no value for the good of
       others. Do you believe that those who shorten their lives
       through superhuman hardships – the bonzes, fakirs, and a
       few fanatics of various sects – progress on their path? Why
       don’t they labor for the good of their neighbors instead? Let
       them visit the indigent, comfort those who mourn, work
       for those who are infirm, and endure privations to help
       the unfortunate; then their life will be useful and pleasing
       to God. When you only have yourselves in mind in the
       intentional hardships to which you subject yourselves, it is
       selfishness; when you suffer for others, it is the practice of
       charity. Such are the precepts of Christ.”
727.   Since we should not create intentional sufferings for
       ourselves that are of no use to others, should we nevertheless
       protect ourselves from those that we foresee or from those that
       threaten us?
       “The self-preservation instinct has been given to all beings
       against dangers and sufferings. Whip your spirit and not
       your body; mortify your pride and stifle your selfishness –
       that serpent devouring your heart – and you will do more
       for your progress than through self-inflictions that no
       longer have a place in this day and age.”

       • Necessary Destruction and Abusive Destruction
          • Destructive Calamities • War • Murder •
            Cruelty • Dueling • The Death Penalty



            Necessary Destruction and
              Abusive Destruction
728.   Is destruction a law of nature?
       “It is necessary for everything to be destroyed in order to
       be reborn and regenerated. What you call destruction is
       no more than transformation that is aimed at renewing
       and improving living beings.”
       – Has the destruction instinct been given to living beings for
       providential purposes?
       “God’s creatures are the instruments that God uses for
       attaining the divine ends. In order to feed themselves,
       living beings destroy each other with the dual purpose of
       maintaining the balance of reproduction – which might
       otherwise become excessive – and utilizing the remains of
       their external envelopes. But it is only the envelope that
       is destroyed; the envelope is only an accessory and not an

                                409

                       Part Three – Chapter VI


       essential part of the thinking being. The essential part is
       the indestructible intelligent principle, which is developed
       through the various metamorphoses that it undergoes.”
729.   If destruction is necessary for the regeneration of beings, why
       does nature surround them with the means of self­-preservation
       and conservation?
       “To prevent their destruction before the proper time. Any
       destruction that occurs too soon retards the development
       of the intelligent principle. That is why God has given to
       each being the need to stay alive and reproduce.”
730.   Since death should lead us to a better life and deliver us from
       the ills of this world, and should therefore be desired instead of
       dreaded, why do humans have an instinctive horror of it and
       see it as a cause for apprehension?
       “We have already stated that humans should seek to
       prolong their life in order to accomplish their task. That
       is why God has given them the self-preservation instinct:
       it sustains them in all their trials. Without it they would
       frequently give in to discouragement. The secret voice
       that tells them to avoid death also tells them they may yet
       do something more for their progress. Whenever danger
       threatens them, it is a warning to them that they must
       take advantage of the time God has granted them. But
       ingrates usually give thanks to their lucky star instead of
       their Creator.”
731.   Why has nature placed the agents of destruction side by side
       with the means of self-preservation?
       “The remedy beside the illness. We already have told
       you: in order to maintain balance and to serve as a
       counterweight.”

                       The Law of Destruction


732.   Is the need for destruction the same on all worlds?
       “It is in proportion to how material each particular world
       is; it disappears altogether in a purer physical and moral
       state. On worlds more evolved than yours, the conditions
       of existence are altogether different.”
733.   Will the need for destruction always exist for humankind on
       the earth?
       “The need for destruction diminishes among humans to
       the degree that their spirit overcomes matter. That is why
       you may observe that the horror of destruction follows
       upon intellectual and moral development.”
734.   In their present state, do humans have an unlimited right of
       destruction in regard to animals?
       “That right is limited to the need of providing for their
       food and safety. Abuse has never been a right.”
735.   What about destruction that exceeds the limits of need and
       safety: hunting, for instance, when it has no other objective
       than the pleasure of destroying needlessly?
       “It is a predominance of the animal nature over the
       spiritual nature. All destruction that exceeds the limits of
       need is a violation of God’s law. Animals only destroy to
       satisfy their needs, but humans, who have free will, destroy
       without need. They will be called to account for abusing
       the freedom granted to them because in such cases they
       yield to evil instincts.”
736.   Do those cultures that carry their scrupulousness to excess
       regarding the destruction of animals have any special merit?
       “Such excess is a sentiment that in itself is praiseworthy,
       but it becomes abusive and its merit is neutralized by other
       kinds of abuse. They act more out of superstitious fear


                                411

                        Part Three – Chapter VI


       than true humaneness.”

                Destructive Calamities
737.   For what purpose does God inflict humankind with destructive
       calamities?
       “To impel them to progress more quickly. Haven’t we stated
       that destruction is necessary for the moral regeneration of
       spirits, who accomplish a new degree of perfection during each
       new existence? You must see the end in order to appreciate the
       results. You only judge such things from your own personal
       point of view, and you regard such afflictions as calamities
       because of the injury they cause you. However, these hardships
       are often necessary in order to make things arrive at a better
       order more quickly, and to accomplish in a few years what
       would otherwise require many centuries.” (See no. 744)
738.   Couldn’t God employ other methods instead of destructive
       calamities for improving humankind?
       “Yes, and they are employed every day. Through the
       knowledge of good and evil, God has given to each of you
       the means of progressing. However, humans do not take
       advantage of them; thus, it is necessary to afflict them in
       their pride and make them feel their own weakness.”
       – But the moral person succumbs to these calamities along
       with the wicked. Is this just?
       “Throughout life humans relate everything to their body, but
       after death they think differently. As we have already stated,
       the life of the body is almost nothing – a century in your
       world is but a flash in eternity. The sufferings that last a few of
       your months or days are nothing, and are only a lesson that
       will serve you in the future. Spirits, who have preexisted and


                                  412

                        The Law of Destruction


       have survived everything else, comprise the real world (see
       no. 85). They are the children of God and the objects of the
       divine kindness. Bodies are no more than disguises behind
       which they make their appearance in the world. In the great
       calamities that decimate humankind, moral persons who
       succumb are like an army, which, during war, sees that its
       uniforms have become tattered, worn out or lost. The general
       is more concerned for his soldiers than their uniforms.”
       – But aren’t the victims of these calamities actual victims
       nonetheless?
       “If we considered life as it is in itself, and how insignificant
       it is in comparison with the infinite, the less importance we
       would attach to it. In another life, those victims will find
       ample compensation for their sufferings if they endured
       them without complaining.”
         Whether death results from a calamity or an ordinary cause, we
         cannot escape it when the hour for our departure has come. The
         only difference is that in the former case a greater number depart
         at the same time.
         If we could elevate ourselves through thought so as to encompass all
         humankind in a single glance, these terrible calamities would seem
         no more than passing storms in the destiny of the world.

739.   Are destructive calamities useful from a physical point of view,
       notwithstanding the hardships they cause?
       “Yes, they sometimes modify the conditions of a region,
       but the good that results from them is usually only felt by
       future generations.”
740.   Couldn’t calamities also be moral trials for humankind by
       exposing humans to the most afflictive needs?
       “Calamities are trials that furnish humans with an
       opportunity to exert their intelligence and to demonstrate


                                   413

                        Part Three – Chapter VI


       their patience and resignation before the will of God.
       At the same time, calamities enable them to develop the
       sentiments of self-­denial, self-detachment and love for
       their neighbor – if they are not dominated by selfishness.”
741.   May we avert the calamities that afflict us?
       “Yes, in part, but not as is generally supposed. Many
       calamities are the consequences of your own improvidence.
       As you acquire knowledge and experience you become able
       to avert them, that is, to prevent them if you know how to
       study their causes. Among the ills that afflict humankind,
       however, there are those of a general nature that belong to
       the designs of Providence, and from which all individuals
       receive, in a greater or lesser proportion, the share for
       which they are responsible. They can do nothing about
       these except resign themselves to God’s will. But even
       these ills are usually aggravated by human carelessness.”
        Among the destructive calamities that are natural and independent
        of human actions we find plagues, famine, floods, and the
        inclement weather conditions that are fatal to the productions
        of the earth. But in science, in works of art, in improvements
        of agriculture, in crop rotation and irrigation, and in the study
        of hygienic conditions, has not humankind found the means to
        neutralize or at least mitigate such disasters? Aren’t certain regions
        that were formerly devastated by terrible calamities protected
        nowadays? Therefore, what will humankind not accomplish for
        their material well-being when they know how to make use of all
        the resources of their intelligence, and when, caring for their own
        self-preservation, they know how to ally it with the sentiment of
        true charity for their fellow beings? (See no. 707)


                                 War
742.   What is the cause that leads humankind to war?


                                  414

                       The Law of Destruction


       “The predominance of the animal nature over the
       spiritual, and the satisfaction of their passions. In the state
       of barbarity, nations only know the right of the strongest,
       and that is why war is a normal state for them. As humans
       evolve, war will become less frequent since they will avoid
       its causes, and when it does become necessary, they will
       know how to make it more humane.”
743.   Will war someday disappear from the earth?
       “Yes, when men and women understand justice and
       practice God’s law. Then all nations will live as brothers
       and sisters.”
744.   What has been the goal of Providence in making war
       necessary?
       “Freedom and progress.”
       – If war is meant to bring freedom, why is it that it has usually
       had subjugation as its objective and result?
       “Temporary subjugation enables cultures to evolve more
       quickly.”
745.   What is to be thought about those who stir up war for their
       own gain?
       “They are truly guilty and will require many lives to expiate
       all the murders they have caused, for they will have to
       answer for every individual whose death they caused to
       satisfy their own ambition.”


                            Murder
746.   Is murder a crime in God’s sight?
       “Yes, a great crime because those who take the life of


                                 415

                       Part Three – Chapter VI


       another fellow being thereby cut short a life of expiation or
       mission – hence the evil.”
747.   Is there always the same degree of culpability in murder?
       “We have already said: God is just; God judges the intent
       rather than the deed.”
748.   Does God excuse murder in cases of legitimate defense?
       “Only necessity can excuse it; but if we can save our life
       without having to take the life of the aggressor, we must
       do so.”
749.   Are persons culpable for the murders they commit in war?
       “Not if they are coerced through force; nonetheless, they
       are responsible for the cruelties they commit. Likewise,
       their display of humaneness will also be taken into
       account.”
750.   Which is more culpable in God’s sight: parricide or infanticide?
       “They are both equally culpable, for all crime is crime.”
751.   Why is infanticide a custom condoned by legislation among
       certain cultures that are already evolved from an intellectual
       perspective?
       “Intellectual development does not necessarily imply
       moral development. Spirits of superior intelligence may be
       evil. They are the ones who have lived many lives without
       improving themselves.”


                            Cruelty
752.   May we link the sentiment of cruelty to the instinct of
       destruction?


                                416

                        The Law of Destruction


       “It is the destruction instinct in its worst form because,
       even though destruction is sometimes necessary, cruelty
       never is. It is always the result of an evil nature.”
753.   Why is cruelty the dominant characteristic of primitive peoples?
       “Among primitive peoples – as you call them – matter
       dominates spirit. They abandon themselves to their animal
       instincts, and since they do not have any other needs
       beyond those of the body, they care only about their own
       self­-preservation. This is what usually makes them cruel.
       Moreover, peoples of imperfect development are under the
       dominion of equally imperfect spirits. These imperfect spirits
       remain sympathetic to them until more highly advanced
       peoples come to destroy or weaken their influence.”
754.   Doesn’t cruelty result from an absence of moral sense?
       “You may say that the moral sense is not developed, but
       do not say that it is absent, since it exists in principle in all
       human beings. This moral sense is what later transforms
       them into good and humane beings. It exists in the
       primitive like the onset of the aroma in the bud of the
       flower that has not yet opened.”
         All faculties exist in humans in a rudimentary or latent state and
         develop according to how favorable the circumstances are. The
         excessive development of some impedes or neutralizes that of
         others. The overexcitement of the material instincts stifles (so to
         speak) the moral sense, as moral development gradually weakens
         the purely animal faculties.

755.   Why is it that in the most advanced civilizations there are
       individuals who are at times as cruel as barbarians?
       “For the same reason that on a tree loaded with good fruit
       there is always some that is rotten. Such individuals have,
       if you wish, only the appearance of civility, like wolves


                                  417

                              Part Three – Chapter VI


          in sheep’s clothing. Low order, very backward spirits, may
          incarnate among advanced people in the hope of their
          own progress. However, if the trial is too difficult, their
          barbaric nature prevails.”
756.      Will the society of moral individuals someday be purged of
          evildoers?
          “Humankind is evolving. Those who are dominated
          by the instinct of evil and who are out of place among
          moral people will disappear little by little – like bad grain
          being separated from the good when threshed – but they
          will be born again in other envelopes. Then, with more
          experience, they will comprehend good and evil better.
          You have an example in the plants and animals that you
          have learned how to perfect by developing new qualities
          in them. Very well, it is only after many generations that
          perfection becomes complete. This is a picture of the
          different existences of human beings.”


                                   Dueling57
757.      Can dueling be considered a case of lawful self-defense?
          “No, it is murder and an absurd custom worthy of
          barbarians. In a more advanced and moral civilization,
          people will understand that dueling is as foolish as the
          combats of antiquity that were regarded as ‘the judgment
          of God’.”
758.      Can dueling be considered as murder on the part of him who,
          knowing his own weakness, is almost certain to be killed?
 		The male gender language was maintained in this section, which deals with this obsolete
57

  19th century male-oriented custom. Actually, we continue to practice a more subtle form
  of dueling nowadays in our daily lives by using words and other antagonistic attitudes
  that are just as destructive – Tr.



                                          418

                          The Law of Destruction


       “It is suicide.”
       – And when the odds are equal, is it murder or suicide?
       “It is both.”
         In all cases, even in those in which the odds are equal, the dueler is
         culpable, first because he coolly and deliberately attacks the life of
         his fellow-man; second, because he exposes his own life needlessly
         and without benefit to anyone else.

759.   In dueling, what is the value of what is called “the point of
       honor”?
       “That of pride and vanity – two sores of humankind.”
       – But aren’t there cases in which honor really is at stake, and
       where refusal would be cowardice?
       “It depends on customs and usages. Each country and
       each epoch has a different way of regarding such matters.
       Nevertheless, when human beings are better and more
       advanced morally, they will understand that the true
       point of honor is above earthly passions, and that it is
       neither by killing nor by getting themselves killed that a
       wrong is redeemed.”
         There is more greatness and true honor in recognizing wrongdoing
         if we err, or in forgiving if we are right, and in all cases, in not
         attaching importance to insults that cannot harm us.



                    The Death Penalty
760.   Will the death penalty someday disappear from human
       legislation?
       “The death penalty will assuredly disappear and its
       suppression will signal progress for humankind. When


                                   419

                        Part Three – Chapter VI


       humans become more enlightened, the death penalty will
       be completely abolished on the earth. They will no longer
       need to be judged by others. I speak of a time which is still
       very distant for you.”
         Social progress still leaves much to be desired, but we would be
         unjust toward modern society if we did not see progress in the
         restrictions imposed on the death penalty among more advanced
         nations, and on the nature of the crimes to which its application is
         limited. If we compare the safeguards by which justice is enforced to
         protect the accused nowadays and the humaneness with which they
         are treated (even when found guilty) with what was practiced in
         the not-too-distant past, we cannot fail to recognize the path upon
         which humanity is progressing.

761.   The law of self-preservation gives us the right to defend
       our own life. Doesn’t this right apply when we eliminate a
       dangerous member from society?
       “There are other means of saving yourselves from danger
       without killing. Moreover, it is necessary to open the door
       of repentance to the criminal rather than to close it.”
762.   Although the death penalty may be banned from civilized
       societies, wasn’t it necessary in less-advanced times?
       “Necessary is not the right word. People always think a
       thing is necessary when they cannot find anything better.
       But as they become enlightened, they better understand
       what is just or unjust, and they repudiate the excesses
       committed in times of ignorance in the name of justice.”
763.   Is the restriction on cases in which the death penalty is applied
       an indication of the progress of civilization?
       “How can you doubt that? Doesn’t your spirit revolt when
       you read the reports of the human slaughters that were
       formerly perpetrated in the name of justice and frequently


                                   420

                      The Law of Destruction


       in honor of the Divinity; of the tortures to which the
       condemned and even the accused were submitted in order
       to wrest from them, through excess pain, a confession for
       a crime that they very often had not even committed?
       Well then, if you had lived in those times, you would
       have thought that it was all quite natural, and perhaps as a
       judge you would have done even more. It is thus that what
       seems just in one era seems barbaric in another. Only the
       divine laws are eternal. Human laws change with progress,
       and they will change further until they have been placed
       in harmony with the divine laws.”
764.   Jesus said, “Whoever kills by the sword shall perish by the
       sword.” Don’t these words represent the consecration of the
       penalty of talion? And isn’t the death imposed on the murderer
       an application of this penalty?
       “Be careful! You are as mistaken about these words as you
       are about many others. The penalty of talion is the justice
       of God; it is God himself who applies it. You all suffer
       this penalty at every moment because you are punished
       wherein you have sinned either in this life or in another.
       Those who have caused their fellow humans to suffer will
       be in a situation in which they themselves will suffer in
       like manner. This is the meaning of Jesus’ words. Didn’t
       he also say to you ‘Forgive your enemies?’ And didn’t
       he teach you to ask God to forgive your offenses as you
       yourself forgive, that is, in the same proportion in which
       you yourself have forgiven? Understand this well.”
765.   What about the death penalty imposed in the name of God?
       “It is equivalent to taking God’s place in the practice of
       justice. Those who act thus reveal how far they are from
       actually understanding anything about God, and how
       much they still have to expiate. The death penalty is a

                                421

crime where it is applied in the name of God, and those
who do so will be responsible for such murders.”

         The Law of Society
           • The Need for Societal Life • The Life of
          Isolation. The Vow of Silence • Family Ties



             The Need for Societal Life
766.   Is societal life natural?
       “Certainly. God has made humans for living in society;
       otherwise, it would have been needless for God to have
       endowed them with speech and all the other faculties
       necessary for a life of relationships.”
767.   Is absolute isolation contrary to the law of nature?
       “Yes, because people instinctively seek societal living
       and because all of them must cooperate in humankind’s
       progress by mutually helping one another.”
768.   In seeking societal living, do people only obey a personal
       sentiment, or is there a wider, providential purpose involved?
       “Humans must progress; they cannot do so alone, however,
       since they do not all possess every faculty – they need
       contact with others. In isolation, they become brutish and
       withered.”


                                   423

                        Part Three – Chapter VII


         No single individual possesses the complete range of faculties. It is
         through societal union that individuals complete one another in
         order to ensure their own welfare and progress. It is because they
         need one another that they have been created to live in society and
         not in isolation.



  The Life of Isolation. The Vow of Silence
769.   We can understand that as a general principle societal life
       is founded on the laws of nature. But since all tastes are
       also natural, why would a taste for absolute isolation be
       condemnable if someone finds satisfaction in it?
       “Selfish satisfaction. There are also those who find
       satisfaction in drunkenness. Do you approve of that?
       God cannot consider as pleasing a life in which persons
       condemn themselves to being useless to everyone.”
770.   What is to be thought of those who live in absolute seclusion
       in order to escape the pernicious contact of the world?
       “Doubly selfish.”
       – But if such seclusion has expiation as its purpose through the
       imposition of harsh privations, isn’t it meritorious?
       “Doing mostly good rather than evil is the best expiation.
       Through such seclusion they avoid one evil only to fall
       into another since they neglect the law of love and charity.”
771.   What should we think of those who renounce the world in
       order to devote themselves to the relief of the unfortunate?
       “They evolve by putting others’ needs before their own.
       They have the double merit of placing themselves above
       material pleasures and of doing good by fulfilling the law
       of labor.”


                                   424

                          The Law of Society


       – And those who withdraw to seek the tranquility required for
       certain kinds of labor?
       “That is not the absolute withdrawal of the selfish indi­
       vidual. They do not isolate themselves from society,
       because they labor for it.”
772.   What is to be thought of the vow of silence that has been
       prescribed by certain sects since remotest antiquity?
       “You might as well ask whether speech is natural and why
       God has given it. God condemns the abuse rather than
       the use of divinely-granted faculties. Nevertheless, silence
       is useful at times because in silence you can compose
       yourself; your spirit becomes freer and can enter into
       communication with us. However, a vow of silence is
       foolishness. Undoubtedly, those who regard such privations
       as acts of virtue have good intentions, but they are mistaken
       by not sufficiently understanding the true laws of God.”
         The vow of absolute silence, like the vow of isolation, deprives
         individuals of the societal relations that can furnish them with
         opportunities to do good and to fulfill the law of progress.



                         Family Ties
773.   Why is it that among the animals, parents and offspring no
       longer recognize each other when the latter no longer need care?
       “Animals live a material life, not a moral life. A mother’s
       tenderness for her young has as its principle the instinct
       of preservation regarding the beings born to her. When
       these beings are able to take care of themselves, her task
       is fulfilled and nature requires no more of her. Thus, she
       abandons them in order to occupy herself with more
       newborns.”

                       Part Three – Chapter VII


774.   There are persons who infer from animals’ abandonment of
       their offspring that the family ties among humans are merely a
       result of social customs and not a law of nature. What should
       we make of this?
       “Human beings have a different destiny than that of the
       animals, so why do you always want to identify with them?
       For humans, there is something beyond physical needs;
       there is the need to progress. Social ties are necessary for
       progress and family ties are summed up in social ties;
       hence, family ties are a law of nature. God has thus willed
       that humans learn to love one another as brothers and
       sisters.” (See no. 205)
775.   What would be the result for society if family ties were relaxed?
       “A magnification of selfishness.”

                   The State of Nature
776.   Are the state of nature and natural law the same thing?
       “No, the state of nature is the primitive state. Civilization
       is incompatible with the state of nature, whereas natural
       law contributes to the progress of humankind.”
         The state of nature represents the infancy of humankind and the
         departure point for their intellectual and moral development. Being
         perfectible and containing the seed of their own improvement
         within themselves, human beings are not meant to live forever in
         the state of nature, just as they are not meant to live forever in
         infancy. The state of nature is transitory, and humans leave it behind
         through progress and civilization. Natural law, on the other hand,
         rules humankind as a whole, and people improve to the degree that
         they comprehend and practice this law in a better manner.

777.   Since there are fewer needs in the state of nature, human beings
       do not suffer all the tribulations they create for themselves in
       a more advanced state. What is to be thought of the opinion


                                   427

                      Part Three – Chapter VIII


       of those who regard the state of nature as the state of perfect
       earthly happiness?
       “What do you expect? That sort of happiness is the
       ignorant happiness of the brute; there are humans who
       understand no other. It is being happy in the same sort
       of way as are the animals. Children, too, are happier than
       when they become adults.”
778.   Could humankind regress back to the state of nature?
       “No, humankind must progress without ceasing and it
       cannot return to the state of infancy. It progresses because
       God has willed it. Believing that it could regress back to its
       primitive condition would be denying the law of progress.”


               The March of Progress
779.   Do humans draw from within themselves the power to progress,
       or is progress nothing more than the result of education?
       “They advance naturally by themselves. Not all progress
       at the same time or in the same manner, however, and it
       is through social contact that the most advanced help the
       others to progress.”
780.   Does moral progress always follow intellectual progress?
       “It is its consequence, but it does not always follow it
       immediately.” (See nos. 192-365)
       – How can intellectual progress lead to moral progress?
       “By making good and evil understandable, for then
       humans can choose between the two. The development
       of free will follows the development of intelligence and
       increases the responsibility of humans for their acts.”


                                428

                         The Law of Progress


       – Then how can one explain that the most enlightened cultures
       are often the most perverted?
       “Complete progress is the goal, but like individuals,
       cultures only reach it step by step. Until they have
       developed the moral sense, they may use their intelligence
       to do evil. Morality and intelligence are two forces that
       only achieve balance over time.” (See nos. 365-751)
781.   Is humankind ever permitted to halt the march of progress?
       “No, but it can sometimes slow it down.”
       – What are we to think of those who attempt to halt the
       march of progress and cause humankind to regress?
       “They are poor conceited beings whom God will chastise, and
       they will be swept away by the torrent they meant to stop.”
        Since progress is a condition of human nature, no one has the
        power to oppose it. It is a living force that flawed human laws may
        hinder but not stifle. When these laws become incompatible with
        progress, it overthrows them along with all the persons who attempt
        to uphold them. This will continue to be the case until humans
        harmonize their laws with divine justice. Divine justice desires the
        good for all, unlike those laws that are made for the strong at the
        expense of the weak.

782.   Aren’t there those who obstruct progress out of good faith,
       believing they are helping it because from their own point of
       view they often see progress where it does not in fact exist?
       “They are like a tiny pebble under the wheel of a large
       cart; a tiny pebble cannot keep a large cart from moving.”
783.   Does the perfecting of humankind always follow a slow
       progressive march?
       “There is the regular slow progress that results from the
       force of things. However, when a culture does not advance


                                  429

                        Part Three – Chapter VIII


       quickly enough, then from time to time, God causes a
       physical or moral jolt that transforms it.”
         Humans cannot remain forever in ignorance since they must reach
         the goal set by Providence. They are enlightened by the force of
         circumstances. Moral revolutions, like social revolutions, creep
         into people’s ideas little by little. They germinate for centuries and
         suddenly burst forth, overthrowing the crumbling edifice of the past,
         which is no longer in accord with new needs and new aspirations.
         In such upheavals, people usually do not perceive more than the
         momentary disorder and confusion that affect their own material
         interests. Nevertheless, those who raise their thought beyond
         themselves admire the designs of Providence, which bring good out
         of bad. Such upheavals are like the storms and disturbances that
         leave the atmosphere cleansed after having disrupted it.

784.   Humankind’s perversity is very great. Doesn’t it seem like
       humans are regressing instead of progressing, at least from a
       moral point of view?
       “You are mistaken. Observe the whole closely and you
       will see that they are advancing because they have a better
       understanding of what evil is, leading them day by day
       to reform their abuses. The excess of evil will make them
       understand the need for the good and for reforms.”
785.   What is the greatest obstacle to progress?
       “Pride and selfishness. I am referring to moral progress,
       since intellectual progress is always occurring. Progress
       itself seems at first glance to double the intensity of these
       two vices by developing ambition and the love of wealth,
       but this in turn incites persons to pursue research that
       enlightens their spirits. It is thus that everything is related
       in the moral world as well as in the physical, and that
       good is brought out of evil itself. But this state of things
       will only last for a while. It will change as people better


                                   430

                          The Law of Progress


       understand that beyond the enjoyment of earthly wealth
       there is an infinitely greater and long-lasting bliss.” (See
       Selfishness, chap. XII.)
        There are two kinds of progress that mutually support each other,
        but which do not proceed in tandem: intellectual progress and
        moral progress. Throughout this century, intellectual progress
        among civilized cultures has received all the stimuli it could desire
        and has reached an unprecedented level. Moral progress has also
        occurred, although not at the same rate. If we compare the social
        customs of a few centuries ago with those of today, we would have
        to be blind to deny that there has been progress. Then why should
        the ascendant march of morality be interrupted any more than
        that of intelligence? Why should there not be as great a difference
        in morality between the nineteenth and twenty-fourth centuries
        as there has been between the morality of the fourteenth and
        nineteenth? To doubt this would be to assume that humanity has
        reached the apogee of perfection – which is absurd – or that it is
        not morally perfectible – which has been disproved by experience.



                    Relapsed Cultures
786.   History has shown us many cultures that relapsed into
       barbarity after shocking events deeply upset them. Where is
       the progress in such a case?
       “When your house threatens to collapse, you demolish it
       in order to build a stronger and more comfortable one.
       Until it is rebuilt, however, there is trouble and confusion
       in your dwelling.
       “A further example: you are poor and live in a hovel, but
       you become wealthy and leave it to live in a palace. Then,
       some poor fellow (as you formerly were) comes and takes
       your place in the hovel and feels very content because he


                                  431

                      Part Three – Chapter VIII


       previously had no shelter at all. Very well! Learn from this
       that the spirits incarnated in those declining cultures are
       no longer the spirits who had comprised them during
       their time of splendor. Because they have progressed,
       those former spirits have moved into even more perfect
       dwellings, while less advanced ones have taken their place,
       which they too will leave behind in their turn.”
787.   Aren’t there peoples that by their very nature rebel against
       progress?
       “Yes, but they are corporeally disappearing day by day.”
       – What will be the future fate of the souls who animate those
       peoples?
       “Like all other souls, they will finally arrive at perfection
       by passing through many, many existences. God deserts
       no one.”
       – So the most civilized individuals may have been primitive
       beings and cannibals?
       “You yourselves were such more than once before becoming
       what you are now.”
788.   Like individuals, cultures are collective individualities that
       pass through childhood, adulthood and decrepitude. Since
       this truth is attested to by history, doesn’t it lead us to assume
       that the most advanced cultures of this century will decline
       and end just as those of antiquity?
       “Those cultures that only live a material existence, and
       whose greatness is founded only upon power and territorial
       expansion, are born, grow and die out because the might
       of a culture exhausts itself just like that of an individual.
       Cultures with selfish laws that clash with the progress of
       enlightenment and charity die out because light annihilates


                                 432

                           The Law of Progress


       darkness and charity eradicates selfishness. However, for
       cultures, as for individuals, there is the life of the soul, and
       cultures with laws that are in harmony with the eternal
       laws of the Creator will live and will be guiding lights for
       other cultures.”
789.   Will progress someday unite all of earth’s peoples into a single
       nation?
       “Not into a single nation. That would be impossible
       because nationalities are formed based on different customs
       and needs arising from the diversity in climates, and their
       local laws are designed to accommodate such customs
       and needs. Charity, on the other hand, knows nothing of
       geographical latitudes and does not differentiate people
       by their color. When the law of God comprises the basis
       of human law everywhere, both cultures and individuals
       will practice the law of charity toward each other, living
       joyfully and peacefully because no one will attempt to
       deceive their neighbor or live at his or her expense.”
         Humankind progresses by means of individuals who increasingly
         improve and enlighten themselves. When these grow in number,
         they take the lead and draw the rest forward. Geniuses appear from
         time to time to provide an impulse, followed by individuals invested
         with authority, who, as instruments of God, enable humankind to
         advance many centuries in just a few years.
         The progress of cultures further highlights the justice of
         reincarnation. Moral individuals make praiseworthy efforts to
         help a nation advance morally and intellectually; the nation thus
         transformed will be happier both in this world and in the next.
         Nonetheless, during the slow march across the centuries, thousands
         of people die every day. What will be the fate of those who succumb
         along the way? Does their relative state of imperfection deprive
         them of the contentedness reserved for those who arrive last? Or is
         their happiness relative? Divine justice could not consecrate such an



                                   433

               Part Three – Chapter VIII


injustice. Through the plurality of existences, the right to happiness
is always the same for all, for no one is deprived of progress. Those
who live at a time of barbarity can return at a time of civility in the
same culture or in another one. It is obvious that all are benefited
by the ascendant march.
The theory of one sole existence, however, presents another
problem in this case. According to this theory, the soul is created at
the moment of birth; thus, if some individuals are more advanced
than others, it is because God has created a more advanced soul
for them. Why this favoritism? Why would these individuals, who
have not lived any longer than the ones before them – often not
as long – deserve to be given a more advanced soul? But even this
is not the main problem. Over a thousand years, a culture passes
from barbarity to civility. If human beings were able to live a
thousand years, one could conceive that they would have time to
progress during that time. But every day humans die at all ages.
Their numbers are constantly being replenished, with new ones
appearing and disappearing every day to such an extent that by the
end of a millennium, no trace remains of the former inhabitants;
the barbaric nation has become civilized. What is it that has actually
progressed? The individuals who used to be barbarians? But they
already died long ago. Is it the newly-arrived? Well, if their souls
were created at the time of birth, they could not have existed during
the time of barbarity. Thus, we would have to believe that the efforts
made to civilize a people do not have the power to improve imperfect
souls, but to cause God to create other souls who are more advanced.
Let us compare this theory of progress with the one that has been
given to us by the Spirits. The souls that come during the time of
civility have had their infancy like all the others, but they had already
lived many times before, and they arrive already advanced as the
result of previous progress. They come because they are attracted
to an environment which is sympathetic to them and which suits
their current state. Therefore, the efforts made to civilize a people
do not have the effect of determining the future creation of souls
who are more advanced but of attracting those who have already
progressed, whether they had already lived among that people in



                            434

                          The Law of Progress


         times of barbarity, or whether they have come from somewhere
         else. Upon this rests the key to the progress of all humankind.
         When all cultures are at the same level of morality, the earth will
         house only good spirits living in fraternal unity. The evil spirits,
         having been repelled and dislocated, will seek out less evolved
         worlds and an environment that suits them until they have made
         themselves worthy to come back to our transformed world. The
         usual theory, unlike that of reincarnation, has one further effect:
         works of social improvement only benefit present and future
         generations, but are meaningless for past generations, who were
         unfortunate because they arrived too soon and were able to
         advance only according to their own efforts and under the burden
         of their barbaric acts. According to the Spirits’ doctrine, however,
         later progress also profits those generations that are reborn into
         better conditions, and they can therefore perfect themselves in an
         environment of civility. (See no. 222)



                          Civilization
790.   Does civilization represent progress for humankind or does it
       represent decadence, as some philosophers profess?
       “Incomplete progress because humankind does not pass
       suddenly from infancy to maturity.”
       – Is it reasonable to condemn civilization?
       “Instead, condemn those who abuse it; don’t condemn the
       work of God.”
791.   Will civilization be purified one day so that the evils it has
       produced will disappear?
       “Yes, when morality is as developed as intelligence. The
       fruit cannot come before the blossom.”
792.   Why doesn’t civilization immediately effectuate all the good it
       could produce?

                                   435

                        Part Three – Chapter VIII


       “Because humans are not yet ready or disposed to obtain
       that good.”
       – Wouldn’t it also be because in creating new needs it incites
       new passions?
       “Yes, and because all of a spirit’s faculties do not evolve in
       tandem – everything takes time. You cannot expect perfect
       fruit from an imperfect civilization.” (See nos. 751-780)
793.   By what signs may one recognize a completed civilization?
       “You will recognize it by its moral development. You believe
       yourselves to be very advanced because you have made great
       discoveries and wonderful inventions, and because you are
       better situated and better clothed than primitives. However,
       you will only have the right to truly call yourselves civilized
       when you have finally banished the vices from your society
       that dishonor it, and when you finally live as brothers and
       sisters by practicing Christian charity. Until then, you are
       really no more than enlightened cultures that have passed
       through only the first phase of civilization.”
         Civilization goes through stages of development like everything
         else. An incomplete civilization is in a state of transition which
         engenders special evils unknown in the primitive state, but which
         nonetheless constitute a natural and necessary progress that brings
         with it the remedy for those very evils. As civilization perfects itself,
         it puts an end to some of the evils it has engendered, and all evils
         will eventually disappear with moral progress.
         Of two cultures that have reached the summit of the social scale, the
         one that may be called the more advanced, in the true sense of the word,
         is the one where the least selfishness, cupidity, and pride are found;
         where the customs are more intellectual and moral than material;
         where intelligence can develop with more freedom; where there is more
         kindness, good faith, and reciprocal benevolence and generosity; where
         the prejudices of caste and birth are less rooted, for such prejudices



                                     436

                            The Law of Progress


         are incompatible with true love for one’s neighbor; where the laws do
         not grant any special privileges and are the same for the last as for the
         first; where justice is administered with the least partiality; where the
         weak always find support against the strong; where human life, beliefs
         and opinions are better respected; where there are fewer unhappy
         individuals; and lastly, where persons of goodwill are always sure they
         will not lack the minimum of what is needed to live on.



       The Progress of Human Legislation
794.   Could society be governed solely by natural laws, without
       having to resort to human laws?
       “It could if humans understood them well enough. If
       they were to actually practice them, such laws would
       be sufficient. Society, however, has its requirements and
       needs special laws.”
795.   What causes the instability of human laws?
       “In times of barbarity, the strongest are the ones who make
       the laws and they frame them to their own advantage. It
       becomes necessary to modify them as humans comprehend
       justice more clearly. Human laws become more stable as they
       move toward true justice; that is to say, to the degree that they
       are made for all and as they are aligned with natural law.”
         Civilization has created for people new necessities that are related
         to the social position such people occupy. It has been necessary to
         regulate the rights and duties of such positions through human
         laws. Under the influence of their passions, however, humans have
         often created imaginary rights and duties that are condemned by
         natural law. Nations remove these rights and duties from their
         codes as they progress. Natural law is immutable and is always the
         same for everyone. Human law is variable and progressive, and only
         under such variable conditions at humankind’s infancy could it
         have consecrated the right of the strongest.

                      Part Three – Chapter VIII


796.   Aren’t harsh criminal laws a necessity in the present state of
       society?
       “A depraved society has a need for harsher laws.
       Unfortunately, such laws are meant to punish a wrong
       after it has already been committed, rather than to cut out
       the roots of what has caused the wrong. Only education
       can reform humankind, who will then have no more need
       of such harsh laws.”
797.   How can humankind be led to reform its laws?
       “This will occur naturally through the force of
       circumstances and by the influence of moral persons
       who will guide them along the path of progress. Many
       things have already been reformed and many more will
       be. Wait awhile!”


        Spiritism’s Influence on Progress
798.   Will Spiritism become a common belief or will it only be
       accepted by a few?
       “It will certainly become a common belief and will mark
       a new era in the history of humankind, for it belongs
       to nature itself. In fact, the time has come in which it
       must take its place among the other branches of human
       knowledge. It will nevertheless have to withstand great
       struggles – more against personal interests than against
       conviction – because you must not ignore the fact that
       there are persons interested in fighting it, some out of
       self-centeredness, others from purely material motives. Its
       opponents, however, will become more and more isolated
       and will finally be forced to think like the others, lest they
       make themselves look foolish.”

                           The Law of Progress


         Ideas are only transformed over time, never suddenly. They weaken
         from generation to generation, and end up disappearing along with
         those who have professed them, who are replaced by other individuals
         imbued with new principles, as is the case with political ideas in
         particular. Look at paganism. There are few today who profess the
         religious ideas of pagan times; nevertheless, many centuries after
         the advent of Christianity, they have left behind traces that only a
         complete renewal of humankind can erase. It will be the same with
         Spiritism. It has made considerable progress, but for two or three
         generations there will still be a phenomenon of incredulity that only
         time will erase. However, its forward progress will be more rapid than
         was the progress of Christianity because Christianity itself has opened
         the paths and has provided support for Spiritism. Christianity had to
         destroy; Spiritism has only to build.

799.   In what way can Spiritism contribute to progress?
       “By destroying materialism – one of the sores of society – it
       enables people to comprehend where their true interests lie.
       Since the future life is no longer veiled by doubt, men and
       women will better understand that they can ensure their
       future based on the present. Destroying the prejudices of
       sect, caste and color, Spiritism teaches them about the great
       solidarity that must unite them as brothers and sisters.”
800.   Shouldn’t we perhaps fear that Spiritism may not be able to defeat
       humans’ indifference and their attachment to material things?
       “To suppose that any cause could act as some kind of magic
       spell to transform humans would be to know very little
       about them. Individuals’ ideas are modified little by little
       and generations are needed to completely erase old habits.
       Transformation, therefore, can only be realized with time,
       gradually, step by step. With each new generation a part
       of the veil has been lifted, and Spiritism has now come
       to remove it once and for all. However, even if it had the
       effect of correcting the defects of only one person, it would


                                    439

                     Part Three – Chapter VIII


       be a step for that person and therefore a great good since
       that first step would make further ones easier.”
801.   Why haven’t the Spirits taught from the earliest times what
       they are teaching today?
       “You do not teach to children the same things you teach to
       adults, just as you do not give newborns food they cannot
       digest. Each thing has its own time. The Spirits taught
       many things that humans distorted or did not understand,
       but which they are now capable of comprehending. Even
       though their teaching was incomplete, they prepared the
       soil to receive the seed which is now about to bear fruit.”
802.   Since Spiritism must mark a step in the progress of
       humankind, why don’t the Spirits speed up this progress
       through manifestations that are so widespread and patent
       that they could lead the most incredulous to believe?
       “You desire miracles, but God has sown so-called miracles
       by the handful right under your feet; yet, you still have
       people who deny them. Did Christ himself convince
       his contemporaries by the wonders he performed? Even
       today, don’t you see those who deny the most obvious facts
       occurring under their very eyes? Aren’t there those who
       would not believe even if they did see them? No, it is not
       by miracles that God guides humankind. Out of divine
       goodness, God wishes to leave to it the merit of being
       convinced through reason.”

         The Law of Equality

       Social Inequalities • The Inequality of Wealth • The
       Trials of Wealth and Poverty • Equality of the Rights
          between Men and Women • Equality in Death



                       Natural Equality
803.    Are all people equal before God?
        “Yes, all tend toward the same goal; God has made the
        divine laws for everybody. You often say, ‘The sun shines
        the same on everyone’ and you thereby state a greater and
        more general truth than you might think.”
          All are subject to the same laws of nature; all are born with the same
          fragility; all are subject to the same sufferings; the bodies of the
          rich decompose like the bodies of the poor. Therefore, God has not
          granted a natural superiority to anyone either by birth or by death:
          all are equal before God.

                        Part Three – Chapter IX


            The Inequality of Aptitudes
804.   Why hasn’t God endowed everyone with the same aptitudes?
       “God has created all spirits equal, but each one of them has lived
       over a longer or shorter amount of time and has consequently
       developed more or fewer aptitudes. The difference lies in the
       degree of experience and volition – their free will – by which
       some advance more rapidly, endowing them a wide range of
       aptitudes. A medley of aptitudes is necessary so that all may
       contribute to the designs of Providence within the limits of
       the development of their physical and intellectual powers.
       What one cannot do, another does, and so all end up having
       their useful function. Furthermore, since all worlds are united
       in solidarity, it is necessary for the inhabitants of more highly
       evolved worlds – most of which were created well before
       yours – to come and live here in order to set an example for
       you.” (See no. 361)
805.   In passing from a more evolved world to a lesser one, does the
       spirit keep all its acquired faculties intact?
       “Yes, we have already told you that the spirit who has
       progressed cannot regress. In its spirit state it may choose
       a coarser envelope or a more precarious position than the
       previous one, but always to serve it as a lesson and to help
       it progress.” (See no. 180)
         Thus, the diversity of aptitudes among individuals is not related to
         the inmost nature of their creation, but to the degree of perfection
         they have reached as spirits. God has not, therefore, created an
         inequality of faculties, but has permitted the different degrees of
         development to remain in contact with one another so that the
         more advanced may help the more backward to progress, and also
         so that in needing one another, all persons may understand the law
         of charity that should unite them.

                         The Law of Equality


                   Social Inequalities
806.   Is the inequality of social conditions a law of nature?
       “No, it is the work of humankind, not of God.”
       – Will this inequality disappear someday?
       “Only God’s laws are eternal. Don’t you see inequalities
       disappearing little by little every day? They are destined
       to disappear together with the predominance of pride and
       selfishness, leaving only the different levels of merit. A day
       will come when the members of the great family of God’s
       children will no longer regard themselves as being of purer
       or less pure blood, because only the spirit is purer or less
       pure, and such does not depend on social position.”
807.   What about those who abuse the superiority of their social
       position by oppressing the weak for their own gain?
       “They are to be lamented, those wretched beings! They
       will be oppressed in their turn and they will be reborn
       into an existence in which they will suffer everything they
       caused others to suffer.” (See no. 684)


              The Inequality of Wealth
808.   Doesn’t the inequality of wealth originate in the inequality of
       faculties, which give to some persons more means of acquiring
       things than other persons?
       “Yes and no. What would you say about fraud and robbery?”
       – So, would inherited wealth be the fruit of evil passions?
       “What do you know about it? Go back to its origin to
       find out if it is pure. Do you know whether or not if at


                                443

                       Part Three – Chapter IX


       its source it was the fruit of spoliation or injustice? But
       apart from the issue of its possible evil origin, do you
       believe that the longing for wealth – even when honestly
       acquired – and the secret longing conceived to possess it
       as soon as possible are laudable sentiments? That is what
       God judges, and I can assure you that the divine judgment
       is more severe than that of humans.”
809.   If a fortune has been wrongly acquired to start with, are the
       heirs later responsible for this?
       “Of course, they are not responsible for the wrong that
       others committed, especially if they are ignorant of it. But
       you should know that a fortune is often destined for certain
       individuals in order to provide them the opportunity to
       repair an injustice. Happy for them if they comprehend
       this! If they repair the injustice in the name of the one
       who committed it in the first place, the reparation will
       be taken into account for everyone concerned, because it
       is almost always the original wrong-doer who, from the
       spirit world, inspires them to do it.”
810.   We may dispose of our assets more equitably or less equitably
       without breaking the law. Thus, are we responsible for our
       testamentary dispositions after death?
       “Every action bears its own fruit; the fruit of good deeds
       is sweet, whereas the fruit of other deeds is always bitter.
       Always bear this in mind.”
811.   Is absolute equality of wealth possible and has it ever existed?
       “No, it is not possible. The diversity of faculties and
       characters opposes it.”
       – Nevertheless, there are those who believe it to be the remedy
       for all social ills. What do you think of that?


                                444

                        The Law of Equality


       “Either they are framers of theories, or they are ambitious
       and envious. They do not understand that equality
       would be quickly broken by the very force of things.
       Fight selfishness, for that is your social plague. Do not
       run after chimeras.”
812.   If equality of wealth is not possible, does the same apply to
       well-being?
       “No, but well-being is relative and everyone could enjoy
       it if humans understood each other better, for true well-
       being consists in employing one’s time according to one’s
       liking, and not in working at something one does not
       enjoy. Since everyone has different aptitudes, no useful
       work would therefore be left undone. Equilibrium exists
       in everything; humans are the ones who upset it.”
       – Is it possible for everyone to understand one another?
       “Humans will understand one another when they practice
       the law of justice.”
813.   There are persons who fall into deprivation and poverty through
       their own fault. May society be held responsible for this?
       “Yes, we have already told you that society is always the
       primary cause of such wrongs. Isn’t it society’s responsibility
       to attend to the moral education of its members? It is
       frequently bad education that distorts these persons’
       judgment, instead of stifling their harmful tendencies.”
       (See no. 685)


       The Trials of Wealth and Poverty
814.   Why has God bestowed wealth and power on some and poverty
       on others?


                                445

                       Part Three – Chapter IX


       “In order to test everyone differently. Moreover, as you
       know, such trials are chosen by the spirits themselves, and
       they often fail at them.”
815.   Which of the two trials is more dangerous to humans: poverty
       or wealth?
       “They are equally so. Poverty provokes complaining against
       Providence, whereas wealth leads to all kinds of excesses.”
816.   If the wealthy endure more temptations, don’t they also have
       the means at their disposal for doing more good?
       “That is precisely what they do not always do. They
       become selfish, proud and insatiable. Their wants increase
       with their fortune and they never think they have enough.”
        An elevated position in the world and authority over our fellow
        beings are trials as great and risky as misfortune, for the wealthier
        and more powerful we are, the more obligations we must fulfill, and
        the greater are the means at our disposal to do good and evil. God
        tests the poor through resignation and the wealthy through the use
        they make of their wealth and power.
        Wealth and power awaken all the passions that attach us to matter
        and they keep us from spiritual perfection. That is why Jesus said,
        “Verily I say to you that it is easier for a camel to pass through
        the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
        heaven.” (See no. 266)



Equality of Rights between Men and Women
817.   Are men and women equal before God and do they have the
       same rights?
       “Hasn’t God given them both the knowledge of good and
       evil and the faculties for progress?”



                                  446

                           The Law of Equality


818.   Where does the moral inferiority of women in certain regions
       come from?
       “From the unjust and cruel dominion that men have
       exerted over them. It is a result of social institutions and
       the abuse of strength over weakness. Among men who
       have not advanced very much from the moral point of
       view, might makes right.”
819.   For what purpose are women physically weaker than men?
       “To assign special functions to them. Men are meant for rough
       work by being stronger; women for lighter work. But both
       mutually help each other in the trials of a life full of bitterness.”
820.   Doesn’t women’s physical weakness make them naturally
       dependent on men?
       “God has given strength to some in order to protect the
       weak, not to enslave them.”
         God has fitted the organization of each sex for the functions that
         it must perform. If God has given less physical strength to women,
         God has at the same time given them greater sensitivity in relation
         to the delicacy of the maternal functions and the fragility of the
         beings entrusted into their care.

821.   Are the functions for which women are intended by nature as
       important as those conferred upon men?
       “Yes, and even greater – women give men the first notions
       of life.”
822.   Since all people are equals before God’s law, shouldn’t they also
       be equals before human law?
       “This is the first principle of justice: ‘Do not do unto
       others what you do not want them to do unto you.’”
       – Accordingly, in order for legislation to be perfectly just, shouldn’t
       it consecrate the equality of rights between men and women?

                                   447

                       Part Three – Chapter IX


       “Equality of rights, yes; of functions, no. All persons
       must have a specific place and their occupations should
       reflect their aptitude. In order to be just, human law
       must consecrate the equality of rights between men and
       women. Any special privilege granted to one and not the
       other is contrary to justice. The emancipation of women
       accompanies the progress of civilization; their servitude is in
       step with barbarity. Besides, sex exists only in the physical
       organization, and since spirits can become either, there are
       no differences between them in this respect. Consequently,
       they should enjoy the same rights.”


                    Equality in Death
823.   Where does the desire to perpetuate one’s memory on funeral
       monuments come from?
       “The last act of pride.”
       – But isn’t the pompousness of funeral monuments most
       frequently determined by relatives who desire to honor the
       memory of the deceased, rather than the deceased him or herself?
       “It is the pride of the relatives who want honor for themselves.
       It is not always for the deceased that all these demonstrations
       are made, but for vanity, for consideration by the world, and
       for parading their wealth. Do you believe that the memory of
       loved ones is less lasting in the hearts of the poor just because
       they can only place one flower on their loved ones’ graves?
       Do you believe that marble can save from forgottenness those
       who had been useless while on earth?”
824.   Is funeral pomp completely reproachable?
       “No. When it honors the memory of a moral person it is
       just and sets a good example.”

                                  448

                 The Law of Equality


The grave is the place of meeting for all humankind – all human
distinctions are mercilessly ended there. The wealthy try in vain
to perpetuate their memory by means of ostentatious monuments.
Time will destroy these monuments just as it destroys their bodies –
nature has so willed it. The memory of their good and evil deeds will
be less perishable than their grave, and the pomp of their funerals
will neither cleanse away their meanness nor raise them one single
degree in the spirit hierarchy. (See nos. 320 ff.).

                    Natural Freedom
825.   Are there positions in the world in which persons can flatter
       themselves by believing they are enjoying absolute freedom?
       “No, because all of you, the least as well as the greatest,
       need one another.”
826.   What would be a condition in which humans could enjoy
       absolute freedom?
       “That of a hermit in the desert. As soon as two individuals
       are brought together, there are rights to respect and they
       no longer have absolute freedom.”
827.   Does the duty of respecting the rights of others deprive
       individuals of the rights pertaining to themselves?
       “Absolutely not, for they are rights that have been granted
       to them by nature.”

828.          How can we reconcile the liberal opinions of certain men with
              their frequent despotism in their own homes and over their
              subordinates?
              “In these instances, although they have an intellectual
              understanding of natural law, it is offset by pride and
              selfishness. They know what they should do, but they do
              not do it in practice – they make their principles a well-
              calculated farce.”
              – Will the principles they have professed during this life be
              taken into account in the next?
              “The more intelligence individuals have for
              understanding a principle, the less excusable they will
              be if they have not applied it to themselves. I tell you
              truthfully that simple but sincere persons are more
              advanced on God’s pathway than those who try to
              appear to be what they in fact are not.”


                                         Slavery58
829.          Are there human beings who are meant by nature to be the
              property of others?
              “Every instance of subjection of one human being to
              another is contrary to the law of God. Slavery is an abuse

 		The Spirits’ Book was published in 1857 while slavery was still legally practiced in many

  parts of the world, including the United States and Brazil. The U.S. State Department
  publishes an annual report entitled Trafficking in Persons that at present (2006) discloses
  the fact that 14 nations are not doing enough to stop international human trafficking.
     This report covers “severe forms of trafficking in persons” defined as: “a) sex trafficking in
     which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud or coercion, or in which the person
     induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or b) the recruitment,
     harboring, transporting, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through
     the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude,
     peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.” – Tr.

       of power and will gradually disappear with progress, as
       will all other abuses.”
         Any human law that establishes slavery is a law against nature
         because it equates people with animals and physically and morally
         degrades them.

830.   When slavery belongs to the customs of a culture, are those
       who practice it reprehensible since they are doing nothing
       more than following a usage that seems natural to them?
       “Evil is always evil. All your sophistry will not render an evil
       action good. However, the responsibility for evil is relative
       to the means at your disposal to comprehend it. Those
       who use the law of slavery are always guilty of violating
       the law of nature; but in this, as in all things, the guilt
       is relative. Because slavery was a custom among certain
       cultures, people practiced it in good faith as something
       that seemed natural to them. But their reason, more
       developed and especially enlightened by the teachings of
       Christianity, eventually showed them that the slave was
       their equal before God. Then, they had no more excuse.”
831.   Doesn’t the natural inequality of aptitudes place certain
       peoples under the subjection of the more intelligent ones?
       “Yes, in order to enable them to develop, but not to demean
       them still further by slavery. Human beings have long
       regarded certain races as domesticated beasts of burden
       equipped with arms and hands, and have thought that they
       had the right to sell them as such. They have considered
       themselves to be of purer blood. The folly of those who do
       not look beyond matter! It is not the blood that must be
       purer or less pure, but the spirit.” (See nos. 361-803)
832.   There are those who treat their slaves humanely, who allow
       them to lack nothing, and who think that freedom would


                                 453

                         Part Three – Chapter X


       expose them to even greater deprivations. What do you say
       about them?
       “I say that they understand their own interests very well.
       They also show the same care for their cattle and horses in
       order to get more profit at market. They are not as culpable
       as those who mistreat their slaves, but they nonetheless
       use them as merchandise, depriving them of the right to
       belong to themselves.”


                  Freedom of Thought
833.   Is there something in human beings which escapes all
       constraint, and through which they enjoy absolute freedom?
       “It is through thought that they enjoy unlimited freedom,
       for thought knows no obstacles. Its manifestation may be
       hindered, but not erased.”
834.   Are humans responsible for their thoughts?
       “They are responsible before God. God alone can know
       their thoughts and condemn or absolve them according to
       divine justice.”


                Freedom of Conscience
835.   Is freedom of conscience a consequence of freedom of thought?
       “Conscience is an inner thought that belongs to persons,
       as do all their other thoughts.”
836.   Do humans have the right to set up barriers to freedom of conscience?
       “No more so than to freedom of thought, because God
       alone has the right to judge the conscience. If humans


                                  454

                          The Law of Freedom


       use their laws to regulate relations between individuals,
       God uses the laws of nature to regulate relations between
       individuals and God.”
837.   What is the result of barriers to freedom of conscience?
       “It constrains individuals to act against their own way
       of thinking, turning them into hypocrites. Freedom of
       conscience is one of the characteristics of true civilization
       and progress.”
838.   Is every belief respectable, even when notoriously wrongheaded?
       “Every belief is respectable when it is sincere and leads to
       the practice of the good. Reproachable beliefs are those
       that lead to evil.”
839.   Are we blameworthy when we use our own beliefs to scandalize
       someone who does not think like us?
       “It shows a lack of charity and goes against freedom of
       thought.”
840.   Does it go against freedom of conscience to obstruct beliefs that
       might disturb society?
       “Acts may be restrained but inner belief is inaccessible.”
         Restraining the external acts of a belief when such acts cause harm
         to others does not go against freedom of conscience, for such
         repression leaves to the belief its entire freedom.

841.   Out of respect for freedom of conscience, should we allow the
       propagation of harmful doctrines, or may we without going
       against such freedom seek to lead back onto the path of truth
       those who have been led astray by erroneous principles?
       “Certainly you may, and you should. But to follow
       the example of Jesus, you must teach by gentleness and
       persuasion and not by force since that would be worse than


                                  455

                       Part Three – Chapter X


       the belief of the one whom you desired to convince. If
       there is something that ought to be imposed, it is goodness
       and fraternity; but we do not believe the means for doing
       so is violence: conviction cannot be forcefully imposed.”
842.   Since all doctrines claim to be the sole expression of the truth,
       by what signs can we recognize which one actually has the
       right to be presented as such?
       “It will be the one that produces the fewest hypocrites and
       the greatest number of moral individuals, which means they
       practice the law of love and charity in its greatest purity
       and widest application. By this sign you will recognize
       which doctrine is good, because those doctrines that result
       in sowing disunion and establishing divisions among God’s
       children can be only erroneous and harmful.”


                           Free Will
843.   Do humans act with free will?
       “Since they have freedom of thought, they have freedom
       of action. Without free will, human beings would be
       machines.”
844.   Do people enjoy free will from the moment of birth?
       “They have the freedom to act from the moment they
       have a will to act. During the first phases of life, freedom is
       almost non-existent. It develops and changes its objectives
       as the faculties develop. Since the thoughts of children are
       in proportion to the needs of their age, they apply their
       free will to things that are necessary for them.”
845.   Aren’t the instinctive predispositions that individuals bring at
       birth an obstacle to the exercise of their free will?


                                 456

                          The Law of Freedom


       “Instinctive predispositions arise from those of the spirit
       before its incarnation. Depending on how much the spirit
       has evolved, these predispositions can incite the individual
       to reprehensible acts, in which he or she will be aided by
       spirits who sympathize with such dispositions. However,
       there is no irresistible incitement if the individual has the
       will to resist. Remember: ‘where there is a will, there is a
       way.’” (See no. 361)
846.   Doesn’t our organism have an influence on our actions in life?
       If so, isn’t it at the expense of our free will?
       “The spirit is certainly influenced by matter, which may
       hinder its manifestations. That is why, on worlds where
       bodies are less material than on earth, the faculties develop
       with more freedom; however, the instrument does not
       give faculties to the spirit. Furthermore, in this case it
       is necessary to distinguish between moral faculties and
       intellectual faculties. If individuals have an instinct for
       murder, it is assuredly their own spirit that possesses it,
       and which transmits it to them – it never arises due to
       their bodily organs. Those who suppress their thought in
       order to occupy themselves with matter become like an
       animal, and even worse, since they no longer think about
       being on guard against evil. It is in this that they become
       culpable because they act in this manner of their own free
       will.” (See nos. 367 ff. Influence of the organism)
847.   Can a distortion of the faculties deprive humans of their free will?
       “Those whose intelligence is impaired by any cause are no
       longer in complete control of their thought, and thereafter
       they have no more freedom. Such distortion is frequently
       a punishment for the spirit, who might have been vain
       and proud and might have made bad use of its faculties
       in another existence. It may be reborn in the body of

                                  457

                       Part Three – Chapter X


       someone who is mentally impaired, as the despot in the
       body of a slave, and the spiteful wealthy person in that of a
       beggar. The spirit, however, is perfectly conscious of such
       constraint and suffers from it. It is in this constraint that
       one sees the action of matter.” (See nos. 371 ff.)
848.   Does the distortion of the intellectual faculties because of
       drunkenness excuse reprehensible acts?
       “No, because drunkards intentionally deprive themselves
       of their reason in order to satisfy their crude passions;
       instead of one wrong they commit two.”
849.   In humans in the primitive state, what is the dominant
       faculty: instinct or free will?
       “Instinct, which does not impede their acting with entire
       freedom in certain things. Like children, they first apply this
       freedom to their needs; it develops later through intelligence.
       Consequently, you, who are more enlightened than primitive
       peoples, are more responsible for your acts than they are.”
850.   Isn’t social position sometimes an obstacle to full freedom of
       action?
       “The world undoubtedly has its demands. God is just and
       takes everything into account, but holds you responsible
       for the paltry efforts you make to overcome such obstacles.”


                           Fatalism
851.   Is there fatalism in the events of life according to the
       usual meaning attached to the word; that is, are all events
       predetermined, and if so, what becomes of free will?
       “Fatalism only exists when applied to the choice made by
       spirits upon incarnating to undergo this or that trial. Upon

                                458

                         The Law of Freedom


       choosing a particular trial, they delineate for themselves a
       kind of destiny, which is the proper consequence of the
       position in which they now find themselves. I am referring
       only to trials of a physical nature. As for moral trials and
       temptations, spirits preserve their free will to choose good
       or evil and they are always able to yield or resist. When
       good spirits see individuals lose courage, they may rush
       to their aid but they cannot influence them to the point
       of eclipsing their will. An evil spirit, that is, a low order
       one, can disturb and frighten them by exacerbating a
       physical danger. Whatever the circumstances, however, the
       incarnate spirit still retains its entire freedom of choice.”
852.   There are persons who seem to be pursued by fatalism no
       matter what they do. Is it their destiny to be unfortunate?
       “There may be trials which they must endure and which
       they themselves have chosen. Once more you blame destiny,
       which is almost always a consequence of your own deeds.
       In the midst of the hardships afflicting you, make sure your
       conscience is clear. You will then feel partially consoled.”
        The right or wrong ideas that we form about things cause us to
        succeed or fail according to our character and our social position.
        We find it easier and less humiliating to our vanity to attribute
        our failures to fate or destiny rather than to our own fault. If the
        influence of spirits sometimes contributes to this, we can always
        free ourselves from it by repelling the ideas they suggest when such
        ideas are evil.

853.   There are persons who escape one mortal danger only to fall
       into another. They seem unable to escape death. Isn’t there
       fatalism in this?
       “Fatalism, in the true meaning of the word, applies only
       to the instant of death. When that moment arrives in one
       form or another, you cannot escape it.”


                                  459

                       Part Three – Chapter X


       – Then whatever may be the danger that threatens us, we will
       not die if our hour has not come?
       “No, you will not die, and you have thousands of examples.
       But when your hour for departure comes, nothing will save
       you. God knows beforehand what kind of death will cause
       your departure, and frequently your spirit also knows it
       because it was revealed to it when it made the choice of
       this or that existence.”
854.   From the infallibility of the hour of death, does it follow that
       the precautions taken to avoid it are useless?
       “No, because the precautions you take are suggested to
       you in order to avoid the death that could result from the
       dangers that threaten you. They are one of the means used
       so that it does not occur.”
855.   What is the intent of Providence in making us incur dangers
       that will have no result?
       “When your life is in danger, it is a warning that you
       yourself have desired in order to turn you from evil and
       to enable you to become better. Once you escape this
       danger, and while still under the influence of the risk you
       incurred, you consider with greater or lesser intensity –
       depending on the strength of the action of good spirits –
       to become a better person. However, once the evil spirits
       (I say evil in reference to the evil that is still in them)
       return, you think that you can dodge other dangers just
       as easily and you allow your passions to be unleashed
       once more. Through the dangers you incur, God reminds
       you of your weakness and the fragility of your existence.
       If we examine the cause and nature of any danger, we
       will see that in the majority of cases the consequences
       are punishment for some wrong committed or a duty


                                460

                         The Law of Freedom


       neglected. God thus warns you to reflect on and correct
       your wrongs.” (See nos. 526-532)
856.   Does the spirit know beforehand what kind of death it will suffer?
       “It knows that the kind of life it has chosen will expose it
       to dying more probably in one way than in another. But it
       also knows which struggles it will have to sustain in order
       to avoid it; and if God so wills, it will not succumb.”
857.   There are soldiers who brave the perils of combat with a
       certain conviction that their hour has not yet come. Is there
       any foundation for such confidence?
       “Quite frequently, individuals have a presentiment of their
       end and thus they may have a presentiment that they will
       not yet die. This presentiment is given to them by their
       protector spirits, who desire to warn them in order for
       them to be ready to depart, or in order to rebuild their
       courage at times when it becomes necessary. It may also
       come to them from their own intuition of the life they
       have chosen or of the mission they have accepted, and
       which they know they must fulfill.” (See nos. 411-522)
858.   Why do those who foresee their death generally dread it less
       than others?
       “It is the individual who dreads death, not the spirit.
       Those who foresee it think more as a spirit rather than as
       a physical entity. They understand their deliverance and
       they wait for it.”
859.   If death cannot be avoided when our hour arrives, is it the
       same in regard to all the accidents that occur over the course
       of our life?
       “They are generally small enough matters about which we
       can warn you by directing your thought in such a way that


                                 461

                       Part Three – Chapter X


       you may avoid them, for we do not like physical suffering.
       However, this is of little importance for the course of the life
       you have chosen. Actually, bona fide fatalism applies only at
       the times when you must enter and depart this world.”
       – Are there events which must necessarily occur, and which
       the will of the spirits cannot avert?
       “Yes, but which you, when in the spirit state, foresaw and
       anticipated upon making your choice. However, do not
       believe that everything that happens to you is ‘written’, as
       some say. An event is almost always the consequence of
       something you have done by an act of your own free will
       in such a way that if you had not done so, the event would
       not have occurred. If you burn your finger, it is only the
       consequence of your imprudence and the condition of
       matter. Only the great sorrows – those important events
       that are capable of influencing your moral evolution –
       are foreseen by God because they are useful for your
       purification and education.”
860.   Can humans through their own will and efforts avoid events
       that were to occur, and vice-versa?
       “They can, if this apparent deviation fits into the general
       order of the life that they have chosen. Furthermore, in
       doing good – their duty and the sole purpose of life – they
       can prevent evil, especially that which might contribute to
       a still greater evil.”
861.   Upon choosing their existence, do those who commit a murder
       know at the time that they would become murderers?
       “No. They only know that in choosing a life of struggle
       they will incur the probability of killing one of their fellow
       beings, but they do not know if they will actually do so or
       not. Murderers will almost always deliberate in their minds


                                462

                        The Law of Freedom


       before committing the crime, and those who deliberate
       about something are always free to do it or not. If spirits
       knew beforehand that as individuals they would have to
       commit a murder, it would mean they were predestined
       to do so. However, you should be very clear about the fact
       that no one is ever predestined to commit a crime, and
       that every crime, like any and every other act, is always
       the result of volition and free will. Moreover, you always
       confuse two very distinct things: the material events of
       existence and the moral acts of life. If there is sometimes
       fatalism, it only applies to material events where the cause
       is outside of you and independent of your will. As for
       the acts of the moral life, they always emanate from the
       individual him or herself, who therefore always has the
       freedom of choice. There is never fatalism in such acts.”
862.   There are those who never manage to succeed, who seem to be
       pursued by a bad influence in all their undertakings. Isn’t this
       what we could call fatalism?
       “It could be fatalism if you would like to call it that,
       but it results from the choice of the kind of existence.
       Such individuals wanted to experience a life full of
       disappointment in order to exercise their patience and
       resignation. However, you must not believe that this
       fatalism is always unavoidable. It is often only the result
       of their having taken a wrong path that is not in keeping
       with their intelligence and aptitudes. Someone who tries
       to swim across a river without knowing how to swim
       stands a very good chance of drowning. It is the same in
       most events of life. If people did not try to undertake more
       than what was in keeping with their own faculties they
       would always succeed. What causes their failure are their
       self-centeredness and ambition, which divert them from


                                463

                        Part Three – Chapter X


       their proper path and make them consider a vocation that
       entails nothing but the desire to satisfy certain passions.
       They then fail and it is their own fault; but instead of
       recognizing their error, they prefer to blame their
       horoscope. For instance, a man would have been a good
       workman making an honorable living, but he became a
       bad poet instead and died of hunger. There would be a
       place for everybody if each one knew how to occupy his
       or her own niche.”
863.   Don’t social customs often obligate people to follow a certain
       path rather than another? And aren’t they subject to the
       influence of others’ opinions in their choice of occupation? Isn’t
       what we call human respect actually an obstacle to the exercise
       of our free will?
       “Social customs are made by humans, not by God; if they
       submit to them, it is because they suit them. This is also
       an act of free will, because if they wanted to, they could
       reject them. So why do they complain? They should not
       accuse social customs, but their own foolish vanity, which
       leads them to prefer to die of hunger rather than infringe
       upon such customs. Nobody takes this sacrifice to public
       opinion into account, though God will take into account
       their sacrifice to their own vanity. This does not mean they
       should unnecessarily go against public opinion, like certain
       persons who are more possessed of eccentricity than true
       philosophy. It is just as absurd to display oneself as an oddity
       as it is wise to willingly descend the social ladder without
       complaining if one cannot remain at the top.”
864.   If there are persons whom fate seems to be against, others seem
       to be favored by it because everything goes well for them. To
       what may this be attributed?
       “Usually, they are better at self-guidance. However, it

                                 464

                         The Law of Freedom


       could also be a kind of trial: success intoxicates them; they
       trust in their destiny and later they frequently pay for their
       success with cruel reversals that could have been avoided
       with a little prudence.”
865.   How can we explain the luck that seems to favor certain
       individuals in circumstances that depend neither on will nor
       intelligence – games of chance, for example?
       “Certain spirits have chosen certain types of pleasure
       beforehand, and the luck that favors them is a temptation.
       Those who win in the material sense might lose as spirits –
       it is a trial for their pride and greed.”
866.   Then wouldn’t the fatalism that seems to preside over our
       destinies in the material life also be the result of our free will?
       “You yourselves have chosen your trials. The more difficult
       they are and the better you bear them, the more you evolve.
       Those who spend their lives in the selfish enjoyment of
       abundance and their own welfare are cowardly spirits who
       remain at a standstill. Thus, the number of the unfortunate
       greatly surpasses the fortunate, since the majority of spirits
       have sought the trials that will be most useful to them.
       They see too clearly the futility of earthly grandeurs and
       pleasures. Besides, the most satisfactory life is always full of
       events and its own problems to solve, even in the absence
       of suffering.” (See nos. 525 ff.)
867.   Where does the expression “born under a lucky star” come from?
       “It comes from an old superstition, according to which
       the stars were connected with the destiny of each human
       being – an allegory that some people are foolish enough
       to take literally.”




                                  465

                        Part Three – Chapter X


           Foreknowledge of the Future
868.   Can the future be revealed to humans?
       “In principle, the future is hidden from them and only
       in rare and exceptional cases does God permit it to be
       revealed.”
869.   For what purpose is the future hidden from them?
       “If they knew the future, they would neglect the present and
       they would not act with the same freedom, because they
       would be dominated by the thought that if a certain thing
       must happen it is no use being concerned about it; otherwise,
       they would try to prevent it. God has willed it to be this way
       so that each one may contribute to the accomplishment of
       things, even those that he or she would like to thwart. Thus, it is
       that you yourselves unknowingly prepare the events that will
       occur over the course of your lives.”
870.   But if it is useful for the future to remain hidden, why does
       God sometimes allow it to be revealed?
       “This happens if a particular foreseen event would facilitate
       the accomplishment of things instead of preventing them,
       and if it leads individuals to act differently than they would
       have if the revelation had not been made. Besides, many
       times it is a trial. The anticipation of an event may awaken
       thoughts that are more virtuous or less so. For instance,
       if a man knows that he will receive a fortune that he had
       not expected, he may be taken by the sentiment of greed
       or elation about the probability of adding to his earthly
       pleasures. In order to obtain the fortune sooner, he may
       then desire the death of the one who is to leave it to him.
       On the other hand, perhaps such anticipation will awaken
       good sentiments and generous thoughts in him. If the


                                  466

                           The Law of Freedom


       prediction is not fulfilled, it will be another trial: the way
       in which he bears the disappointment; nonetheless, he will
       have acquired the merit or the blame for the good or bad
       thoughts that the prediction aroused in him.”
871.   Since God knows everything, God knows whether a person will
       or will not fail in a particular trial. If that is the case, what is the
       need of the trial in the first place, since it cannot add anything to
       what God does not already know about that person?
       “You might as well ask why God did not create human
       beings perfect and accomplished to begin with (see no. 119)
       or why they must pass through childhood before arriving
       at adulthood (see no. 379). The purpose of a trial is not
       to enlighten God about what people deserve – God knows
       perfectly well what they deserve – but to leave them the
       entire responsibility for their own conduct since they have
       the freedom to do or not do. Since they can choose between
       good and evil, a trial has the purpose of placing them before
       the temptation of evil, leaving them all the merit for resisting
       it. Also, even though God knows very well beforehand
       whether they will triumph or fail, out of divine justice God
       can neither punish them nor reward them for an act they
       have not yet committed.” (See no. 258)
         It is the same among humans. However capable aspirants may
         be and no matter how certain they are of success, they cannot be
         granted any diploma without first being tested, i.e. without trial. In
         the same way, a judge does not condemn the accused except with
         proof that a crime was actually committed and not by the prediction
         that the accused can or might commit such act in the future.
         The more we reflect on the consequences that the knowledge of
         the future would have for humans, the more we see how wise
         Providence was to conceal it. The certainty of a happy event would
         result in inaction; an unpleasant event, in discouragement; in
         either case, our efforts would be paralyzed. This is why the future


                                    467

                         Part Three – Chapter X


         is not shown to humans except as a goal they must reach through
         their own efforts, but without knowing the tribulations they must
         go through in order to reach it. Knowing about all the incidents
         they might encounter along the way would deprive them of their
         initiative and the use of their free will. They would let themselves be
         dragged down the fatal slope of events without exercising their own
         faculties. When the success of a matter is assured, no one is worried
         about it any longer.



   A Theoretical Summary on the Driving
       Force behind Human Actions
872.   The issue of free will may be summed up as follows: humans
       are not fatally led into evil; their acts are not “written”
       beforehand; the crimes they commit are not the result of
       any decree of destiny. As a trial and an expiation, they can
       choose an existence in which they will feel induced to crime,
       whether through the surroundings in which they are placed,
       or whether through the circumstances that supervene; but
       they will always be free to act as they wish. Free will exists
       in the spirit state in the choice of trials, and in the corporeal
       life in the ability of yielding to or resisting the temptations
       to which they have voluntarily submitted themselves. It is
       the duty of education to combat evil tendencies and it will
       effectively do so when it is based on an in-depth study of
       the human moral nature. Through the knowledge of the laws
       that govern this moral nature, humans will manage to modify
       it, as intelligence is modified through education, and physical
       constitution through bodily care.
       When disconnected from matter and in the errant state,
       the spirit makes the choice of its future corporeal existence
       according to the degree of perfection it has reached. It is in


                                    468

                   The Law of Freedom


this, as we have stated, that its free will especially consists. This
freedom is not annulled by incarnation. If the spirit yields to
the influence of matter, it fails in the trials it has chosen for
itself. In order to help overcome them, however, it can invoke
the assistance of God and good spirits. (See no. 337)
Without free will, humans would be neither guilty in evil
nor meritorious in goodness. This is so true that in the world
censure or praise always depends on intent, that is, on the will
of individuals. Those who say will actually mean freedom.
Therefore, people could not seek excuses in their physical
makeup for their wrongs without abdicating reason and the
human condition itself, and without equating themselves
with the brute. If this can be applied to evil, it applies to the
good as well. But whenever people practice the good, they take
great care to attribute the merit to their favor. They do not
attribute it to their organs, a fact which, notwithstanding the
opinion of a few theoreticians, proves that they instinctively
do not renounce the most glorious privilege of their species:
freedom of thought.
Fatalism, as commonly understood, implies a prior and
irrevocable ordaining of all the events of life, whatever their
importance may be. If that were the order of things, human
beings would be like machines deprived of will. Of what use
would their intelligence be if they were invariably overruled
in all their actions by the force of destiny? Such a doctrine, if
true, would represent the destruction of all human freedom.
Individuals would have no responsibility for their actions,
and as a result, there would be no evil, no crime, no virtue.
God, being supremely just, could not chastise God’s creatures
for wrongs that did not depend on them to start with, or
reward them for virtues for which they had no merit. Such
a law would be a further negation of the law of progress,


                           469

                Part Three – Chapter X


because people who would depend on fate for everything
would try to do nothing to improve their position since they
could make it neither better nor worse.
However, fatalism is not a meaningless word. It really does
apply in regard to the position of individuals on the earth
and the functions they perform on it as a consequence
of the kind of existence that their spirit had chosen as
a trial, an expiation or a mission. They fatally undergo
all the tribulations of that existence and all the good or
bad tendencies inherent to it. But at this point fatalism
ceases, for it depends on their will to yield or not to yield
to those tendencies. The details of events depend on the
circumstances that humans themselves create with their
deeds, and on those that spirits influence through the
thoughts they suggest to them. (See no. 459)
There is fatalism, therefore, in the events that are presented to
people as a consequence of the choice of existence made by
their spirit. However, there can be no fatalism in the results
of such events, because it may depend on them to modify the
course of things through their own prudence. Furthermore,
fatalism never applies to the acts of the moral life.
It is in death that people are subjected absolutely and
inexorably to the law of fatalism, for they cannot evade
the decree that has fixed the term of their existence or the
kind of death that must interrupt its course.
According to common belief, human beings derive all of
their instincts from themselves. These would proceed either
from their physical organization, for which they would not
be responsible, or from their own nature, in which they could
seek an excuse for themselves by saying that it is not their
fault for having been made like that. The Spiritist Doctrine


                          470

                  The Law of Freedom


obviously looks at it from a moral standpoint by admitting
free will for humans in all its fullness. It tells them that if
they practice evil, or if they yield to an evil suggestion that
comes from outside themselves, they are still fully responsible
because the Doctrine recognizes their power to resist,
something obviously easier than to struggle against their own
nature. Thus, according to the Spiritist Doctrine there are no
irresistible temptations. People can always close their ears to
the secret voice that induces them to commit evil, just as they
can close them to the physical voice of someone who speaks
to them. They can do so through their will, asking God for
strength and pleading for the assistance of good spirits. This
is what Jesus teaches in the sublime plea of the Lord’s Prayer,
commanding us to say, “Do not let us fall into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.”
This theory of the driving force behind our acts obviously
stands out among all the teachings given by the Spirits. It is
not only sublime as to morality, but we will add that it also
elevates humans in their own eyes, leaving them free to shake
off the yoke of an obsessor, just as they are able to close their
door to intruders. Thus, they are no longer machines acting
on an impulse foreign to their own will, but instead they are
rational beings, who listen, judge and freely choose between
two counsels. Let us add that in spite of this, humans are not
deprived of initiative; they do not fail to act except on their
own impulse, because in reality they are still incarnate spirits
who preserve under the corporeal envelope the qualities and
defects they had as spirits. Therefore, the wrongs we commit
have their primary origin in the imperfections of our own
spirit, who has not yet reached the moral superiority to which
it is destined, but who nevertheless does not lack free will.
Corporeal life is given to it so that it may purge itself of its
imperfections through the trials it undergoes during life, and

                          471

                  Part Three – Chapter X


it is precisely such imperfections that weaken it and render it
more accessible to the suggestions of other imperfect spirits,
who take advantage of the fact in order to make it succumb
in the struggle that it has undertaken. If the spirit emerges
victorious from this struggle, it evolves; if it fails, it remains as
it was – no worse, no better. It is a trial which it will have to
start over and which it may have to endure for a long time.
The more it purifies itself, the more it decreases its weaknesses
and the less accessible it becomes to those who tempt it to
evil. Its moral strength increases due to its progress and evil
spirits withdraw from it.
All spirits, who are more or less good when incarnate,
comprise the human species, and since earth is one of the
least advanced worlds, there are more evil spirits here than
good ones. That is why we see so much wickedness. So let
us make every effort not to have to return to this world
after our present sojourn and to deserve repose on a better
world, one of those privileged worlds, where goodness
reigns completely and where we will remember our stay
on this planet as merely a time of exile.

          Love and Charity
• Justice and Natural Rights • The Right of Ownership. Theft •
Charity and Love for Our Neighbor • Maternal and Filial Love



             Justice and Natural Rights
873.   Is the sentiment of justice to be found in nature itself or is it
       the result of acquired ideas?
       “It is so natural that you revolt at the thought of an
       injustice. Moral progress undoubtedly develops this
       sentiment, but it does not create it – God has placed it in
       the human heart. That is why you frequently find among
       simple and unlearned people notions of justice that are
       more exact than those among very knowledgeable ones.”
874.   If justice is a law of nature, how may it be explained that
       people understand it so differently, and that what one
       individual considers just appears unjust to another?
       “It is because the passions are usually mingled with the
       sentiment of justice, thereby altering it. The same thing
       occurs with the majority of the other natural sentiments

                                 473

                         Part Three – Chapter XI


       and it causes things to be seen from an erroneous point
       of view.”
875.   How may justice be defined?
       “Justice consists in respecting the rights of others.”
       – What determines these rights?
       “They are determined by two things: human law and
       natural law. Because humans have established laws that
       are appropriate for their customs and character, such
       laws have established rights that can vary with progress.
       Though your current laws are not perfect, they do not
       consecrate the same rights as the laws of the Medieval Era,
       for instance. Even though those rights seem monstrous to
       you and are now obsolete, they seemed just and natural at
       the time. Therefore, the rights established by humans do
       not always conform to justice. They only regulate certain
       social relations, whereas in private life there are a huge
       number of actions that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the
       court of conscience.”
876.   Outside the rights consecrated by human law, what is the
       basis of justice founded on natural law?
       “Christ has told you: ‘Do unto others whatsoever you would
       have them do unto you.’ God has placed in the human heart
       the rule of all true justice through the desire that all have to
       see their rights respected. If you are uncertain of what you
       should do for your neighbor in any given circumstance, ask
       yourself what you would want your neighbor to do to you
       in a similar situation. God could not give you a safer guide
       than your own conscience.”
         In fact, the criterion of true justice is in desiring for others what we
         would desire for ourselves; it is not in desiring for ourselves what we
         would desire for others, which is not the same thing. Since it is not


                                    474

                  The Law of Justice, Love and Charity


         natural to desire our own harm, then if we take our personal desire
         as the norm or starting point, we can be certain that we will never
         do anything for our neighbor except what is good. In all ages and in
         all belief systems, humans have always sought to enforce their own
         personal rights. The sublimity of the Christian religion was to take
         personal rights as the basis for the rights of the neighbor.

877.   Does the necessity of living in society impose any special
       obligations on humankind?
       “Yes, and the first of all is that of respecting the rights of
       others; those who respect the rights of others will always
       be just. In your world, where so many do not practice
       the law of justice, everyone resorts to reprisals, and that is
       what causes trouble and confusion in your society. Social
       life bestows rights and imposes reciprocal duties.”
878.   Since humans can be mistaken as to the extent of their rights,
       what guideline can enable them to know what limits to set on
       such rights?
       “The limit of the right that each one recognizes for his or
       her neighbor in relation to him or herself under the same
       circumstances, and vice-versa.”
       – But if all attributed to themselves the rights of their neighbor,
       what becomes of subordination to superiors? Wouldn’t that
       cause anarchy regarding all positions of power?
       “Natural rights are the same for everybody from the least to
       the greatest. God has not made some from purer clay than
       others and all are equal in the divine sight. These rights are
       eternal, whereas those established by humans perish with
       their institutions. Moreover, all individuals sense their
       own strength or weakness and will always show a certain
       deference to those who deserve it because of their virtue
       and wisdom. It is important to point this out so that those
       who think they are superior may know their duties and

                                   475

                         Part Three – Chapter XI


       may deserve such deference. Subordination will never be
       compromised if authority is in conformance with wisdom.”
879.   What would be the character of those who practice justice in
       all its purity?
       “They would be truly just and would be following Jesus’
       example because they would practice both charity and
       love towards their neighbor, without which there is no
       real justice.”


        The Right of Ownership. Theft
880.   Which is the first of all the natural rights of humans?
       “The right to stay alive. That is why no one has the right
       to assault a fellow human being’s life or to do anything
       that may compromise his or her corporeal existence.”
881.   Does the right to stay alive give them the right to accumulate
       what is needed to live on and to retire when they can no
       longer work?
       “Yes, but they must do this as a family – like the bee –
       through honest labor, and not by accumulating assets as
       selfish individuals. Certain animals set an example of such
       foresight.”
882.   Do humans have the right to defend what they have
       accumulated through their labor?
       “Hasn’t God said, ‘Do not steal?’ and Jesus, ‘Render unto
       Caesar what is Caesar’s?’”
         Assets that humans accumulate through honest labor are legitimate
         property and they have the right to defend it because ownership
         that is the fruit of labor comprises a natural right that is as sacred as
         the right to work and to stay alive.


                                     476

                  The Law of Justice, Love and Charity


883.   Is the desire to possess natural?
       “Yes, but when humans desire to possess only for themselves
       and for their own personal satisfaction it is selfishness.”
       – Nevertheless, isn’t the desire to possess legitimate since the
       one who has enough to live on is not a burden to others?
       “There are insatiable individuals who accumulate possessions
       without benefit to anyone else, or merely to satisfy their
       passions. Do you believe that this is approved by God?
       Those who accumulate assets through their labor with the
       intention of helping their neighbor practice the law of love
       and of charity, and their labor is blessed by God.”
884.   What is the characteristic of legitimate ownership?
       “There is only one legitimate ownership: owning something
       that has been acquired without harm to others.” (See no. 808)
         The law of love and justice forbids us to do to others what we would
         not want them to do to us, and by this same principle it condemns
         every means of acquiring property that is contrary to it.

885.   Is the right of ownership unlimited?
       “Of course, everything that is legitimately acquired represents
       proper ownership; but as we have said, human legislation is
       imperfect and it frequently sanctions conventional rights
       that natural justice does not approve of. That is why humans
       reform their laws as they make progress and as they better
       comprehend justice. What appears perfect in one century
       appears barbaric in the next.” (See no. 795)


       Charity and Love for Our Neighbor
886.   What is the true meaning of the word charity as Jesus
       understood it?

                                   477

                        Part Three – Chapter XI


       “Benevolence toward everyone, indulgence toward the
       imperfections of others and forgiveness for offenses.”
        Love and charity supplement the law of justice because loving our
        neighbors is to do them all the good possible, all that we would wish
        to be done to ourselves. Such is the meaning of Jesus’ words: “Love
        one another as brothers.”
        Charity, according to Jesus, is not restricted to alms-giving, but
        embraces all our relations with our fellow humans, whether in
        situations below, equal or superior to our own. It orders us to be
        indulgent because we need indulgence ourselves, and it forbids us to
        humiliate the unfortunate, contrary to what is commonly practiced.
        Whenever wealthy persons seek us out, we regard them with an
        overabundance of consideration and attention, but whenever poor
        persons seek us out, it seems like we do not want to be troubled by
        them. However, the more pitiable the situation of the latter, the more
        we should refrain from increasing their disgrace through humiliation.
        Those who are truly charitable seek to uplift the self-esteem of those
        in lower positions, thereby diminishing the distance between both.

887.   Jesus also taught: “Love even your enemies.” But isn’t loving
       our enemies contrary to our natural tendencies, and doesn’t
       enmity proceed from a lack of sympathy between spirits?
       “It is obviously not possible to show tender and passionate
       love toward one’s enemies, and that is not what Jesus
       wanted to say. Loving one’s enemies means to forgive
       them and to return good for their evil. That is how we put
       ourselves above them; by seeking vengeance, we only place
       ourselves beneath them.”
888.   What is to be thought of alms-giving?
       “Those who are reduced to begging for alms morally and
       physically degrade themselves in an existence that puts
       them on the level of the brute. A society based on the law
       of God and justice should provide for the life of the weak
       without humiliating them. It should ensure an existence

                                  478

         The Law of Justice, Love and Charity


for those who cannot work, without leaving them at the
mercy of chance and goodwill.”
– Then do you condemn alms-giving?
“No, because it is not the alms-giving per se that is
reprehensible, but almost always the way in which it is
done. Moral individuals, those who understand charity
according to Jesus, seek out the unfortunate without
waiting for them to hold out their hand.
“True charity is always good and benevolent; it is
demonstrated both in the act itself and in the way it is
done. A service rendered with graciousness thus has a
double value; but if it is rendered with haughtiness, the
recipient’s need compels him or her to accept it but his or
her heart will hardly be touched.
“Also, remember that in God’s sight ostentation erases the
merit of benevolence. Jesus said: ‘Do not let your left hand
know what your right hand is doing.’ Therein, he teaches
you not to tarnish charity with pride.
“It is necessary to distinguish between alms-giving per se
and benevolence. The one who is most needy is not always
the one who begs; the fear of humiliation restrains the truly
poor, who almost always suffer without complaining. It is
these whom the authentically humane person knows how
to help without being ostentatious.
“Love one another – that is the whole law, the divine law
through which God governs the worlds. Love is the law of
attraction for living and organized beings, and attraction
is the law of love for inorganic matter.
“Never forget that a spirit, whatever its degree of
advancement or its situation as an incarnate individual or as

                         479

                      Part Three – Chapter XI


       a discarnate spirit, is always placed between a more evolved
       spirit who guides and perfects it, and a less evolved one
       toward whom it has the same duties to fulfill. Therefore,
       be charitable not only by taking from your bag a coin that
       you callously give to the one who dares to beg from you,
       but by seeking out hidden poverty. Be indulgent toward the
       errors of your neighbor. Instead of despising the ignorant
       and the addict, educate and moralize them. Be gentle and
       benevolent toward all those who are less evolved than you.
       Be the same toward the lowermost beings of creation, and
       you will have obeyed the law of God.”
                                     SAINT VINCENT DE PAUL

889.   Aren’t there those who are reduced to begging through their
       own fault?
       “Of course. But if a good moral education had taught them
       the law of God, they would not have fallen into the excesses
       that led them into ruin. It is upon this, above all, that the
       improvement of your globe depends.” (See no. 707)


              Maternal and Filial Love
890.   Is maternal love a virtue or is it an instinctive sentiment
       common to both humans and animals?
       “It is both. Nature has endowed the mother with love
       towards her children in the interests of their preservation,
       but in the animal, this love is limited to the offsprings’
       material needs and ceases when it is no longer needed. In
       humans, this love persists throughout life and consists in
       a devotedness and a self-denial that comprise true virtues.
       It even survives death itself, accompanying the child from


                               480

                 The Law of Justice, Love and Charity


       beyond the grave. You can see that this sort of love contains
       something more than the love displayed in the animal.”
       (See nos. 205-385)
891.   If maternal love is so natural, why are there mothers who hate
       their children – frequently from birth?
       “It is sometimes a trial chosen by the spirit of the child,
       or it may be an expiation if the spirit itself had been a bad
       father, a bad mother or a bad child in another existence
       (see no. 392). In all such cases, a bad mother can only
       be animated by a little-evolved spirit who seeks to create
       difficulties for the child so that he or she will fail in his or
       her chosen trial. Such a violation of the laws of nature,
       however, will not remain unpunished, and the spirit of the
       child will be rewarded for the obstacles it has overcome.”
892.   When parents have children who cause them grief, aren’t they
       excused for not feeling the tenderness for them that they would
       have felt otherwise?
       “No, for it is regarded as a task that has been entrusted
       to them, and their mission is to make every effort to lead
       them to the good (see nos. 582, 583). Besides, such grief
       is almost always the consequence of the bad habits that
       the parents have allowed their children to follow from the
       cradle; thus, they reap what they have sown.”

                     Virtues and Vices
893.    Which is the most meritorious of all the virtues?
        “All virtues are meritorious because all are signs of progress
        on the path of the good. There is always virtue when there
        is voluntary resistance to the allure of evil tendencies.
        However, the highest virtue consists in the sacrifice of
        one’s own interests for the good of one’s neighbor without
        ulterior motives. The greatest merit is that which is based
        on the most disinterested charity.”
894.    There are persons who do good through a spontaneous impulse
        without having to struggle with any contrary sentiment. Do
        they deserve the same merit as those who have to struggle
        against their own nature, and who manage to overcome it?
        “Those who do not have to struggle have already made
        progress. They struggled and triumphed in the past. That is
        why good sentiments cost them no effort and their actions
        seem so easy – doing good has become a habit for them. They
        should be honored as old warriors who have earned their ranks.

       “Since you are still far from perfection, such examples
       surprise you by their contrast and you admire them so
       much because they are rare. However, you must know
       that on worlds more advanced than yours, what is the
       exception among you has become the rule. The sentiment
       of the good is spontaneous everywhere on those worlds
       because they are inhabited only by good spirits, and a
       single bad intention would be a monstrous exception. That
       is why humans are so happy there. The same will occur on
       the earth when humanity transforms itself, and when it
       understands and practices charity in its true meaning.”
895.   Besides the defects and vices about which no one can be
       mistaken, what is the most characteristic sign of imperfection?
       “Self-centeredness. Moral qualities many times do not stand up
       when put to the test, like copper gilding that cannot withstand
       the test of the touchstone. Individuals may possess real qualities
       that make them appear moral to the world. However, while
       such qualities do indicate progress, they do not always bear up
       under certain trials, and sometimes it takes only one touch of
       self-centeredness to unmask these individuals’ real character.
       True selflessness is in fact so rare on earth that it is admired as a
       remarkable phenomenon when it displays itself.
       “Attachment to material things is a notorious indication
       of impurity because the more humans are attached to the
       things of this world, the less they understand their true
       destiny. Through selflessness, however, they show that
       they see the future from a more evolved point of view.”
896.   There are selfless individuals who nonetheless lack discernment,
       and who waste their possessions without real benefit because they
       do not know how to use them reasonably. Will they have any merit?
       “They have merit for their selflessness but not for the
       potential good they could do. If selflessness is a virtue,


                                  484

                           Moral Perfection


       thoughtless squandering is always, at the very least, a lack
       of judgment. Fortune is not given to some to be cast to the
       wind any more than it is given to others to be locked up
       in a safe. It is a deposit for which they will have to render
       account. They will have to answer for all the good they
       could have done but did not do, and for all the tears they
       could have dried with the money they gave away to those
       who were not actually needy.”
897.   Are those blameworthy who do good without seeking a reward
       on earth, but in the hope that it may be taken into account in
       the next life so that their situation there may be better? And
       does such a thought harm their advancement?
       “One must do good out of charity, that is, selflessly.”
       – Nevertheless, all have the very natural desire to progress in
       order to emerge from the painful situation of this life. The
       Spirits teach us to do good with that purpose in mind. So
       would it be wrong to think that through practicing the good
       we may hope for a better situation?
       “Certainly not; however, those who do good without
       ulterior motives, who do it for the sole pleasure of being
       pleasing to God and their suffering neighbor, have already
       found a certain degree of advancement, which will enable
       them to attain happiness more quickly than those who
       do good through calculation and not through the natural
       impulse of their heart.” (See no. 894)
       – Shouldn’t we make a distinction here between the good that
       can be done for our neighbor and the care we devote to correcting
       our own defects? We know that doing good with the thought
       that it will be counted to us in the next life has little merit,
       but would it also be a sign of impurity if we were to amend
       ourselves, conquer our passions and correct our character with


                                 485

                      Part Three – Chapter XII


       the aim of bringing ourselves nearer to the good spirits and of
       receiving a higher position in the spirit world?
       “No, no; by ‘doing good’ we merely mean being charitable.
       Those who calculate what each one of their good actions
       can render them in the other life or in the earthly life
       proceed selfishly. But there is no selfishness in improving
       oneself in the hope of drawing nearer to God because that
       is the objective for all.”
898.   Since the corporeal life is only an ephemeral sojourn on this
       world and since our future life should be our principal concern,
       is it worthwhile to put forth the effort to acquire scientific
       knowledge that only bears upon material things and necessities?
       “Absolutely. First, it enables you to help your brothers and
       sisters. Next, your spirit will evolve more quickly if it has
       progressed intellectually. In the hiatus between incarnations
       you will learn in one hour what would require years on
       earth. No knowledge is useless; it all contributes in some
       degree to advancement because the perfected spirit must
       know everything. Since progress must be made in every
       sense, all acquired ideas help the development of the spirit.”
899.   Of two wealthy individuals, one was born in opulence and has
       never known need, whereas the other owes his fortune to his
       own labor. However, both employ their wealth exclusively for
       their own personal satisfaction. Which one is the more culpable?
       “The one who has known hardship. He knows what it
       means to suffer but does not relieve it in others; as usually
       happens, he no longer remembers his hardship.”
900.   Do those who continue to accumulate assets without benefiting
       anyone have a valid excuse in saying that they are doing so in
       order to leave the assets to their heirs?
       “It attests to their bad principles.”

                                486

                           Moral Perfection


901.   Of two misers, the first deprives himself of necessities and dies
       of want atop his treasure, whereas the second is only stingy
       toward others but is extravagant toward himself. While he
       recoils before the smallest sacrifice to render a service or do
       something useful, nothing seems better to him than satisfying
       his own tastes and passions. If a favor is asked of him, he is
       always ill-willed, but if a whim strikes, he is always ready to
       satisfy it. Which of them is guiltier and which of them will
       have the worse place in the spirit world?
       “The one who spends. He is more selfish than the miser.
       The miser has already received part of his punishment.”
902.   Is it wrong to desire wealth with the desire to do good?
       “Such a sentiment is of course laudable if it is pure. But is
       such a desire always disinterested enough? Doesn’t it hide
       a personal ulterior motive? Isn’t the first person to whom
       we wish to do good many times our own self?”
903.   Is it wrong to study others’ defects?
       “If it is for the purpose of criticizing and divulging them
       it is wrong because it displays a lack of charity. If it is with
       the intention of applying it to oneself in order to avoid the
       same defects it may be useful. You must not forget, however,
       that tolerance for the defects of others is one of the virtues
       entailed in charity. Before criticizing people’s imperfections,
       think about whether others may say the same about you. So
       try to possess qualities that are opposite to the defects you
       criticize in others. This is a means of perfecting yourself.
       If you criticize them for being avaricious, be generous; for
       being harsh, be nice; for acting with pettiness, be expansive
       in all your actions. In a word, act in such a way that these
       words of Jesus may not apply to you: ‘You see the speck in
       your neighbor’s eye, but do not see the beam in your own.’”


                                 487

                        Part Three – Chapter XII


904.   Is it wrong for a person to probe the ills of society and expose them?
       “That depends on the sentiment leading the person to do so.
       If a writer only wants to create a scandal, he or she does so out
       of personal pleasure, publishing material that generally sets a
       bad example rather than a good one. The spirit enjoys it, but
       it can be punished for the pleasure it feels in revealing evil.”
       – In such cases, how can we judge a writer’s purity of intention
       and sincerity?
       “There is no need to do so. If the message is good, benefit
       from it; if it is bad, it becomes a problem for the writer’s
       own conscience. Moreover, if writers desire to prove their
       sincerity, it falls to them to support their principles by
       setting their own example.”
905.   Some authors have published works that are beautiful and morally
       uplifting, which help the progress of humankind, but which they
       themselves do not take advantage of. As spirits, will the good they
       have done through their works be taken into account?
       “Morality without action is like the seed without the sowing.
       What use is the seed if you do not make it grow in order to
       feed you? Those persons are guiltier because they possessed
       the intelligence to comprehend. Having not practiced the
       maxims they offered to others, they fail to harvest the fruit.”
906.   Is it reprehensible for those who do good to be conscious of
       their deeds and to acknowledge them to themselves?
       “Since they can be aware of the evil they do, they must be
       equally aware of the good in order to know if they act rightly
       or wrongly. It is in weighing all their actions on the scales of
       God’s law – especially on those of the law of justice, love, and
       charity – that they can tell whether their actions are good or
       bad, and thus approve or disapprove of them. Hence, they
       cannot be at fault for recognizing the fact that they have

                                   488

                             Moral Perfection


       triumphed over their evil tendencies, and for being satisfied
       for having done so, provided they do not grow vain, for that
       would be to fall into another wrong.” (See no. 919)


                         The Passions
907.   Since the principle of our passions originates in nature, are
       they evil per se?
       “No. Passion is the result of excess brought about by the
       will, though the principle itself was given to humans for
       their good. The passions can lead them to do great things.
       Their abuse of them is what makes them evil.”
908.   How may we define the limit at which the passions cease to be
       good or bad?
       “The passions are like a horse that is useful when controlled but
       dangerous when it controls. You can recognize when a passion
       becomes harmful at the moment in which you cease to govern
       it, and when it results in any injury to yourselves or others.”
         The passions are levers that increase humans’ powers tenfold and
         help them to fulfill the designs of Providence. However, if instead
         of directing their passions they allow themselves to be directed by
         them, they fall into excess, and the very power which in their hands
         could have done good falls upon them and crushes them instead.
         All the passions have their principle in a sentiment or need of
         nature. Therefore, the principle of the passions is not evil, because
         it rests upon one of the providential conditions of our existence.
         Passion per se is the exaggeration of a need or sentiment – it is in
         the excess and not in the cause – and such excess becomes evil when
         it results in some kind of evil.
         Every passion that brings us nearer to the animal nature takes us
         further from the spiritual nature. Every sentiment that lifts us above



                                   489

                       Part Three – Chapter XII


         the animal nature announces the predominance of spirit over matter
         and draws us closer to perfection.

909.   Could humans always overcome their evil tendencies through
       their own efforts?
       “Yes, and sometimes with very little effort; what they lack is
       will power. How few of you make such an effort, however!”
910.   Can humans find in spirits an effective aid to help them
       overcome their passions?
       “If you sincerely pray to God and your guardian angel,
       good spirits will certainly come to your aid – that is their
       mission.” (See no. 459)
911.   Aren’t there passions that are so alive and irresistible that the
       will is powerless to overcome them?
       “There are many who say ‘I want to’, but their will is only
       on their lips. They want, but they are very satisfied at not
       being able to. When they believe they cannot overcome
       their passions, it is because their spirit is pleased by them
       as a result of its own impurity. Those who try to restrain
       their passions understand their own spiritual nature, and
       overcoming them is a triumph of the spirit over matter.”
912.   What is the most effective means of fighting the predominance
       of the corporeal nature?
       “Practicing self-denial.”


                           Selfishness
913.   Of all the vices, which may we regard as the root?
       “We have already told you many times: selfishness. All evil
       derives from it. Study all the vices and you will see that


                                  490

                            Moral Perfection


       selfishness is at the bottom of them all. As much as you may
       struggle against them, you will never uproot them as long
       as you have not destroyed their cause. Let all your efforts
       tend toward that end, because selfishness is the true scourge
       of society. Those in this life who want to approach moral
       perfection must uproot from their heart every sentiment of
       selfishness, for selfishness is incompatible with justice, love
       and charity; it neutralizes all other qualities.”
914.   Since selfishness is based on personal interests, it seems difficult
       to entirely uproot it from the human heart. Will we ever be
       able to do so?
       “As humans become enlightened about spiritual things,
       they attach less value to material things. Next, it is
       necessary to reform the human institutions that entertain
       and excite the passions. This depends on education.”
915.   Since selfishness is inherent to the human species, won’t
       it always be a permanent obstacle to the reign of absolute
       goodness upon the earth?
       “It is certain that selfishness is your greatest evil, but it is
       connected to the unpurified nature of the spirits incarnated
       on the earth, and not to the human species per se. Upon
       purifying themselves over successive incarnations, spirits
       get rid of selfishness just as they get rid of other impurities.
       On the earth, aren’t there persons who are divested of
       selfishness, and who practice charity? They exist in greater
       numbers than you might think, but you know few of
       them because virtue does not seek to reveal itself in broad
       daylight. If there is one, why wouldn’t there be ten? If there
       are ten, why wouldn’t there be a thousand, and so on?”
916.   Far from decreasing, selfishness increases with civilization,
       which seems to excite and entertain it. How can the cause
       destroy the effect?


                                  491

                      Part Three – Chapter XII


       “The greater the evil, the more heinous it becomes. It has
       been necessary for selfishness to produce much evil in order
       to make you understand the need to uproot it. When human
       beings have been freed from the selfishness that dominates
       them, they will live as brothers and sisters. They will not
       do evil to one another and will mutually help one another
       through the fraternal sentiment of solidarity. The strong will
       then be the support and not the oppressor of the weak, and
       no longer will anyone lack what is needed because all will
       practice the law of justice. This is the kingdom of the good
       that the Spirits are in charge of preparing.” (See no. 784)
917.   What is the means for destroying selfishness?
       “Of all human imperfections, the most difficult to uproot is
       selfishness because it is connected to the influence of matter,
       from which human beings, still so close to their origin, cannot
       free themselves. Everything concurs to sustain its influence:
       your laws, your social organizations and your education.
       Selfishness will be weakened with the predominance of
       the moral life over the material life, and especially with the
       understanding that Spiritism gives you concerning your
       true future state, which is no longer distorted by allegorical
       fictions. When it is well understood and identified with
       customs and beliefs, Spiritism will transform habits,
       usages and social relations. Selfishness is founded upon
       the importance of the personality. When well understood,
       I repeat, Spiritism enables you to see things from such an
       evolved point of view that the sentiment of the personality
       somehow disappears before the Doctrine’s immensity. Upon
       destroying this self-importance and showing its real nature,
       Spiritism necessarily combats selfishness.
       “It is the shock that humans experience from the
       selfishness of others that usually makes them selfish in


                                492

                   Moral Perfection


turn because they feel the need to put themselves on the
defensive. Seeing that others think only of themselves and
not of them, they are in turn led to be concerned about
themselves more than about others. Let the principle of
charity and fraternity be the basis of social institutions and
the legal relations between nations and individuals, and
all will think less of themselves when they see that others
are doing so too; thus, they will undergo the moralizing
influence of example and contact. In the light of the
present overflowing of selfishness, true virtue is needed to
sacrifice one’s own personality for the sake of others, who
generally do not recognize it. It is to those, above all, who
possess this virtue that the Kingdom of Heaven is opened.
For them, especially, is reserved the bliss of the elect,
because I can truly tell you that on the day of judgment,
those who have only thought of themselves will be cast
aside and will suffer abandonment.” (See no. 785)
                                                         Fenelon

 Laudable efforts have doubtlessly been made to help humankind
 advance. Good sentiments are encouraged, stimulated and
 honored today more than at any other time, and yet the
 devouring worm of selfishness continues to be the scourge of
 society. It is a true evil that is scattered throughout the world
 and of which everyone is more or less a victim. Therefore, it is
 necessary to fight it as if we were fighting an epidemic. To this
 end we must proceed as physicians do: go back to the cause. Let
 us seek out in every structure of the social organization – from
 the family to nations, from the hovel to the palace – all the
 causes, all the patent or hidden influences that excite, maintain
 and develop the sentiment of selfishness. Once the causes are
 known, the remedy will present itself. We will only need to
 fight them, if not completely, then at least partly, and little by
 little the poison will be drawn out. The cure may take a long



                          493

              Part Three – Chapter XII


time because the causes are numerous, but it is not impossible.
Moreover, we cannot reach that point unless we attack the evil
at its roots; that is, through education. Not the education that
aims only to educate people, however; rather, the education that
also aims to make them moral individuals. When it is rightly
understood, education will be the key to moral progress. When
the art of managing characters is understood as well as the art of
managing intelligences, we will be able to correct characters in
the same way that we straighten new plants. However, this art
requires much tact, much experience and profound observation.
It is a serious error to believe that it is enough to simply have
knowledge in order to apply it advantageously. Whoever has
observed the children of the wealthy as well as of the poor from
the moment of their birth, noticing all the harmful influences
that act on them as a result of the weakness, ignorance and
negligence of those who guide them, and also noticing how
often the means employed to moralize them usually fail, will not
be surprised to find so much confusion in the world. Let efforts
be made toward morality as much as toward intelligence and
we will see that if there are obstinate natures, there are also, in
a greater number than you might think, those who require only
good cultivation in order to yield good fruit. (See no. 872)
People want to be content, and this sentiment is in their very
nature. That is why they work without ceasing to improve
their situation on earth, and to seek out the causes of their
ills in order to cure them. When they rightly understand that
selfishness is one of those causes; that it engenders the pride,
ambition, cupidity, envy, hatred and jealousy of which they
are at every moment the victim; that it brings trouble into
all social relations, provokes dissension and destroys trust,
obligating them to constantly maintain a defensive attitude
towards their neighbor; that it engenders a sentiment that
converts friend into foe, then they will also understand that
this vice is incompatible with their own happiness. We would
add that it is incompatible with their own safety as well. Thus,
the more they suffer as a result of it, the more they will feel the
need to fight it as they would a plague, harmful animals and


                         494

                              Moral Perfection


          all other scourges. They will be compelled to do so out of their
          own self-interest. (See no. 784)
          Selfishness is the source of all vices, as charity is the source of all
          virtues. Destroying the former and developing the latter should be
          the aim of all people’s efforts if they wish to ensure their happiness
          in this world as well as in the future.



       The Characteristics of a Moral Person
918.    By what signs can we recognize in individuals the real progress
        that will raise their spirit within the spirit hierarchy?
        “The spirit proves its progress when all the actions of its
        corporeal life consist in practicing the law of God, and
        when it understands the spirit life beforehand.”
          Truly moral individuals are those who practice the law of justice,
          love and charity in its most complete purity. If they interrogate their
          conscience concerning their actions, they will ask if they have not
          violated that law, if they have not committed any evil, if they have
          done all the good that is within their power to do, if no one has a
          complaint against them, and lastly, if they have done to others what
          they would want others to do unto them.
          Those possessing the sentiment of charity and love for their neighbor
          do good for its own sake, without hope of reward, and they sacrifice
          their self-interest for justice’s sake.
          They are good, humane and benevolent toward all because they
          see their own brothers and sisters in all humans regardless of race
          or belief.
          If God has given them power and wealth, they regard it as A
          DEPOSIT that they must use for the good, but this does not make
          them vain, because they know that God, who has given them power
          and wealth, can also take them away.
          If the social order has placed persons under their care, they treat
          them with kindness and benevolence because they are equals before


                                     495

               God. They use their authority to build them up morally, and not to
               crush them with their pride.
               They are tolerant of the weaknesses of others, for they know that
               they themselves need tolerance, and they remember the words of
               Christ, “Let him that is without sin cast the first stone.”
               They are not vindictive: following Jesus’ example, they forgive
               offenses and only remember benefits because they know that they
               will be forgiven as they have forgiven.
               Finally, they respect in others all the rights that the laws of nature
               have granted them, as they would desire their own to be respected.



                             Self-Knowledge
919.        What is the most effective means for improving ourselves in
            this life and for resisting the draw of evil?
            “A sage of antiquity has told you: ‘Know thyself.’”59
            – We comprehend all the wisdom of that maxim, but the difficulty
            is precisely in knowing ourselves. By what means can we do so?
            “Do what I used to do when I was living on the earth. At the
            end of each day I examined my conscience, reviewed what
            I had done and asked myself whether or not I had failed to
            fulfill some duty and whether or not anyone might have
            had reason to complain about me. It was thus that I arrived
            at knowing myself and at seeing what there was in me that
            needed to be reformed. Those who every night would recall
            all their actions during the day, and would ask themselves
            what good or evil they have done, praying to God and
            their guardian angel to enlighten them, would acquire great
            strength for self-improvement, because, believe me, God
            will assist them. Therefore, ask yourselves about what you
 		Socrates. – Tr.

have done and toward what aim you acted in a particular
circumstance, whether you have done anything that you
would blame in others, and whether you have done anything
that you would not dare profess. Also ask: if it pleased God
to call me at this moment to enter the world of spirits, where
nothing is hidden, would I cower before anyone’s gaze?
Examine what you may have done against God, then against
your neighbor, and lastly, against yourselves. The answers will
be either repose for your conscience, or an indication of a
wrong that you must amend.
“Self-knowledge is therefore the key to individual
improvement. But, you will ask, how do we judge
ourselves? Won’t we be under the illusion of vanity, which
exalts our wrongs and makes them excusable? Misers think
they are simply being thrifty and foresightful, while proud
individuals think they are only full of dignity. All of this
is quite true, but you have a means of control that cannot
deceive you. When you are indecisive as to the quality of
any one of your actions, ask how you would judge it if it
had been done by someone else. If you would blame it
in another, it cannot be any more legitimate for you, for
God does not use two measures for justice. Also, seek to
know what others think about you and do not neglect the
opinion of your enemies, because they have no interest in
disguising the truth. Frequently, God places them beside
you as a mirror in order to warn you more frankly than a
friend would. Therefore, let those who are truly willing
to improve themselves examine their own conscience in
order to uproot from it their evil tendencies as they uproot
weeds from their garden. Let them balance out their moral
workday like business persons do with their profits and
losses, and I can assure you that there will be more profits
than losses. If you can say that your workday has been

                         497

               Part Three – Chapter XII


good, you can sleep in peace and fearlessly wait for your
awaking in the other life.
“So formulate clear and precise questions and do not be
afraid to add to them; you would do very well to devote a
few minutes to securing eternal bliss. Don’t you work every
day to accumulate what you will need for rest in old age?
Isn’t this rest the object of all your desires, the goal that
enables you to endure temporary fatigue and deprivation?
Well then, what is the rest of a few days, troubled by the
infirmities of the body, compared to what awaits the moral
person? Isn’t it worth a little effort? I know that many will
say that the present is certain but the future is uncertain.
That is precisely the thought that we have been charged
with tearing down in your minds, for we desire to enable
you to understand that future in such a way that no doubt
can remain in your soul. This is why we first called your
attention to us through the phenomena of nature, by
touching your senses, and why later we gave you instructions
that each one of you has the duty to spread. It was with this
purpose in mind that we have dictated The Spirits’ Book.”
                                            ST. AUGUSTINE

 Many of the wrongs we commit pass by us unnoticed. In fact,
 following the counsel of St. Augustine, if we would interrogate
 our conscience more frequently, we would see how often we have
 failed without noticing it by not having scrutinized the nature
 and motive for our deeds. This interrogation method is somewhat
 more precise than using a maxim, which we do not usually apply
 to ourselves. It requires categorical yes-no answers that leave no
 room for alternatives. They are personal assertions and from the
 sum of the answers, we can compute the sum of the good and the
 evil that exists in us.

       Relative Happiness and Unhappiness
920.    Can people enjoy complete happiness while on earth?
        “No, because life has been given to them as either a trial or
        an expiation; it is up to them to mitigate their misfortunes
        and be as happy as possible while on earth.”
921.    We can understand that people will be happy on the earth when
        humanity as a whole is finally transformed, but meanwhile, is
        it possible for anyone to enjoy relative happiness?
        “Most of the time, people are the artisans of their own
        unhappiness. If they would practice the law of God, they
        would spare themselves many misfortunes and enjoy a
        state of happiness that is as great as their existence on such
        a dense plane will allow.”
         Those who have a sufficient understanding of their future destiny
         do not see their corporeal existence as anything more than a quick


                                  501

         journey. It is like a momentary stopover at a dreadful inn. They
         easily console themselves regarding a few passing annoyances on a
         journey that will lead them to a better situation to the degree they
         have prepared themselves for it.
         We are punished in this life through the infractions we commit against
         the laws of corporeal existence, through the misfortunes resulting
         from such infractions and through our own excesses. If we were to
         trace what we call our earthly misfortunes back to their origin, we
         would see that most of them are the result of an early deviation from
         the straight and true road, thereby entering onto the wrong path; and
         from one thing to the next, we finally fell into disgrace.

922.   Earthly happiness is relative to the position of each person,
       and what might suffice for the happiness of one would be
       misfortune for another. Is there nevertheless a common
       standard of happiness for all?
       “For material existence, it is the possession of all that is
       necessary; for the moral life, it is a good conscience and
       faith in the future.”
923.   Doesn’t that which would be superfluous for one become a
       necessity for another, and vice versa, according to their social
       position?
       “Yes, according to your materialistic ideas, your prejudices,
       your ambition, and all your absurd notions, for which the
       future will demand justice when you finally comprehend
       the truth. Obviously, those who have had an income
       of 50,000, who then see it reduced to 10,000, would
       consider themselves most unfortunate because they cannot
       maintain the demands of their social status: keeping good
       horses and servants, gratifying all their passions, etc. They
       would regard themselves as lacking the necessities. Frankly,
       however, shouldn’t you consider them worthy of pity while
       beside them are others who are dying of cold and hunger,


                                   502

                       Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       without a place to lay their head? To be happy, the wise
       look down, never up; when they do lift their gaze, it is to
       raise their own soul toward the infinite.” (See no. 715)
924.   There are misfortunes which do not depend on the way we act
       and which harm the most righteous people. Isn’t there a way
       to keep ourselves from such misfortunes?
       “If you want to progress, you must resign yourselves and
       endure misfortunes without complaining. However, you
       will always find consolation within your own conscience,
       which gives you the hope of a better future, provided you
       do what is needed to obtain it.”
925.   Why does God bless with the goods of wealth certain
       individuals who do not seem to deserve them?
       “It looks like a favor to those who do not see beyond the
       present; but you yourselves know that wealth is a trial that
       is usually more dangerous than poverty.” (See nos. 814 ff.)
926.   Because it creates new necessities, isn’t civilization the source
       of new afflictions?
       “The misfortunes of this world result from the artificial
       needs you create for yourselves. People who know how
       to limit their desires, seeing without greed whatever
       might lie beyond their means, spare themselves many
       disappointments in this life. The wealthiest are really those
       who have the fewest needs.
       “You envy the pleasures of the people who appear to be the
       fortunate ones of this earth. But do you happen to know
       what is in store for them? If they use their wealth only
       for themselves, they are selfish and will suffer a reversal.
       Pity them instead. God sometimes allows the wicked to
       prosper; but their prosperity is not to be envied, because


                                 503

                        Part Four – Chapter I


       they will pay for it with bitter tears. If the righteous are
       unfortunate, it is because they are going through a trial
       that will be credited to them if they bear it with courage.
       Remember the words of Jesus: ‘Blessed are those who
       suffer, for they shall be comforted.’”
927.   Superfluity is certainly not indispensable to happiness, but the
       same does not apply to necessities. So isn’t the misfortune of
       those who are deprived of them real?
       “They are truly unfortunate only when they lack what is
       necessary for their life and the health of their body. Such
       deprivation is perhaps the result of their own making, and
       they can only blame themselves for it. If it has resulted
       from the wrong of another, the responsibility would fall
       upon the one who has caused it.”
928.   Through the special nature of our natural aptitudes, God
       obviously shows to each one of us our vocation in this world.
       Don’t many misfortunes come from the fact that we are not
       following the right vocation?
       “That is true, and many times parents are the ones who,
       through pride or avarice, make their children deviate
       from the path outlined for them by nature, thereby
       compromising their happiness. They will be held
       responsible for having done so.”
       – So would you consider it right if the son of a man of the
       upper classes became a cobbler, for instance, if that was his
       aptitude?
       “You do not need to resort to absurdities and exaggerations.
       Civilization has its necessities. Why would the son of an
       upper class man become a cobbler if he can do other
       things? Individuals can always be useful according to their
       abilities if they are not applied to something they are not


                                504

                         Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       meant for. For instance, instead of a bad lawyer, they could
       perhaps become a skilled mechanic, etc.”
         Operating outside their proper intellectual sphere is assuredly one of
         the most frequent causes of disappointment. Ineptitude in a chosen
         career is an inexhaustible source of reversals. Then, pride is added to
         the mix, which keeps individuals from resorting to a more humble
         profession, and they often regard suicide as the ultimate remedy
         for escaping from what they consider as humiliation. If a moral
         education had raised them above all of the prejudices of pride, they
         would never become destitute.

929.   There are people who are destitute of all resources even when
       there is abundance all around them, and who do not see any
       other solution to their problem except death. What should
       they do? Should they allow themselves to die of hunger?
       “People should never contemplate the idea of allowing
       themselves to die of hunger. They can always find the
       means to feed themselves if pride does not interpose itself
       between need and work. We frequently say that there are
       no dishonorable professions, and that it is not the job per
       se that is dishonorable – words we unfortunately apply
       more to others than to ourselves.”
930.   It seems obvious that without the social prejudices that we
       allow to dominate us, we would always be able to find some
       sort of work that would enable us to make a living, even
       though in a lower position. Among those who have no such
       prejudices, however, or who put them aside, aren’t there those
       who are unable to provide for their needs as a result of illness
       or other causes independent of their will?
       “In a society organized according to the law of Christ, no
       one should die of hunger.”
         With a wise and provident societal organization, people would never
         lack what is necessary except by their own fault, which is often the


                                    505

                           Part Four – Chapter I


         result of their environment. When they practice the law of God,
         however, there will be a social order founded on justice and solidarity,
         and they themselves will be better individuals. (See no. 793)

931.   Why are the suffering social classes more numerous than the
       fortunate ones?
       “No one is perfectly happy. Those who are looked at as
       fortunate often hide poignant afflictions. Suffering is
       everywhere. However, in response to your thought I will say
       that what you call the suffering classes are more numerous
       because the earth is a place of expiation. When humans
       have finally transformed it into the habitat of the good and
       of good spirits, men and women will no longer be unhappy
       in this world. It will be a terrestrial paradise for them.”
932.   Why do the wicked of this world usually exert a great influence
       over the good?
       “Because the good are not assertive. The wicked are
       scheming and daring, whereas the good are timid. The
       moment they want to, the latter will prevail.”
933.   If people are usually the artisans of their material sufferings,
       are they also the artisans of their mental sufferings?
       “Even more so, because their material sufferings are
       sometimes independent of their will, while wounding
       pride, frustrating ambition, avaricious anxieties, envy,
       jealousy – in short, all the passions – comprise the torments
       of the soul.
       “Envy and jealousy! Happy are they who do not know
       those two voracious worms! Wherever envy and jealousy
       exist, there can be no calm, no repose. For those who
       suffer from these maladies, the objects of their longings,
       their hatred and their spite appear before them like ghosts
       which do not leave them in peace and which pursue them

                                    506

                 Earthly Joys and Sorrows


even in their sleep. Envious and jealous individuals live
in a continual feverish state. Is that a desirable situation?
Can’t you understand that with such passions people
create intentional punishments for themselves, and that
the earth becomes a true hell for them?”
 Many expressions symbolically represent the effects of different
 passions. We say: puffed up with pride, dying of envy, bursting
 with jealousy or spite, etc. Such pictures state the truth very
 well. Sometimes jealousy does not have a specific object. There
 are persons whose nature makes them jealous of anyone who is
 successful or who has risen above mediocrity, although they have
 no direct interest in the matter; they are jealous solely because they
 cannot reach the same level. Everything that seems to be above the
 common horizon offends them, and if they formed the majority of
 society, they would want everything to be brought down to their
 own level. In such cases jealousy is allied with mediocrity.
 People are usually unhappy because of the importance they attach to
 the things of this world. Vanity, failed ambition and greed make them
 unhappy. If they would raise themselves above the narrow circle of the
 material life, if they would raise their thoughts toward the infinite –
 which is their destiny – the vicissitudes of human existence would
 seem petty and childish, like the sadness of a child who suffers the loss
 of a toy that represented his or her supreme happiness.
 Those who only find happiness by satisfying their pride and crude
 material appetites are unhappy when they cannot satisfy them,
 whereas those who are frugal feel happy with what for others would
 comprise misfortune.
 We are referring here to civilized people, because primitives have
 needs that are much more limited and thus they do not have the same
 reasons for envy and anxiety. Their way of looking at things is much
 different. In the civilized state, people think about and analyze their
 unhappiness, and hence they are more affected by it. On the other
 hand, they can also think about and analyze the means of consolation
 in the Christian sentiment that gives them the hope of a better future, and
 in Spiritism, which gives them the certainty of that future.

               The Loss of Loved Ones
934.   Doesn’t the loss of loved ones cause us suffering and act as a
       legitimate source of sorrow since such loss is both irreparable
       and independent of our will?
       “This cause of sorrow strikes both the rich and the poor.
       It comprises a trial or expiation and a law for all. It is a
       consolation, however, to be able to communicate with
       your friends through the means available to you while
       awaiting other ways that are more direct and accessible to
       your senses.”
935.   What about the opinion of people who regard communication
       with those beyond the grave as a sacrilege?
       “There can be no sacrilege where there is reverence and
       when the evocation is made with respect and propriety. The
       proof of this is that the spirits who have affection for you
       take pleasure in coming to you, and they rejoice in being
       remembered and in being able to converse with you. There
       would only be sacrilege if evocations were made frivolously.”
         The possibility of entering into communication with spirits is a
         very endearing consolation, which gives us the means of conversing
         with the relatives and friends who have left the earth before us. By
         our evocation, they draw near to us, remain at our side, hear us,
         and reply to us. There is, so to speak, no longer any separation
         between them and us. They aid us with their counsels and they
         bear witness to their affection and the contentment they experience
         through our remembrance of them. It is a satisfaction for us to
         know that they are happy and to learn from them personally the
         details of their new existence, acquiring the certainty that some
         day we will rejoin them in our turn.

936.   How does the inconsolable sorrow of those who remain on
       earth affect the spirits who are its object?


                                   508

                  Earthly Joys and Sorrows


“A spirit is sensitive to the memory and grief of those it
has loved, but persistent and unreasonable sorrow affects it
grievously because it sees in such excess a lack of faith in the
future and trust in God, and consequently, an obstacle to
progress and perhaps to their reunion in the spirit world.”
  When a spirit is happier than it was on the earth, to regret that it
  has left this life behind is to regret that it is happy. Two friends are
  prisoners in the same jail; both of them are to be freed someday but
  one of them is freed first. Would it be right on the part of the one
  who remains in prison to be saddened that his friend has been set
  free before him? Would there not be on his part more selfishness
  than affection in wishing that his friend would remain in captivity
  and suffer as long as himself? The same applies to two persons who
  love each other on the earth. The one who departs first is the first
  to be freed, and the other should be happy, patiently waiting for the
  moment when he or she will also be liberated.
  Let us make another comparison. You have a friend who lives
  nearby. She finds herself in a trying situation, and her health or
  personal interests require her to go to another country, where she
  will be better off in every respect. Thus, she will no longer be nearby
  for quite some time; nevertheless, you will be able to continue to
  remain in contact through correspondence – the separation will be
  only physical. Will you grieve her departure since it is for her good?
  The Spiritist Doctrine, through the obvious proofs it gives us
  concerning the future life, the presence around us of beings we have
  loved, the continuing of their affection and kindness, as well as
  the relationships that enable us to communicate with them, offers
  us supreme consolation in the face of one of the most legitimate
  causes of sorrow. With Spiritism there is no more abandonment.
  The most isolated of human beings is always surrounded by friends
  with whom he or she can communicate.
  We impatiently endure the tribulations of life. They seem so
  intolerable that we think we cannot bear them. Nevertheless,
  if we do bear them with courage, if we know how to silence our
  complaining, we will rejoice when we are released from this earthly


                             509

                          Part Four – Chapter I


         prison, in the same way that patients who have been suffering for
         a long time rejoice at being healed after having patiently endured a
         painful treatment.



       Disappointments. Ungratefulness.
              Broken Affections
937.   Aren’t the disappointments caused by ingratitude and by the
       fragility of the ties of friendships also a source of bitterness for
       the human heart?
       “Yes, but we have already taught you to feel pity for
       ungrateful and disloyal friends. They will be unhappier
       than you are. Ingratitude is the child of selfishness and
       selfish individuals will sooner or later encounter hearts as
       hard as their own. Just think of all those who have done
       more good than you, who are more worthy than you, and
       who have been repaid with ingratitude. Remember that
       during his life Jesus himself was scoffed at, despised, and
       treated as a villain and an impostor. So do not be surprised
       when the same happens to you. Let the good you have
       done be your reward in this world and do not worry about
       what those who have benefited from it say. Ingratitude
       serves to test your persistence in doing good. It will be
       credited to you, and those who have been thoughtless
       toward you will be punished to the same extent that they
       have been ungrateful.”
938.   Couldn’t the disappointments caused by ingratitude harden
       the heart and make it insensitive?
       “That would be unfortunate because persons with heart,
       as you say, will always be happy for the good they have
       done. They know that if the good they have done is not


                                   510

                         Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       remembered in the present life, it will be in another, and
       the ingrate will then feel shame and remorse.”
       – But this knowledge will not prevent their heart from feeling
       hurt. Mightn’t this lead them to think they would be happier
       if they were less sensitive?
       “Yes, if they were to prefer a selfish happiness, a very sad
       happiness! However, if they know that the ungrateful friends
       who desert them are unworthy of their friendship, and that
       they have been mistaken about them, they will no longer
       regret losing them. Later on, they will find friends who are
       more understanding. You should pity those who treat you
       in a way that you do not deserve, because they will suffer a
       sad recompense. Don’t let yourselves be afflicted by them: it
       is a means for you to raise yourselves above them.”
         Nature has given humans the need to love and be loved. One of the
         greatest enjoyments granted to them on earth is in their meeting with
         mutually attuned hearts. Nature thus grants them a foretaste of the
         happiness waiting for them in the world of perfected spirits, where
         all is love and benevolence – a happiness that is refused to the selfish.



                   Antipathetic Unions
939.   Since sympathetic spirits are led to meet one another, why is
       it that among incarnate spirits affection is frequently only one­-
       -sided, and sincere love is received with indifference or even
       repulsion? Moreover, can’t the liveliest affection between two
       persons turn into dislike and sometimes hatred?
       “Can’t you understand that this may be a punishment,
       albeit a passing one? Besides, how many are there who
       think they are deeply in love because they only judge
       physical appearance, but when obliged to live together


                                     511

                        Part Four – Chapter I


       they soon realize their judgment had only been based
       on physical passion? It is not enough to be enamored
       with someone who pleases you, and whom you suppose
       to be endowed with beautiful qualities; it is only by
       living together that you can appreciate each other. On
       the other hand, how many unions there are that at first
       seem to be incompatible, but which, in time, as both get
       to know each other better, are transformed into a tender
       and lasting love because it is founded on mutual esteem!
       You must not forget that it is the spirit who loves and not
       the body, and that once the physical illusion dissipates
       the spirit sees reality.
       “There are two kinds of affection: that of the body and
       that of the soul, and these are often mistaken for each
       other. When pure and sympathetic, the affection of the
       soul is lasting; the affection of the body is perishable. That
       is why those who believed they loved each other with an
       eternal love often end up detesting each other when the
       illusion has vanished.”
940.   Isn’t the lack of sympathy between persons destined to live
       together also a source of suffering that is all the more bitter
       because it poisons their entire existence?
       “Very bitter, in fact. However, it is usually one of those
       misfortunes of which you yourselves are the main cause.
       In the first place, simply because your laws are at fault do
       you believe that God obliges you to live with those you
       dislike? Moreover, in such unions you almost always seek
       more to satisfy your pride and ambition rather than to
       enjoy the happiness of mutual affection. Thus, you suffer
       the natural consequence of your prejudices.”
       – But in such cases isn’t there almost always an innocent


                                512

                        Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       victim?
       “Yes, and for that one it is a heavy expiation; however, the
       responsibility for such unhappiness will fall upon the one
       who has caused it. If the light of truth has reached the soul
       of the victim, faith in the future will provide consolation.
       Besides, to the degree that such prejudices are weakened,
       the causes of these private misfortunes will disappear.”


                     The Fear of Death
941.   The worry over death is highly vexing to many people. Why
       such worry if they have the whole future in front of them?
       “It is wrong to have such apprehension, but what do you
       expect? Since early on, people have been persuaded that
       there is a hell and a heaven, and that they will most likely
       go to hell because they have been taught that whatever
       belongs to the realm of nature is a mortal sin for the soul.
       Thus, when they grow up, and if they have any reason at
       all, they can no longer accept such a belief and become
       atheists or materialists. It is thus that they are led to believe
       that nothing exists beyond the present life. As for those
       who persist in their childhood belief, they fear the eternal
       fire that must burn them without destroying them.
       “But death does not inspire any fear in the righteous, for
       faith gives them certainty about the future. Hope beckons
       them with a better life, and since they have practiced the
       law of charity, they have the assurance that in the world
       into which they will enter, they will not find anyone into
       whose eyes they will dread to look .” (See no. 730)
         Carnal individuals are more connected to corporeal life than spiritual
         life, and while on earth they experience only its physical pains and


                                   513

                          Part Four – Chapter I


         pleasures. Their happiness consists in the fleeting satisfaction of all
         their desires. Their soul is constantly concerned with and affected
         by the vicissitudes of life, and hence it remains anxious and in
         constant torment. Death terrifies them because they have doubts
         about the future and because they believe that they must leave on
         earth all their affections and hopes.
         Even while in this world, moral persons, who have raised themselves
         above the artificial needs created by the passions, experience
         pleasures unknown to materialistic persons. The moderation of
         their desires lends calmness and serenity to their spirit. Happy with
         the good they do, there are no disappointments, and vexations pass
         lightly over their soul without leaving any painful marks.

942.   Won’t some people think that these counsels about happiness
       are a little banal? Won’t they see them as being commonplace
       or as platitudes, and won’t they say that the secret to happiness
       is to know how to bear up under misfortune?
       “There are those who say that, and they are numerous.
       Many of them, however, are like ill persons for whom the
       doctor has prescribed a particular diet: they would like to
       be healed without any medications and continue to hand
       themselves over to indigestion.”


        Dissatisfaction with Life. Suicide
943.   Where does the dissatisfaction with life come from, which
       takes hold of some individuals without any plausible reason?
       “It is the effect of idleness, lack of faith, and usually, satiety.
       For those who employ their faculties with a useful purpose
       and according to their natural aptitudes, labor has nothing
       barren about it and life flows by more quickly. They bear
       life’s tribulations with patience and resignation because
       they look forward to the more solid and lasting happiness


                                    514

                      Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       awaiting them.”
944.   Do people have the right to take their own life?
       “No! Only God has that right. Those who intentionally
       commit suicide commit a transgression against this law.”
       – Is suicide always intentional?
       “Insane individuals who kill themselves do not know what
       they are doing.”
945.   What is to be thought of those who commit suicide because
       they are dissatisfied with life?
       “Folly! Why didn’t they work? Life would not have seemed
       so heavy to them.”
946.   What about those who resort to suicide in order to escape from
       the troubles and disappointments of this world?
       “Poor spirits, who do not have the courage to bear the
       misfortunes of life! God helps those who suffer but
       not those who have neither strength nor courage. The
       tribulations of life are meant as trials or expiations. Happy
       are they who bear them without complaining, for they
       shall be rewarded! But woe to those who in their impiety
       hope to find salvation in chance! Chance or luck – to
       borrow their own language – may in fact favor them for
       a moment, but only to make them later and more cruelly
       feel the emptiness of their words.”
       – Won’t those who have driven an unhappy person to this act
       of despair suffer the consequences of their action?
       “Unfortunate beings! They will have to answer for it as for
       a murder.”
947.   Can those who have become disheartened with necessity and
       who allow themselves to die of despair be considered as having


                                515

                        Part Four – Chapter I


       committed suicide?
       “It is suicide, but those who have caused it, or those who
       could have prevented it, are guiltier than those for whom
       clemency awaits. However, do not think they will be entirely
       absolved if they lacked firmness and perseverance, or failed
       to make the best use of their intelligence to get themselves
       out of their difficulties. They will be even more unfortunate
       if their despair was the child of pride; i.e., if they were
       one of those whose pride paralyzes their intelligence, who
       would be ashamed at having to earn their living by manual
       labor, and who would prefer to die of starvation rather
       than descend from what they call their social position!
       Isn’t there a hundred times more greatness and dignity in
       struggling against adversity, in braving the criticism of a
       futile and selfish society, which only shows goodwill toward
       those who lack nothing, and which turns its back on you
       in your time of need? To throw away one’s life because of
       the considerations of such a society is a stupid thing since
       society will not care about it in the least.”
948.   Is suicide committed in order to escape the shame of an evil act
       as reprehensible as suicide committed out of despair?
       “Suicide does not erase the wrong. On the contrary, it is a
       second wrong added to the first. Those who have the courage
       to do evil should have the courage to bear the consequences.
       God is the one who judges. Moreover, depending on the
       cause, God can at times lessen its punishment.”
949.   Is suicide excusable when committed in order to avoid
       bringing shame on one’s children or family?
       “Those who act under this belief do no good at all;
       however, they think they do, and God will take their
       intention into account, for their suicide will be a self-


                                516

                         Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       imposed expiation. The wrong is mitigated by their
       intention, but it is a wrong nonetheless. Besides, if you
       would get rid of your social prejudices and abuses, you
       would not have any more suicides.”
         Those who take their own life in order to escape the shame of
         an evil act prove that they attach more value to the estimation of
         others than to that of God, because they will return to the spirit life
         burdened with their iniquities and will have deprived themselves
         of the means of atoning for them during life. God is often less
         unforgiving than people. God pardons those who sincerely repent
         and takes into account our efforts at reparation; however, suicide
         does not repair anything.

950.   What is to be thought of those who take their own life in the
       hope of arriving sooner at a better life?
       “Another folly! Let them do good and they will be surer
       to reach such a state. Their suicide will only delay their
       entrance into a better world and they themselves will ask to
       come back in order to complete the life that they cut short
       through a wrong-headed idea. A wrong, no matter what it
       may be, never opens the sanctuary of the elect to anyone.”
951.   Isn’t the sacrifice of one’s life sometimes meritorious when it is made
       in order to save the lives of others or to be useful to one’s neighbor?
       “In accordance with such intention, it is sublime, and such
       a sacrifice of life is therefore not a suicide. However, God
       opposes a meaningless sacrifice and cannot look upon it
       with pleasure if it is tarnished by pride. A sacrifice is not
       meritorious unless it is selfless. Unfortunately, those who
       make such a sacrifice sometimes have ulterior motives, and
       this decreases its value in God’s sight.”
         Every sacrifice made at the cost of our own happiness is a supremely
         meritorious act in God’s sight, for it is the practice of the law of
         charity. Additionally, since life is the earthly asset that we value the


                                    517

                          Part Four – Chapter I


         most, those who renounce it for the good of their neighbor do not
         commit a crime: they perform a sacrifice. Nonetheless, before doing
         so, they should consider whether their life might not be more useful
         than their death.

952.   Is it considered suicide for those who die as victims of the
       abuse of their own passions, which they knew would hasten
       their end, but which they could no longer resist because habit
       turned their passions into true physical needs?
       “It is a moral suicide. Don’t you see that they are doubly
       guilty in such a case? They lack courage and yield to
       brutishness. Moreover, they forget about God.”
       – Are they more or less guilty than those who shorten their life
       out of despair?
       “They are guiltier because they had time to reason about
       their suicide. For those who commit suicide on the spur
       of the moment, there is sometimes a kind of delirium that
       approaches insanity. The former will be punished much
       more than the latter because punishments are always in
       proportion to the awareness of one’s wrong-doing.”
953.   When individuals see an inevitable and terrible death in
       front of them, is it wrong to shorten their suffering by a few
       moments through intentional death?
       “It is always wrong not to wait for the term set by God.
       Besides, how can they tell with certainty whether their time
       has indeed come – despite appearances – or whether they
       might receive some unexpected help at the last moment?”
       – We admit that suicide is reprehensible under ordinary
       circumstances, but we are supposing a case in which death is
       inevitable, and in which life is only shortened by a few instants.
       “Nevertheless, it displays a lack of resignation and of
       submission to the will of the Creator.”

                                   518

                       Earthly Joys and Sorrows


       – What in this case are the consequences of such action?
       “As always, an expiation in proportion to the seriousness
       of the wrong, according to the circumstances.”
954.   Is an imprudent act that compromises life without necessity
       reprehensible?
       “There is no culpability when there is no positive intention
       or consciousness of doing harm.”
955.   Are the women who in some countries intentionally burn
       themselves to death over the body of their husband to be
       considered as having committed suicide, and must they suffer
       the consequences of it?
       “They obey a prejudice, and usually do it more out of
       coercion than of their own will. They believe they are
       fulfilling a duty, and this is not what characterizes suicide.
       Their excuse is their ignorance and their lack of moral
       development. Such barbarous and stupid customs will
       disappear with civilization.”
956.   Do those who cannot bear the loss of loved ones and kill themselves
       in the hope of rejoining them accomplish their objective?
       “The result for them is much different than what they
       hoped for. Instead of being reunited with the objects of their
       affection, they keep themselves away from them even longer
       because God cannot reward an act of cowardice, an insult
       which demonstrates distrust in divine providence. They will
       pay for that moment of insanity with afflictions even greater
       than those they wished to shorten, and they will not have
       the compensation they had hoped for.” (See nos. 934 ff.)
957.   In general, what are the consequences of suicide on the state of
       the spirit?
       “The consequences of suicide vary widely. There are no


                                  519

                  Part Four – Chapter I


set penalties and in all cases they are always relative to
the causes that produced them. One consequence, from
which those who commit suicide cannot escape, however,
is disappointment. Besides, the fate is not the same for all –
it depends on circumstances. Some expiate their wrong at
once, whereas others do so in a new life that will be worse
than the one whose course they have interrupted.”
 Observation has in fact confirmed that the consequences of suicide
 are not always the same. However, there are some that are a common
 thread to all cases of violent death and the aftermath of the sudden
 interruption of life. Foremost among them is the persistence of the
 link that ties the spirit to the body and which is almost always at
 its full strength when prematurely ruptured – unlike natural death
 wherein this link weakens gradually and is often undone before life
 is completely extinguished. The consequences of these unfortunate
 events are the prolongation of spiritual confusion followed by the
 illusion which, for a longer or shorter period, causes the spirit to
 believe it is still among the living. (See nos. 155, 165)
 In some suicides, the affinity that persists between the spirit and the
 body produces a sort of repercussion of the state of the body on the
 spirit, who is thus compelled to witness the effects of decomposition,
 experiencing a sensation full of anguish and horror. This state can
 continue as long as the life which was interrupted ought to have
 lasted. This consequence is not the general rule. However, in no case
 are those who committed suicide freed from the consequences of their
 lack of courage; sooner or later, they will expiate this wrong in one
 way or another. Thus, certain spirits who had been very unhappy on
 earth have stated that they had committed suicide in their preceding
 existence, and that they had voluntarily submitted to new trials in
 order to try to bear them with more resignation. For some it comes
 in the form of a bond to matter, from which they vainly seek to free
 themselves in order to go to happier worlds, but whose access is denied
 to them. For the majority, it is regret for having done something
 needless from which they have reaped only disappointment.
 Religion, morality and philosophy condemn suicide as being


                            520

                Earthly Joys and Sorrows


contrary to the law of nature. All tell us, in principle, that we have
no right to intentionally shorten our own life. But why don’t we have
that right? Why aren’t we free to put an end to our own sufferings?
It is up to the Spiritist Doctrine to address these questions and to
show through the actual examples of those who have succumbed
to it that suicide is not only a wrong that violates moral law (a
consideration of little importance to some individuals), but a
reckless act that will bring no benefit – in fact, the result will be
quite the contrary. It is not according to some theory that Spiritism
teaches us this. Spiritism has set actual examples right in front of us.

          Nothingness. The Future Life
958.   Why are human beings instinctively horrified of nothingness?
       “Because there is no such thing as nothingness.”
959.   Where does our instinctive sentiment of a future life come from?
       “We have already told you: prior to its incarnation, the
       spirit knows all these things and the soul retains a vague
       memory of what it knows and of what it saw in its spirit
       state.” (See no. 393)
         In all ages, people have occupied themselves with the future beyond
         the grave. This is very natural. Whatever importance they may
         give to the present life, they cannot help but consider how brief,
         and especially, how precarious it is since it can be cut short at any
         moment; hence, they can never be sure of tomorrow. What becomes


                                   523

                         Part Four – Chapter II


        of them after the fatal instant? This is a serious question, for it does
        not deal with a few years, but with eternity. Those who will have
        to spend many years in a foreign country concern themselves with
        the situation in which they will find themselves. So why do we not
        concern ourselves with the situation we will face when we leave this
        world behind since it will be forever?
        The idea of nothingness is repugnant to reason. When those who
        are the most unconcerned in this life arrive at the final moment,
        they ask themselves what will become of them and they wait for it
        against their will.
        To believe in God without accepting a future life would be nonsense.
        The sentiment of a better life is to be found in the inner being of all
        and God did not place it there needlessly.
        The future life implies the preservation of our individuality after
        death. What good would it do to survive the body if our moral
        essence must be lost in the ocean of the infinite? The consequences
        of that would be the same as nothingness.



  The Intuition of Future Joys and Sorrows
960.   Where does the belief in future rewards and punishments,
       which is found in all cultures, come from?
       “It is always the same thing: a presentiment of reality
       imparted to human beings by their spirit. You should
       know that it is not uselessly that an inner voice speaks
       to you; your mistake is in not listening to it. If you
       thought well and frequently about this, you would make
       yourselves better.”
961.   At the moment of death, what is the dominant sentiment in
       most people: doubt, fear or hope?
       “Doubt for hardhearted skeptics, fear for the guilty and
       hope for the good.”

                                   524

                       Future Joys and Sorrows


962.   Why are there skeptics since the soul brings the sentiment of
       spiritual things to everyone?
       “There are fewer skeptics than you might think. During
       life, many pretend they are bold out of pride, but at the
       moment of death they cease being boastful.”
        The consequences of the future life stem from the responsibility for
        our acts. Regarding the apportionment of the happiness to which all
        aspire, reason and justice tell us that the good and the wicked could
        not possibly be mixed together. God cannot will for some to enjoy
        good things without effort, while willing for others only to obtain
        them through effort and perseverance.
        The idea that God applies divine justice and goodness through the
        wisdom of the divine laws does not allow us to believe that the
        righteous and the wicked are at the same level in God’s sight. Nor
        can we doubt that someday the former will receive a reward for the
        good they have done, and that the latter will receive a punishment
        for the evil they have done. That is why our innate sense of justice
        gives us the intuition of future rewards and punishments.



              God’s Intervention in
            Punishments and Rewards
963.   Is God concerned personally with each individual? Isn’t God
       too great and aren’t we too small for each individual in
       particular to have any importance in the divine sight?
       “God is concerned with all created beings, no matter
       how small they may be. Nothing is too small for God’s
       goodness.”
964.   Must God be concerned with each of our actions in order to
       reward or punish us? Aren’t most of such actions insignificant
       to God?


                                  525

                 Part Four – Chapter II


“God has established the divine laws that regulate all your
actions. If you violate them, the fault is yours. Obviously,
when people commit an excess, God does not pronounce
sentence on them by saying, for example, ‘You are a glutton
and I am going to punish you.’ But God has set a limit:
maladies, and sometimes death, are the consequences of
excess. Thus the punishment – it results from breaking a
law. Everything happens this way.”
 All our actions are subjected to the laws of God. No matter how
 unimportant they seem to us, they could still be a violation of those
 laws. If we suffer the consequences of such violation, we have only
 ourselves to blame. We are thus the artisans of our own future
 happiness or unhappiness.
 This truth becomes evident in the following moral: A father
 has given education and instruction to his son, i.e., the means
 of knowing how to conduct himself. He cedes a field to him to
 cultivate, and says to him, “I have given you the rules to follow
 and all the necessary implements for rendering this field productive,
 thereby ensuring your living. I have taught you how to understand
 those rules. If you follow them, your field will yield abundantly and
 will furnish you repose in your old age. If you do not follow them,
 it will yield nothing and you will die of hunger.” Having said this,
 he leaves him free to act as he pleases.
 Is it not true that the field will produce in the ratio of the care
 taken in its cultivation and that all negligence will rebound by
 harming the harvest? The son will therefore be happy or unhappy
 in his old age according to how he has followed or neglected the
 rules outlined by his father. God is even more provident, because
 God warns us at every moment whether we are doing right or
 doing wrong by sending us spirits to inspire us; however, we do
 not listen to them. There is also this further difference: God gives
 us recourse through new lives to repair our past errors, whereas
 the son of whom we have been speaking will not have the same
 opportunities if he misuses his time.

                       Future Joys and Sorrows


   The Nature of Future Joys and Sorrows
965.   Is there anything material about the joys and sorrows of the
       soul after death?
       “They cannot be material since the soul is not matter.
       Common sense says so. There is nothing carnal about future
       joys and sorrows, and that is why they are a thousand times
       more vivid than those experienced on earth. Once disengaged
       from matter, the spirit is more impressionable; matter no
       longer weakens its sensitivity.” (See nos. 237-257)
966.   Why do human beings have such crude and absurd ideas
       about the joys and sorrows of the future life?
       “Because their intelligence is not yet sufficiently developed.
       Does the child comprehend in the same way as the adult?
       Besides, it also depends on how they have been taught – that
       is the point at which there is the most need for reform.
       “Your language is too incomplete to express what exists
       beyond your reach. Thus, it has been necessary to make
       comparisons, and you have taken such images and
       figures as reality itself. However, as people become more
       enlightened, they better comprehend the things that their
       language cannot express.”
967.   What does the happiness of good spirits consist of?
       “In knowing all things; in feeling no hatred, jealousy,
       envy, ambition or any of the passions that make people
       unhappy. The love that unites them is a source of supreme
       happiness. They do not experience the needs, sufferings
       or anxieties of material life. They are happy with the good
       they do. Moreover, the happiness of spirits is always in
       proportion to their progress. Actually, only the pure
       spirits enjoy supreme happiness; however, this does not

                                527

                        Part Four – Chapter II


       mean the others are unhappy. Between the evil ones and
       the perfected ones, there is an infinity of gradations, in
       which enjoyments are proportioned to their moral state.
       Those who are already sufficiently advanced understand
       the happiness of those who have reached that state before
       them and they aspire to it, but for them it is a reason for
       emulation and not jealousy. They know that it depends on
       their own efforts to reach it and they labor toward that end
       with the calmness of a pure conscience. They are happy at
       no longer having to suffer what is endured by evil spirits.”
968.   You place the absence of material needs among the conditions
       of happiness for spirits. But isn’t the satisfaction of those needs
       a source of enjoyment for humans?
       “Yes, the gratification of their animal passions. When they
       cannot satisfy those needs, it is torture.”
969.   What are we to understand when it is said that pure spirits
       are gathered in the bosom of God and employed in singing
       praises to God?
       “It is an allegory to give you an idea of the knowledge
       they possess about the perfections of God because they see
       and comprehend God. Like all other allegories, however,
       you must not take it literally. Everything in nature sings,
       from the grain of sand on up, proclaiming the power, the
       wisdom, and the goodness of God. But you must not
       suppose that the blessed spirits are absorbed in eternal
       contemplation. That would be a monotonous and dull
       happiness, and furthermore, a selfish one because their
       existence would be an unending uselessness. They no
       longer suffer the tribulations of corporeal life, which in
       itself is already an enjoyment. Later, as we have told you,
       they know and comprehend all things, and they make
       use of the intelligence they have acquired by aiding the

                                  528

                        Future Joys and Sorrows


       progress of other spirits. That is their occupation, and at
       the same time, it is their enjoyment.”
970.   What do the sufferings of low order spirits consist of?
       “They are as varied as the causes that produce them and
       are in proportion to their degree of impurity, in the same
       way that enjoyments are in proportion to their degree of
       purity. We can thus sum them up: coveting everything they
       lack to be happy but not being able to obtain it; seeing
       happiness but being unable to attain it; regret, jealousy,
       rage and despair arising from everything that keeps them
       from being happy; remorse and an indescribable mental
       anguish. They long for all sorts of enjoyments but cannot
       satisfy them. That is what tortures them.”
971.   Is the influence exerted by spirits over one another always good?
       “It is always good on the part of good spirits, of course.
       However, perverse spirits endeavor to draw aside from the
       path of repentance and the good those whom they think
       are susceptible of being misled, and whom they often led
       into evil during their earthly lives.”
       – So death does not deliver us from temptation?
       “No, but the action of evil spirits is much less significant over
       other spirits than over human beings because other spirits are
       no longer sustained by material passions.” (See no. 996)
972.   In what way do evil spirits tempt other spirits since they
       cannot count on the passions to help them?
       “Although the passions no longer exist in the material
       sense, they still exist mentally in little-evolved spirits.
       They lure their victims to places where they can witness
       the spectacle of those passions and everything that
       arouses them.”


                                 529

                           Part Four – Chapter II


       – But what end do those passions serve since they no longer
       have any real object?
       “That is precisely what comprises their torture: misers see
       gold that they cannot possess; debauchees see orgies that
       they cannot take part in; the haughty see the honors that
       they envy, but which they cannot enjoy.”
973.   What are the greatest sufferings evil spirits have to endure?
       “It is utterly impossible to describe the mental tortures
       that are the punishment for some crimes. The actual
       spirits who suffer them find it difficult to give you an idea
       of them, but assuredly, the most frightful is the thought of
       being condemned forever.”
         People’s idea about the joys and sorrows of the soul after death
         is more accurate or less according to their state of intelligence.
         As they become more evolved, their thinking also becomes more
         refined and more divested of materiality. They comprehend things
         more rationally and they cease to take the images of figurative
         language literally. The most enlightened reasoning teaches us that
         the soul is an entirely spiritual being and that it cannot be affected
         by impressions that act only upon matter. However, it does not
         follow that it is free of suffering or that it is not punished for its
         wrongdoing. (See no. 237)
         Spirit communications are meant to show us the future state of the
         soul, no longer as a matter of theory, but as a reality. They place before
         us all the vicissitudes of life beyond the grave, but at the same time
         they also show us that they are the perfectly logical consequences of
         the terrestrial life. Although divested of the fantastic accoutrements
         created by the human imagination, they are nonetheless painful for
         those who have made a bad use of their faculties. The diversity of
         such consequences is infinite, but may be generally summed up in
         the fact that each soul is punished for its specific sins. Some are
         punished by the incessant sight of the evil they committed; others,
         by regret, fear, shame, doubt, loneliness, darkness and separation
         from those who are dear to them, etc.


                                     530

                         Future Joys and Sorrows


974.   Where does the doctrine of eternal fire come from?
       “An image taken as reality – like so many others.”
       – But couldn’t this fear lead to a good result?
       “See for yourself whether or not it even restrains those who
       teach it. If you teach things that reason will later reject,
       you produce an impression that will be neither durable
       nor healthy.”
         Incapable of translating the nature of those sufferings into their
         own language, humans have not found a more forceful comparison
         for such sufferings than fire, which represents the cruelest torture
         possible and is the symbol of the most potent action. It is for
         this reason that the belief in eternal fire may be traced back to
         earliest antiquity, and modern cultures have inherited it from their
         ancestors. Furthermore, it is for this reason that in their figurative
         language they speak of fiery passions, burning with love, burning
         with jealousy, etc.

975.   Do low order spirits comprehend the happiness of the morally
       upright?
       “Yes, and that is what tortures them, for they understand
       that they are deprived of it due to their own fault. That is
       why the spirit, freed from matter, aspires to a new corporeal
       existence. It knows that each existence, if well employed,
       will shorten the duration of that torment. With that in
       mind, it chooses the trials that will expiate its wrongs. You
       must remember that the spirit suffers for all the wrong it
       has done or which it has intentionally caused, for all the
       good that it might have done but didn’t, and for all the evil
       that resulted from the good it failed to do.
       “The discarnate spirit is no longer enveloped by the veil of
       matter. It is as though it has emerged from a fog and sees what
       is keeping it from happiness. Hence, it suffers even more


                                   531

                         Part Four – Chapter II


       because it understands the extent of its guilt. For the spirit,
       illusion no longer exists; it sees things as they really are.”
       Spirits in the errant state, on the one hand, take in all their
       past existences at a glance; on the other, they foresee the
       promised future and comprehend what they lack to reach
       it. Like a hiker who has reached the top of a hill, they see
       both the course that they have already traveled and how
       far they must yet travel to reach their destination.
976.   Is the sight of suffering spirits a cause of affliction for the good
       ones, and if so, does it disturb their happiness?
       “It is not an affliction, because they know that such evil
       will end, and they help the others in their betterment by
       lending them a helping hand. That is their occupation and
       a joy when they succeed.”
       – This is understandable for spirits who are unknown or
       indifferent to them, but doesn’t the sight of the sorrows and
       sufferings of those who were dear to them on earth disturb
       their happiness?
       “If they did not see your sufferings, it would mean they
       are estranged from you after death. Religion tells you
       that souls continue to see you but that they regard your
       afflictions from another point of view – they know that
       your sufferings will aid your advancement if you bear them
       with resignation. Such spirits are more afflicted by the lack
       of courage that holds you back than by the sufferings they
       know are only temporary.”
977.   Since spirits cannot hide their thoughts from one another, and
       since all the acts of their lives are known, does it follow that those
       who are guilty continually see their victims as being present?
       “Common sense tells you that it cannot be otherwise.”


                                   532

                        Future Joys and Sorrows


       – Is this revealing of all its reprehensible acts and the perpetual
       sight of its victims a punishment for the guilty spirit?
       “More than you might think, but it only lasts until it
       has expiated its wrong-doing either as a spirit or as an
       individual in new corporeal existences.”
         When we find ourselves in the world of spirits, our entire past
         will be uncovered; the good and the evil we have done will also be
         known. Those who have done evil will try in vain to avoid the sight
         of their victims and their inevitable presence will be an incessant
         punishment and regret for them until they have expiated their
         wrongs. Moral individuals, on the contrary, will only encounter
         friendly and benevolent eyes everywhere.
         For evil persons, there is no greater torment on earth than the
         presence of their victims and that is why they always avoid them.
         What will become of them when, divested of the illusion of the
         passions, they comprehend the evil they have done, see their most
         secret actions revealed, find their hypocrisy unmasked, and perceive
         that they cannot hide from their victim’s sight? To the same extent
         that the soul of the wicked feels shame, regret, and remorse, that of
         the righteous enjoys perfect peace.

978.   Doesn’t the memory of the wrongs committed by a soul while still
       imperfect disturb its happiness even after it has purified itself?
       “No, because it has atoned for its wrongs and has come
       forth victorious from the trials to which it had submitted
       itself for that very purpose.”
979.   Aren’t the trials it still must undergo in order to complete its
       purification a heavy concern that disturbs its happiness?
       “In the case of the soul that still remains tainted, yes. That
       is why it cannot enjoy perfect happiness until it is entirely
       pure. Nonetheless, for the soul who has already progressed,
       the thought of the trials it still must undergo has nothing
       painful about it.”


                                   533

                          Part Four – Chapter II


         A soul who has reached a certain degree of purity enjoys happiness.
         A feeling of sweet satisfaction surrounds it and it feels happy with
         everything it sees and all that surrounds it. The veil has been lifted,
         uncovering the marvels and mysteries of creation, and divine
         perfections appear in all their splendor.

980.   Is the link of affinity that unites spirits of the same order a
       source of happiness for them?
       “The unity of spirits who are attuned to one another
       through the good is one of their greatest joys because they do
       not have to fear seeing that unity disturbed by selfishness.
       On entirely spiritual worlds, they form families animated
       by the same sentiment, and from that they derive their
       spiritual happiness – the same as on your world when
       you group yourselves into categories and enjoy a certain
       pleasure when you get together. The pure and sincere
       affection they feel, and of which they are the object, is
       a source of happiness. There are neither false friends nor
       hypocrites among them.”
         Humans enjoy the first-fruits of this happiness on the earth when
         they meet souls with whom they can enter into a pure and holy
         unity. In a life of greater purity, such pleasure will be beyond words
         and unlimited because they will only meet sympathetic souls whom
         selfishness has not made indifferent. In nature everything is love;
         selfishness is what destroys it.

981.   Regarding the future state of the spirit, is there any difference
       between those who have feared death and those who have
       looked upon it with indifference or even with joy?
       “The difference can be very great, although this is
       usually obliterated by the causes that produce such fear
       or desire. Those who fear death or those who desire
       it may be moved by very different sentiments, and it
       is these sentiments that will influence a spirit’s future


                                    534

                         Future Joys and Sorrows


       state. For instance, it is obvious that those who desire
       death only because it will put an end to their troubles
       are, in reality, complaining against Providence and
       against the trials they must endure.”
982.   Is it necessary to make a profession of faith in Spiritism and to
       believe in the manifestations in order to ensure our well-being
       in the next life?
       “If that were so, then all those who do not believe in them,
       or who have not had the opportunity of learning anything
       about them, would be disinherited, which is absurd. Only
       the good ensures one’s future well-being. The good is
       always the good, whatever the path that leads to it.” (See
       nos. 165-799)
         Belief in Spiritism aids our self-improvement by ensuring our
         ideas regarding certain points about the future; it hastens the
         advancement of individuals and the masses because it enables us to
         ascertain what we will be someday, making it a support and a light
         to guide us. Spiritism teaches us to bear our trials with patience and
         resignation, and turns us away from doing things that might delay
         our future happiness. Through its teachings, Spiritism contributes
         to our future joys, but it has never stated that we may not attain to
         that happiness without it.



               Temporary Punishments
983.   Since a spirit who expiates its wrongs in a new life undergoes
       physical suffering, is it correct to say that after death the soul
       experiences only mental suffering?
       “It is very true that the tribulations of life represent a
       suffering for the reincarnated soul, but it is only the body
       that undergoes physical suffering.



                                   535

                        Part Four – Chapter II


       “You usually say that a dead person no longer suffers, but
       this is not always true. As a spirit it no longer suffers physical
       pain, but depending on the wrongs it has committed,
       it may have mental sufferings still more severe, and in
       a new existence it may be even unhappier. Those who
       have wasted their wealth will in turn beg and suffer the
       privations of poverty; the proud will undergo humiliations
       of every kind; those who have abused authority and have
       treated their subordinates with disdain and harshness will
       be forced to obey masters who are even harsher. All the
       punishments and tribulations of life are expiations for
       wrongs of another life when they are not the consequence
       of wrongs committed in the present one. When you have
       departed your present life, you will understand this better.
       (See nos. 273, 393, 399)
       “Those who believe themselves to be happy on earth
       because they can satisfy their passions are those who make
       the least effort at self-improvement. Frequently, they begin
       to expiate such ephemeral happiness in this life but they
       will certainly atone for it in another existence as material
       as this one.”
984.   Are the troubles of life always punishment for current wrongs?
       “No. We have already told you that they are trials imposed
       by God or chosen by you yourselves in the spirit state
       before your reincarnation in order to expiate the wrongs
       committed in a former life. No infraction of the laws of
       God, and especially of the law of justice, ever remains
       unpunished, and if punishment is not experienced in this
       life, it certainly will be in another. This is why persons
       whom you regard as morally upright frequently still feel
       the consequences of their actions from past existences.”

985.   Is the reincarnation of a soul on a less dense world a reward?
       “It is a consequence of its purification, for as spirits
       become purified, they reincarnate on successively better
       worlds to the point where they completely rid themselves
       of all matter and moral imperfections in order to eternally
       enjoy the bliss of pure spirits in the bosom of God.”
         On worlds in which existence is less material than on this one,
         the needs are less dense and all physical suffering is less acute. The
         inhabitants no longer know the evil passions that on less evolved
         worlds make them each other’s enemies. Having no motives for
         hatred or jealousy, they live in peace, practicing the law of justice,
         love and charity. They do not know the worries and anguish that
         are born from envy, pride and selfishness, and which comprise the
         torment of our terrestrial existence. (See nos. 172, 182)

986.   Can spirits who have progressed during their terrestrial
       existence sometimes reincarnate on the same world?
       “Yes, if they have not been able to accomplish their mission
       and if they ask to complete it in a new existence; however, in
       that case, it is no longer an expiation for them.” (See no.173)
987.   What becomes of those who, without doing evil, nevertheless
       do nothing to shake off the influence of matter?
       “Since they have made no progress towards perfection,
       they must begin a new existence similar to the one they
       have left behind. They remain at a standstill, and thus can
       prolong the suffering of their expiation.”
988.   There are persons whose lives flow in perfect serenity, and
       having no worries, they are entirely free of concerns. Is their
       happy existence evidence that they have nothing to expiate
       from any former existence?
       “Do you know many like that? If you think you do, you are
       mistaken. Usually, such serenity is no more than apparent.


                                   537

                        Part Four – Chapter II


       They could have chosen such an existence, but when they
       leave it behind they perceive that it has not helped them to
       progress. Then, like those who have been idle, they regret
       the time they wasted. Bear in mind that spirits cannot
       acquire knowledge and evolve except through activity.
       If they choose to rest in a worry-free existence, they do
       not advance. They are like those who, according to your
       customs, need to work but go for a walk instead, or go to
       sleep in order to avoid it. Also bear in mind that each of you
       will have to answer for any intentional inactivity during your
       life, and that such uselessness is always fatal to your future
       happiness. The sum of future happiness is always exactly in
       proportion to the sum of the good you have done. In the
       same way, your unhappiness is always in proportion to the
       sum of the evil you have done, and to the number of those
       whom you have made unhappy.”
989.   There are persons who, although not positively wicked, make
       everyone around them unhappy because of their character.
       What is the consequence of this for them?
       “Such persons are assuredly not good. They will expiate
       this wrong by the sight of those whom they have made
       unhappy, and this will comprise a constant reproach for
       them. Then, in another existence, they will endure all that
       they have caused others to endure.”


             Expiation and Repentance
990.   Does repentance take place in the corporeal or the spirit state?
       “In the spirit state. But it may also take place in the corporeal
       state when you clearly comprehend the difference between
       good and evil.”


                                 538

                       Future Joys and Sorrows


991.   What is the consequence of repentance in the spirit state?
       “The spirit’s desire for a new incarnation in order to purify
       itself. It comprehends the imperfections that have kept
       it from being happy and it aspires to a new existence in
       which it can expiate its wrongs.” (See nos. 332, 975)
992.   What is the consequence of repentance in the corporeal state?
       “Advancement while in the present corporeal life – if one has
       the time to mend one’s wrongs. Whenever your conscience
       reproaches you or shows you an imperfection, you may
       always improve yourselves.”
993.   Aren’t there individuals who have an instinct for evil only and
       who are incapable of repenting?
       “I have told you that the spirit must progress without
       ceasing. Those who in this life have only an instinct for
       evil will have an instinct for the good in another one, and
       that is why they are reborn many times. All must advance
       and reach the objective at their own pace, more quickly
       or more slowly, according to their desire. Those who
       only have an instinct for the good are already purified
       because they might have had an instinct for evil in a prior
       existence.” (See no. 894)
994.   Do wicked individuals, who during their life did not recognize
       their wrongs, always recognize them after death?
       “Yes, they always recognize them and suffer even more
       because they regret all the evil they did or of which they were
       the intentional cause. Nevertheless, repentance is not always
       immediate. There are spirits who obstinately persist in doing
       wrong in spite of their suffering; but sooner or later they will
       see that they have taken an erroneous path and repentance
       will follow. It is for their enlightenment that good spirits
       work, and towards which you yourselves should work.”

                                539

                        Part Four – Chapter II


995.   Are there spirits who, although not wicked, are nonetheless
       indifferent about their fate?
       “There are spirits who do not occupy themselves
       with anything useful, keeping themselves in a state of
       expectancy. They suffer in proportion to their inactivity,
       however, and since everything must lead to progress, such
       progress is realized through suffering.”
       – Don’t they desire to shorten their suffering?
       “Undoubtedly they do, but they lack the willpower for
       what it would take to alleviate it. How many individuals
       among you would rather die poor than work?”
996.   Since spirits see the harm that results from their wrongs, how
       is it that some aggravate their position and prolong their state
       of imperfection by doing evil as spirits and turning people
       aside from the path of the good?
       “Some spirits put off their repentance. Furthermore, a
       spirit who repents can afterward still allow itself to be
       drawn back onto the immoral path by spirits who are even
       less evolved.” (See no. 971)
997.   We sometimes see spirits who are notoriously imperfect, but
       who are open to the good sentiments and prayers made on
       their behalf. How is it that other spirits whom we might
       believe are more enlightened show a callousness and cynicism
       impossible to break?
       “Prayer is only effective in the case of spirits who repent.
       Those who, driven by pride, revolt against God and
       persist in their wrong-doings, multiplying them further
       as unfortunate spirits do, cannot and never will receive
       the benefits of prayer until the day the light of repentance
       dawns on them.” (See no. 664)

                         Future Joys and Sorrows


         We must not forget that after the death of their body, spirits are not
         suddenly transformed. If their life was reprehensible, it was because
         they were imperfect. Death does not change that by suddenly
         turning them into perfect beings. They may persist in their errors,
         their wrong ideas and their prejudices until they become enlightened
         through study, reflection and suffering.

998.   Is expiation accomplished in the corporeal state or in the
       spirit state?
       “It is accomplished in the corporeal existence through
       the trials the spirit must undergo, and in the spirit life
       through the mental sufferings arising from its state of
       imperfection.”
999.   Is sincere repentance during life sufficient to extinguish a
       spirit’s wrongs and enable it to merit God’s grace?
       “Repentance helps to improve the spirit, but the past must
       nevertheless be expiated.”
       – That being the case, what would be the consequences for a
       criminal who said that since he was expiating his past then
       there was no reason for him to have to repent?
       “If he persists in the thought of evil, his expiation will be
       all the longer and more painful.”
1000. Can we redeem our wrongs in the present life?
       “Yes, by making reparation for them. Do not suppose,
       however, that you can redeem them through a few childish
       privations or through donations after your death when you
       no longer need your assets. God does not value a sterile
       repentance, which is always easy and costs no more than
       mourning by beating on one’s chest. The loss of a finger
       in rendering a service effaces a greater number of wrongs
       than mortifying one’s whole flesh for years without any
       other purpose than one’s own self-interest. (See no. 726)


                                   541

                         Part Four – Chapter II


        “Evil can only be atoned for by means of the good, and
        reparation does not have any merit if it does not strike
        human beings in their pride or their material interests.
        “What good would it do on our behalf if after our death
        we were to restore property which we acquired wrongly,
        and which we had thoroughly enjoyed during life, but
        which is now of no further use to us?
        “What good would it do to be deprived of a few useless
        and superfluous enjoyments if the evil we had done to
        someone remained in place?
        “Lastly, what good would it do to humble oneself before
        God if we maintained our pride in dealing with others?”
        (See nos. 720, 721)
1001. Is there any merit in ensuring that after our death the property
      we have left behind will be put to good use?
        “Merit is not quite the right term, but it is always better
        than doing nothing. Unfortunately, those who only give
        after their death are usually more selfish than generous –
        they want the honors of charitable acts without having to
        practice them. Those who deprive themselves during life
        have a double advantage: the merit of sacrifice and the
        pleasure of witnessing the happiness of those whom they
        have benefited. Selfishness, however, is always ready to
        whisper that whatever you give away will deprive you of
        your own enjoyment, and since selfishness speaks louder
        than selflessness and charity, people hold on to their
        possessions under the pretext that they are necessary for
        satisfying their needs and the requirements of their position
        in society. Pity those who do not know the pleasure of
        giving, for they have really deprived themselves of one
        of the purest and sweetest enjoyments of humankind. In

                        Future Joys and Sorrows


        subjecting them to the trial of wealth – so slippery and
        dangerous for their future – God has wished to give them
        by way of compensation the happiness of generosity, which
        they can enjoy right now in this world.” (See no. 814)
1002. What can be done when at their death individuals recognize
      their wrongs but do not have the time remaining to make
      amends? Is repentance enough in such a case?
        “Repentance hastens their rehabilitation but it does not
        absolve them. Don’t they have the whole future ahead,
        which will never be closed to them?”


     The Duration of Future Punishments
1003. Is the duration of the sufferings of the guilty in the future life
      arbitrary or subordinate to some law?
        “God never acts capriciously and everything in the
        universe is ruled by laws that reveal the divine wisdom
        and goodness.”
1004. What determines the duration of the sufferings of the guilty?
        “The length of time required for their improvement.
        Since the state of suffering or happiness is in proportion
        to a spirit’s degree of purification, the duration and
        nature of its sufferings depend on the time it takes to
        improve itself. As the spirit progresses and its sentiments
        become purer, its sufferings diminish and are changed
        to the same extent.”
                                                              St. Louis

1005. Does time for a suffering spirit seem longer or shorter than
      when it was incarnate?


                                  543

                         Part Four – Chapter II


        “It seems longer because sleep does not exist. It is only for
        spirits who have reached a certain degree of purification
        that time is effaced, so to speak, in the face of the infinite.”
        (See no. 240)
1006. Can the duration of a spirit’s suffering be eternal?
        “Of course, if it were to remain eternally evil; that is to say, if
        it were never to repent or improve itself, it would then suffer
        eternally. However, God has not created beings eternally
        devoted to evil. They were only created simple and ignorant,
        and all of them must progress over a longer or shorter period
        of time according to their own free will. This will can be
        belated to various degrees, just as there are children who are
        precocious to various degrees. Sooner or later, however, it
        will manifest itself by the irresistible need the spirit feels to
        leave its state of imperfection and to be happy. The law that
        governs the duration of suffering is therefore eminently wise
        and beneficent. It subordinates that duration to the spirit’s
        own efforts, never depriving it of its free will. If it makes a bad
        use of it, it will have to bear the consequences.”
                                                                St. Louis

1007. Are there spirits who never repent?
        “There are spirits who put off their repentance, but
        supposing that they will never improve would be to deny
        the law of progress and to assert that the child will never
        become an adult.”
                                                                St. Louis

1008. Does the duration of punishments always depend on the
      spirit’s own will or are there punishments that are imposed on
      it for a specific length of time?


                                   544

                       Future Joys and Sorrows


       “There are punishments that can be imposed on it for a
       specific length of time, but God, who wills only the good
       for God’s creatures, always welcomes its repentance. The
       spirit’s desire to improve is never fruitless.”
                                                             St. Louis

1009. Accordingly, the punishments imposed are never eternal?
       “Consult your own common sense and reason, and ask
       yourselves whether an eternal condemnation for a few moments
       of error would not be a negation of God’s goodness. In fact,
       what is the duration of a life, even if it were to last a hundred
       years, in comparison to eternity? Eternity! Can you understand
       that word? Suffering and torture without end and without
       hope for only a few wrongs! Doesn’t your reason reject such
       an idea? That the ancients saw in the Master of the Universe a
       terrible, jealous and vindictive God is understandable. In their
       ignorance, they attributed the human passions to the deity, but
       that is not the God of the Christians, who extols love, charity,
       mercy and the forgetfulness of offenses as the highest virtues.
       Wouldn’t God have the qualities that God demands as a duty?
       Isn’t there a contradiction in attributing to God both infinite
       goodness and infinite vengeance? You say that above all God
       is just and that humans do not understand the divine justice.
       Justice, however, does not exclude kindness, and God would
       not be kind in condemning most creatures to a horrible and
       everlasting punishment. Could God make justice obligatory
       for everyone if they were not given the means to comprehend
       it? Besides, isn’t justice sublime when, allied with goodness, it
       makes the duration of punishment depend on the efforts of the
       guilty to improve themselves? Therein you will find the truth
       of the precept ‘to each according to his deeds.’”
                                                        St. Augustine


                                 545

                Part Four – Chapter II


“Through all the means within your reach, strive to
combat and to eradicate the idea of eternal punishment,
a blasphemous notion against the justice and goodness
of God and the most abundant source of the incredulity,
materialism, and indifference that have pervaded the
masses from the time their intelligence began to develop.
The spirit who has just left the state of ignorance or is
about to become enlightened quickly comprehends this
monstrous injustice. Its reason rejects it, and then more
often than not, the spirit equates the eternal punishment
that it rejects with the God to whom it attributes this
condemnation. From this arise the innumerable ills that
have fallen upon you, and whose remedy we have come
to bring you. The task we have pointed out will be much
easier to accomplish, since the authorities from whom
the defenders of this belief have sought support have
avoided a formal pronouncement on this regard. Neither
the Councils nor the Church Fathers tackled this serious
question. Following the Evangelists themselves and taking
Christ’s allegorical words literally, if Christ did in fact
threaten the guilty with unquenchable, eternal fire, there
is absolutely nothing in Christ’s words that proves they are
condemned for all eternity.
“Poor lost sheep, learn to behold the Good Shepherd, who
approaches you and who, far from wanting to banish you
forever from his presence, comes to find you in order to
lead you back to the fold. Prodigal children, leave your
willful exile. Turn your path toward the Father, who opens
his arms to you and who is always ready to celebrate your
return to his family.”

“Wars of words! Wars of words! Haven’t you shed enough
blood? Are the inquisitional fires to be rekindled once
again? You argue over expressions such as ‘eternal suffering’
and ‘eternal punishment’. Don’t you know that what you
understand today by eternity was not understood in the same
way by the ancients? Let theologians consult the sources and
like you they will discover that the Hebrew text does not
give the word the same meaning that the Greek, the Latin,
and modern translations have rendered as everlasting and
unpardonable punishment. The ‘eternity’ of the punishment
corresponds to the evil that has occurred. Yes, so long as
evil exists among humans, punishments will continue.
It is in this relative sense that the sacred texts should be
interpreted. Eternal punishment is therefore relative and
not absolute. A day will come when all humans will don
the garments of innocence through repentance, and on that
day there will be no more groaning or gnashing of teeth.
It is true that your intelligence is limited, but even at this
stage it is still a gift from God, and with the help of reason
there will not be one single human of good faith who could
possibly understand eternal punishment in any different
way. Eternal punishment! How could that be? Only if we
believed that evil was also eternal! But only God is eternal
and God could not have created eternal evil. If such were
the case, we would have to deny one of the most beautiful
divine attributes: supreme power, for God would cease
to be supremely powerful the moment God introduced a
destructive element into creation. Humanity! Humanity!
No longer immerse your somber glance in the depths of the
earth, searching for these punishments. Weep, hope, expiate
and take comfort in the thought of a God who is infinitely
good, absolutely powerful and essentially just.”

“The objective of humankind is to gravitate toward divine
unity. For divine unity to occur, three things are necessary:
justice, love and knowledge. There are three things that
are contrary to and oppose this unity: ignorance, hatred
and injustice. I must tell you that you lie about these
fundamental principles when you compromise the idea
of God by exaggerating God’s severity. Furthermore, you
doubly compromise it when you allow the spirit of the
creature to think that the creature itself possesses more
clemency, gentleness, love, and true justice than you
attribute to the Infinite Being. You destroy the very idea
of hell by rendering it as ridiculous and unacceptable
to your minds as the horrendous spectacle of the
executions, the burnings at the stake and the tortures of
the Middle Ages is to your hearts! How can the idea of
hell be sustained at a time when blind reprisals have been
banished from human laws? Believe me, brothers and
sisters in God and in Jesus Christ; believe me and either
resign yourselves to letting all the dogmas you hold to be
unalterable perish in your hands, or breathe new life into
them by opening them up to the benevolent explanations
good spirits are now giving concerning them. The idea
of a hell with its glowing furnaces and boiling cauldrons
might be tolerated or admissible in a mythological age.
In the nineteenth century, however, it is nothing more
than an empty phantom that only serves to frighten little
children, who will no longer believe in it once they have
grown up. If you persist in such a frightening mythology,
you will engender disbelief, the origin of every sort of
social upheaval. I tremble at the idea of an entire social
order shaken and crumbling upon its very foundations
for lack of a penal sanction. People of ardent and living
faith, vanguards of the day of the light, let us join efforts,

not to maintain old fables that are now discredited, but
to revitalize the true penal sanction under forms that
correspond to your customs, your sentiments and the
enlightenment of your era.
“Who in fact are the guilty? Those who through a
transgression, through a wrong impulse of the soul have
distanced themselves from the objective of their creation,
which consists in the desire for goodness and beauty as
idealized by the human embodiment of perfection, the

“What is punishment? It is the natural consequence of that
wrong impulse, the amount of pain necessary for the guilty
through the trials of suffering due to their transgression.
Punishment is the goad that arouses the soul through its
affliction to turn toward itself, to return to the path of
salvation. The objective of punishment is none other than
rehabilitation and redemption. Wanting punishment to
be eternal for a wrong which is not eternal is to deprive it
of its reason to exist.
“Truly I say to you, stop comparing eternity in terms of
the good, which is the essence of the Creator, with evil,
which is the essence of the creature – an approach that
ends up creating unjustifiable penalties. Rather, affirm the
gradual diminution of punishments and penalties through
successive reincarnations and you will consecrate divine
unity through reason and sentiment.”
                                                Paul, The Apostle

 Humans are stimulated to morality and turned from evil by the
 lure of reward and the fear of punishment, but if such punishment
 is represented in a way that defies reason, it will yield no influence.

Rather, it will be rejected in its totality – form and foundation.
However, if the future is presented under a logical form, it will not
be rejected. Spiritism provides such an explanation.
The doctrine of eternal punishment in its absolute sense makes the
Supreme Being an implacable God. Would it be logical to say that a
king is very good, very benevolent and very indulgent, that he only
wants the happiness of all around him, but that he is at the same
time jealous, vindictive, inflexibly severe and that he punishes three-
quarters of his subjects with the maximum penalty for any offense
or infraction of his laws, even when they have broken them without
having been aware of them? Wouldn’t that be a contradiction? How
could God be less than what a human would be?
Another contradiction is presented in this case. Since God knows
everything, then God knew while creating a soul that it would fail,
that from its formation it was destined to eternal unhappiness. Is
this possible? Is it rational? With the doctrine of relative punishment
everything is set aright. God undoubtedly knew that the soul would
fail, but gave it the means of enlightening itself through its own
experience and through its own errors. It would have to expiate
such errors in order to establish itself in the good, but the door
of hope would never be closed against it. God made the moment
of its liberation depend on the efforts it makes to attain it. This is
something that all can understand and the most meticulous logic
can accept. If future punishment had been presented in this way,
there would be a lot fewer skeptics.
The word eternal is almost always employed figuratively in common
language to designate something of a long period of duration, of
which the end is not foreseen, although it is very well known that
there will in fact be an end. We speak of the eternal snows of the
high mountains and the poles, for instance, although we know,
on the one hand, that the physical world could come to an end,
and on the other hand, that the state of those regions could be
modified by a shift in the earth’s axis or some other cataclysm. The
word eternal, in this case, does not mean infinite duration. When
we suffer some long-term illness we say that it is eternal. So why
wonder when spirits who have suffered for many years, centuries,


                           550

                              Future Joys and Sorrows


            and even thousands of years speak of it as being eternal? Above all,
            we must not forget that their imperfection does not allow them to
            see the end of their afflictions; they believe they will suffer forever,
            which is in itself a punishment for them.
            Furthermore, the doctrine of physical fire, of furnaces, and tortures
            borrowed from the Tartarus60 of paganism has been completely
            abandoned nowadays by liberal theology. Only in certain schools
            are such terrifying allegorical images still presented as literal truths
            by some individuals who are more fanatical than enlightened. This
            is all very wrong, because young imaginations, once past the terror,
            will most likely become skeptical. Today, theology recognizes that
            the word fire is employed figuratively and should be understood as
            mental suffering (see no.974). Those who, like us, have followed
            the incidents of the life and sufferings beyond the grave through
            Spiritist communications have been convinced that though not
            physical, they are no less poignant. Even regarding their duration,
            some theologians are beginning to accept the restrictive meaning
            indicated above, and in fact, they think that the word eternal could
            refer to the penalties per se, as the consequence of an immutable
            law, and not to its application to each individual. On the day when
            religion accepts such an interpretation, as well as others that are also
            the consequence of the progress of enlightenment, it will bring back
            many lost sheep into its fold.



              The Resurrection of the Flesh
1010. Is the doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh a reference to
      reincarnation as taught by the Spirits?
          “How could it be otherwise? This expression is similar
          to so many others that only appear to be nonsensical to
          those who take them literally and are driven to disbelief.
          However, give it a logical interpretation, and those whom

        you call freethinkers will accept it without difficulty
        precisely because they are able to rationalize it. Make no
        mistake, such freethinkers want nothing more than to
        believe; like everyone else – perhaps even more so – they
        long for the future, but they cannot accept what is absurd
        to reason. The doctrine of the plurality of existences
        conforms to the justice of God and it alone can explain
        what is otherwise inexplicable. Why do you wonder that
        this principle is found in religion itself?”
1011. Then in the dogma of the resurrection of the flesh, does the
      Church teach the doctrine of reincarnation?
        “That is obvious. This doctrine is the consequence of many
        things which have gone unnoticed and which will soon be
        properly understood. Before long, the Church will realize
        that Spiritism relates at every step to the very text of the
        Holy Scriptures. Therefore, the Spirits have not come to
        subvert Christianity, as some claim; on the contrary, they
        have come to confirm and sanction it through irrefutable
        proofs. And since the time has arrived to replace figurative
        language, they speak without allegories and give things a
        clear and precise meaning that cannot be the object of any
        wrong interpretation. That is why it is simply a matter
        of time before there will be more sincerely religious and
        believing persons than there are today.”
                                                               St. Louis

         Science has demonstrated the impossibility of resurrection
         according to the common idea. If the remains of the human
         body actually remained homogeneous, even though dispersed
         and reduced to dust, we might conceive of their being reunited at
         some determined time. Such is not the case, however. The body is
         composed of diverse elements: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon,
         etc. Through decomposition, these elements are dispersed and will


                                 552

                         Future Joys and Sorrows


         serve to form new bodies in such a way that the same molecule
         of carbon, for example, will have entered into the composition
         of many thousands of different bodies (we are only speaking of
         human bodies, leaving out those of animals). Consequently, an
         individual may have in his or her body molecules that belonged
         to humans of earlier times. The same organic molecules that you
         absorb from your food, for instance, may have come from the
         body of an individual whom you have known. Since matter has
         a definite quantity and since its transformations are indefinite in
         number, how could each one of those bodies be reconstituted
         with the same elements? This implies a material impossibility. The
         resurrection of the flesh cannot, therefore, be rationally accepted
         except as a figure of speech symbolizing the phenomenon of
         reincarnation, and as such, there is nothing shocking to reason;
         nothing that may be contrary to the data of science.
         It is true that according to dogma the resurrection will only occur
         at the end of time, while according to the Spiritist Doctrine it
         occurs everyday. Doesn’t the image of the final judgment carry a
         great and beautiful metaphor, which, behind the veil of allegory,
         hides one of those immutable truths that the skeptics will no longer
         reject once its true meaning comes to light? Meditate well on
         the Spiritist explanation concerning the future of souls and their
         destiny that results from the many trials they must undergo, and it
         will be apparent that with the exception of it being simultaneous,
         the judgment in which their sins are condemned or absolved is
         not a fiction, as disbelievers think it is. Let us further consider that
         this theory is the natural consequence of the plurality of worlds –
         nowadays perfectly accepted – whereas according to the doctrine of
         the final judgment, the earth is the only inhabited world.



            Heaven, Hell and Purgatory
1012. Are there circumscribed places in the universe that are
      intended for the punishments and pleasures of spirits
      according to their merits?


                                    553

                          Part Four – Chapter II


        “We have already responded to this question. Punishments
        and joys are inherent to the degree of a spirit’s
        perfection. Each spirit carries within itself the source of
        its own happiness or unhappiness, and since spirits are
        everywhere, there is no circumscribed or enclosed place
        for one or the other. As for incarnate spirits, the degree of
        their happiness or unhappiness depends on the evolution
        of the world they inhabit.”
        – Accordingly, would heaven and hell not exist as humans
        have represented them?
        “They are no more than figures of speech – happy and
        unhappy spirits are everywhere. Nevertheless, as we have
        also told you, spirits of the same order gather together
        through their mutual sympathy. When perfect, they can
        meet wherever they desire.”
         The idea of fixed places of reward and punishment exists only in
         people’s imaginations. It proceeds from their tendency to materialize
         and circumscribe the things whose infinite nature they cannot
         comprehend.

1013. What is to be understood by “purgatory”?
        “Physical and mental suffering; it is a period of expiation.
        It is almost always on the earth that you make your own
        purgatory, and that is where God enables you to expiate
        your wrongs.”
         What is called purgatory is also a figure of speech that should not be
         understood as some definite place, but rather the state of imperfect
         spirits who are in expiation until their complete purification raises
         them to the plane of the blissful spirits. Since this purification
         occurs over several incarnations, purgatory consists in the trials of
         corporeal life.

1014. How do you explain the fact that spirits who are known to be


                                   554

                       Future Joys and Sorrows


       highly evolved because of the language they use have given to
       serious individuals answers on hell and purgatory that are in
       line with commonly accepted ideas?
       “They speak a language that can be understood by the
       individuals who question them. When such individuals
       are highly imbued with certain ideas, these spirits do not
       want to shock them too suddenly in order not to harm
       their convictions. If a spirit were to forget about verbal
       precautions and to say to a Muslim that Mohammed was
       not a prophet, it would be very poorly received.”
       – We can understand this on the part of spirits who wish
       to instruct us, but how may it be explained that, when
       questioned about their situation, spirits have responded that
       they were suffering the tortures of hell or purgatory?
       “When they are of a low order and are not completely
       dematerialized, spirits retain a portion of their earthly
       ideas and translate their impressions using terms that are
       familiar to them. They find themselves in surroundings
       that do not permit them to probe the future except in a
       deficient way. This is the reason why errant or recently
       discarnated spirits usually speak just as they would have if
       they were still incarnate. Hell may be translated as meaning
       a life of extremely painful trials with the uncertainty that it
       will ever end. Purgatory is also a life of trials, but with the
       awareness of a better future. Whenever you are suffering a
       great deal of pain, don’t you say that you are suffering like
       hell? These are also nothing more than words uttered as a
       figure of speech.”
1015. What should be understood by a tormented soul?
       “An errant and suffering soul, uncertain about its future, and
       to whom you can provide the solace it frequently begs for


                                555

                           Part Four – Chapter II


        when it comes to communicate with you.” (See no. 664.)
1016. In what sense should the word heaven be understood?
        “Do you believe that it is a place like the Elysian Fields
        of the ancients, where all the good spirits are confusedly
        crowded together with no other concern than that of
        enjoying an eternity of passive bliss? No. It is universal
        space – the planets, the stars and all the highly evolved
        worlds on which spirits enjoy all their faculties without
        the tribulations of material life or the anguish inherent to
        less evolved stages.”
1017. Some spirits have said that they inhabit the fourth, the fifth
      heaven, etc. What is meant by this?
        “You asked them which heaven they inhabit because you
        have the idea of many superimposed heavens resembling
        the stories of a house; thus, they merely responded
        according to your own language. However, for them, the
        words fourth or fifth heaven express different degrees of
        purification, and consequently, of happiness. It is the same
        when a spirit is asked if it is in hell. If it is unhappy, it will
        say yes, because for it hell is synonymous with suffering,
        although it knows very well that it is not a furnace. A
        pagan spirit would respond that it is in Tartarus.”
          The same applies to other analogous expressions, such as the city
          of flowers, the city of the elect, the first, second or third sphere,
          etc., which are no more than allegories employed by certain spirits,
          whether as figures of speech, whether from ignorance of the reality of
          things or whether from ignorance of the simplest scientific concepts.
          According to the former narrow idea of fixed places of punishment
          and reward, and especially according to the opinion that the earth
          was the center of the universe, and that the sky formed a vault in
          which there was a region of stars, heaven was placed up above and
          hell down below; hence the expressions to ascend into heaven, to be


                                    556

                          Future Joys and Sorrows


          in highest heaven, to be cast down into hell, etc. Now that science has
          demonstrated that the earth is no more than one of the smallest
          worlds among so many millions of others, which gives it no special
          importance; that it has traced the earth’s formation and described
          its constitution; that it has proven that space is infinite in such a
          way that there is neither up nor down in the universe, it has become
          necessary to reject placing heaven above the clouds and hell in the
          lower regions. As for purgatory, no fixed place has ever been assigned
          to it. Concerning such matters, it was reserved for Spiritism to give
          the most rational, fundamental, and at the same time, the most
          consoling explanation to humankind. Thus, we can say that we
          carry our hell and our heaven within ourselves, and that we find
          our purgatory in our incarnation, in our corporeal or physical lives.

1018. In what sense should we understand the words of Christ, “My
      kingdom is not of this world?”
        “Christ was responding figuratively. He wanted to say
        that he only reigned over pure and unselfish hearts. He
        is in every place where love and goodness rule; however,
        humans, greedy for the things of this world, are attached
        to the things of earth and not to him.”
1019. Will the kingdom of the good ever be realized on earth?
        “The good will reign on earth when, among the spirits who
        come to inhabit it, the good outnumber the evil ones. They
        will then enable love and justice – the source of goodness
        and of happiness – to reign on earth. It is through moral
        progress and the practice of the laws of God that humans
        will attract good spirits to the earth and repel the evil ones.
        However, the evil ones will only leave after humans have
        banished pride and selfishness from the planet.
        “The transformation of humankind has been predicted,
        and the time has come for all progressive individuals to
        hasten it. It will be implemented through the incarnation


                                     557

                Part Four – Chapter II


of more-evolved spirits, who will comprise a new
generation on the earth. Then the spirits of evil, who
are reaped daily by death, and all those who try to deter
the forward advancement of things will be excluded, for
they will be out of place among humans of high morality,
whose happiness they would disturb. They will go to
newer, less-advanced worlds to fulfill pain-filled missions,
where they will be able to labor for their own progress and
at the same time labor for the progress of their brothers
and sisters who are even less advanced. Don’t you see in
such an exclusion from a transformed earth the sublime
image of Paradise Lost? Also, don’t you see in the humans
who have come to the earth under similar conditions,
bringing within themselves the seeds of their passions and
the traces of their primitive inferiority, the no-less sublime
image of original sin? Considered in this way, original sin
refers to the still imperfect nature of humans, who are only
responsible for themselves and for their own wrongs, and
not for those of their parents.
“All of you, men and women of faith and goodwill, work
therefore with zeal and courage for the great work of
regeneration, for you will reap a hundredfold the grain of
wheat that you have sown. Unfortunate are those who close
their eyes to the light, for they are preparing long centuries
of darkness and sorrow for themselves! Unfortunate are
those who place all their joys in the things of this world,
for they will suffer more privations than the pleasures they
have had. And above all, unfortunate are the selfish, for
they will not find anyone to help them bear the burden of
their miseries.”

       Those who know only magnetism by the little magnetized
toy ducks that are made to swim around in a basin of water would
find it difficult to understand that this little amusement contains
the secret of the mechanism of the universe and of the movement
of worlds. The same applies to those who only know Spiritism by
the entertainment of table-turning.61 They see it as no more than
an amusement, a pastime at social gatherings, and they do not
understand how such a simple and common phenomenon, known
to antiquity and even to semi­-primitive cultures, could be connected
in any way with the most serious problems of the social order. In fact,
to the superficial observer, what connection could a turning table
have with the morality and future of humankind? And yet, whoever
would take the time to reflect will remember that from a simple
pot whose lid is lifted by steam – an event that has also occurred
since antiquity – emerged the powerful steam engine we use in
order to cross space and go great distances. So, likewise, all of you

an entire science has emerged, as well as the solutions to problems
that no philosophy has ever been able to solve. I appeal to all sincere
adversaries and ask them to state whether they have done the work
of studying what they criticize, because criticism is only valuable
when the critic understands the subject. By ridiculing something
that we know nothing about, something that we have not probed
with the scalpel of the conscientious observer, we are not criticizing
but instead are proving our shallowness and poor judgment ability.
Of course, if we had presented this philosophy as being the work of
the human mind, it would have encountered less disdain and would
have merited the honor of being examined by those who think they
guide public opinion. But it has come from the Spirits! How absurd!
It hardly deserves a glance. They judge it merely by its label, like
the monkey in the fable, who judged the nut by its shell. If you
wish, set aside this book’s origin and imagine that it is the work of
a human individual. After having read it seriously, ask your soul and
conscience whether you have found material deserving of mockery.

        Spiritism is the most dreaded antagonist of materialism; thus,
it is not surprising that materialists are its adversaries. However, since
materialism is a doctrine that is barely accepted by its own proponents
(further proof that they do not regard themselves sufficiently strong
and that they have not completely taken leave of their conscience),
they cover themselves with the mantle of reason and science. And
what is even more bizarre is that the most skeptical go so far as to talk
in the name of religion, which they also do not know or understand
any better than Spiritism. Their target is particularly the extraordinary
and the supernatural – they reject both. Their argument is that since
Spiritism is founded on the extraordinary, it can be nothing more than
foolish speculation. They do not seem to realize that by rejecting the


                                   560

                                Conclusion


extraordinary and the supernatural, they also reject religion, which
is founded on revelation and miracles. And what is revelation but
extra-human communications? All the sacred authors since Moses
have spoken of such communications. And what are miracles except
extraordinary and supernatural events par excellence since in their
theological definition they are derogations from the laws of nature?
The fact is that in rejecting the extraordinary and the supernatural,
they reject the very bases of religion itself. However, it is not from this
aspect that we wish to consider the subject. Spiritism does not have
to examine whether or not there are miracles; that is, whether God
can in certain cases break the eternal laws that govern the universe. In
that respect it leaves everything to freedom of belief. On the contrary,
Spiritism states and shows that the phenomena on which it is based
are only supernatural in appearance. To certain individuals, such
phenomena do not appear natural, because they are unusual and outside
the orbit of known events. However, they are no more supernatural
than all the other phenomena for which today’s science is providing
an explanation, and which appeared extraordinary in earlier times. All
spirit phenomena, without exception, are consequences of general laws.
They have revealed to us one of the forces of nature, an unknown force,
or rather one that has not been understood until today, but one that
observation has shown to be in the overall scheme of things. Spiritism,
therefore, lies less on the extraordinary and supernatural than religion
itself does. Those who attack it at this point do not comprehend it,
and even if they were highly learned, we would still say to them: if your
science, which has taught you so many things, has not shown you that

      You have stated that you would like to cure your century of
a craze that threatens to invade the world. Would you rather the

world be invaded by the disbelief you seek to propagate? Is it not to
the absence of belief that we ought to attribute the relaxing of family
ties and the majority of the disorders that are controlling society? By
demonstrating the existence and immortality of the soul, Spiritism
revives faith in the future, uplifts discouraged hearts and enables
us to bear the tribulations of life with resignation. Would you dare
call this an evil? Two doctrines confront each other: one denies the
future; the other proclaims and proves it. One explains nothing; the
other explains everything, and in doing so it appeals to reason. One
sanctions selfishness; the other offers a basis for justice, charity, and
the love of one’s neighbor. The former affirms only the present and
erases all hope; the latter consoles and shows the vast field of the
future. Which of the two is the more pernicious?
        Certain individuals – among the most skeptical – present
themselves as apostles of fraternity and progress. However, true
fraternity implies selflessness and the renunciation of self-centeredness.
The sentiment of pride is an anomaly to true fraternity. By what right
do you impose a sacrifice on those to whom you state that at death
everything will be over for them, and that perhaps tomorrow they
will be nothing more than an old worn-out and discarded machine?
What reason would they have to impose any privation on themselves?
Is it not more natural that in the few moments granted to them they
would try to live as well as possible? This gives rise to the desire to
possess more and more in order to enjoy life better. It also gives birth
to jealousy of those who possess even more, and from such jealousy
to the desire to rob and steal there is only a single step. What is there
to prevent this? The law? Unfortunately, the law does not cover all
cases. Would you say it is conscience, a sense of duty? But upon what
do you base this sense of duty? Can its reason for existing be found
in the belief that everything ends with life? According to this belief,
only one maxim is rational: “Every man for himself.” The ideas of
fraternity, conscience, duty, humanity and progress are no more than


                                   562

empty words. You, who proclaim similar doctrines, you do not know
all the evil you cause society, or how many crimes you are responsible
for! But why do I speak of responsibility at all? There is no such thing
for skeptics; they only render homage to matter.

                                   IV

        The progress of humankind has as its principle the practical
application of the law of justice, love and charity, and this law is
founded on the certainty of the future. Take away that certainty and
you take away its cornerstone. All others are derived from this law
because it entails all the conditions of human happiness. It alone can
heal the afflictions of society, and we can judge this by comparing
various eras and peoples, since their conditions improve as this law
is better understood and better applied. In addition, if a partial and
incomplete application has produced such a real benefit, what would
happen if all social institutions were to take it as their basis? Could
that be possible? Yes. Those who have advanced ten steps can advance
twenty, and so on. We can evaluate the future based on the past. We
are already seeing that the hostilities among peoples are decreasing
little by little; that the barriers separating them fall as they become
civilized; that they are joining hands from one end of the world to
the other; that more justice is presiding over international laws; that
wars are becoming rarer and no longer exclude humane sentiments;
that uniformity is being established in relationships; that race and
caste distinctions are disappearing and people of different beliefs
are silencing their sectarian prejudices so that they may unite in the
worship of one and the same God. We are speaking of the peoples
that are at the forefront of civilization (see nos. 789-793). From every
aspect, however, we are still far from perfection, and there is still much
old residue to destroy before the last vestiges of barbarity disappear.
But will those vestiges be able to withstand the irresistible power of


                                   563

                               Conclusion


progress and that living force which in itself is a law of nature? If the
present generation is more advanced than the last, why should the
next not be more advanced than ours? It will in fact be so through the
force of things: first, because with each generation, a few champions
of the old abuses die out every day, and thus society is increasingly
composed of new members who are free of the old prejudices; second,
because humans desire progress, they study the obstacles and employ
their efforts to overcome them – evolution is incontestable and future
progress cannot be put in doubt. People by nature desire to be happy
and they only seek progress to increase their happiness; apart from
happiness, progress would have no objective. What would be the value
of progress for them if the goal was not to improve their conditions?
Even so, after having attained the happiness that intellectual progress
can offer them, they will perceive that such happiness is not complete.
They will realize that such happiness is impossible without the security
and harmony in social relationships that can be found only in moral
progress. Thus, by the force of circumstances, they themselves will
drive progress along the path of morality, and Spiritism will offer them
the most powerful means for reaching the goal.

                                   V

       Those who state that Spiritist beliefs are threatening to
invade the world thereby proclaim its power, for an idea without
foundation and lacking in logic could not become universal. If
Spiritism is putting down roots everywhere, recruiting especially
from the enlightened classes – as has been widely acknowledged – it
is because it is founded upon truth. All the efforts of its detractors
will be useless, proving that, far from deterring its impulse, the very
ridicule which they have sought to heap upon it seems to have given
it new vigor. This result fully justifies what the Spirits have stated:
“Do not allow yourselves to be disquieted by opposition. Everything


                                  564

                                Conclusion


they do against you will turn to your advantage, and your greatest
adversaries will serve your cause, in spite of themselves. Against the will
of God, the ill-will of human beings shall not prevail.”
        With Spiritism, humankind must enter a new phase: moral
progress, which is Spiritism’s inevitable consequence. So stop
wondering at the speed at which Spiritist ideas are spreading due to
the satisfaction they provide to all those who delve into them, and
who see in them something more than a wasteful pastime. Since
men and women desire happiness above everything else, it is no
wonder they become interested in an idea that makes them happy.
        The development of these ideas presents three distinct
periods: the first is that of curiosity aroused by the strangeness of
the phenomena; the second is that of reasoning and philosophy; the
third is that of application and consequences. The period of curiosity
has already passed. Contrary to what serious thought or reason infer,
curiosity only lasts for a certain amount of time, and once satisfied
it passes on to something new. But the same does not occur with
what is referred to as serious thought or reason. The second period
has already begun and the third will certainly follow. Spiritism has
especially progressed since it has become better understood in its
essential nature, and its reach has been acknowledged to touch the
most sensitive fiber of humankind: happiness, even in this world.
This is the cause of its spread, the secret of the power that is enabling
it to triumph. Its influence has not yet extended over the masses, but
it has already rendered happy those who have come to understand it.
Even those who have not witnessed any of the physical phenomena
of the manifestations will state, “Apart from the phenomena, Spiritist
philosophy explains to me what no other has ever explained. Through
simple reasoning, I find in it a rational explanation of the problems
that interest me the most – those of my future. It provides me with
peace, security and confidence. It frees me from the torments of
uncertainty, rendering the material aspects of life secondary.” As for


                                   565

                               Conclusion


those who assail Spiritism, I respond: Would you like to fight against
it successfully? If so, simply replace it with something better. Find a
more philosophical solution to all the problems it resolves. Give people
another certainty that will render them happier. However, you must
thoroughly understand the reach of that word certainty, because people
only accept as certain what appears to be logical. Do not think it is
enough to state that something does not exist – denying something is
too easy. Go beyond simple denial and prove through solid facts that
it is not viable, never has been and never can be. And in such a case,
state clearly what you would put in its place. Furthermore, prove that
Spiritism has not rendered humans better and therefore happier by
encouraging the purest Gospel-oriented morality, a morality that is
very much praised but very little practiced. When you have done all
this, you will have a right to assail it. Spiritism is powerful because it
is supported on the very bases of religion itself – God, the soul, future
rewards and punishments – and especially because it shows such
rewards and punishments to be the natural consequences of earthly
life. The picture it paints of the future contains nothing that can
be contested by the most demanding reason. You, whose doctrine
consists entirely in denying the future, what compensation do you
offer for the suffering found in this world? You uphold yourselves
on disbelief, whereas Spiritism supports itself on trust in God. It
invites everyone to happiness, to hope, to true fraternity, whereas you
offer them nothingness as a prospect and selfishness as a consolation.
Spiritism explains everything; you explain nothing. It proves by
facts; you prove nothing. Why would you expect people to hesitate
between these two doctrines?

                                   VI

       It would be quite erroneous to believe that the power of
Spiritism derives from the practice of material manifestations,


                                   566

                               Conclusion


and that therefore by hampering them one could undermine its
foundations. However, its power is in its philosophy, in the appeal it
makes to reason and common sense. In antiquity, it was the object of
mysterious study, carefully hidden from the common folk. Today, it
holds no secrets from anyone and it speaks a clear language without
ambiguity. There is neither mysticism in it nor any allegories prone
to erroneous interpretation. It wishes to be understood by all because
the time has come to enable humankind to know the truth. Far from
opposing the diffusion of the light, it desires light for all. It does not
demand blind faith but wants everyone to know why they believe,
and since it is based on reason, it will always be more powerful than
doctrines based on nothingness. Could the obstacles that have been
set up against the free expression of spirit manifestations silence them?
No, such obstacles would have the effect of all other prohibitions:
that of exciting curiosity and the desire to investigate what is being
prohibited. On the other hand, if spirit manifestations were the
personal privilege of only a single individual, no one would doubt
that if that individual were out of the way, the manifestations would
cease. Unfortunately for our adversaries, the manifestations are within
everybody’s reach and are being utilized by all, from the least to the
greatest, from the palace to the hovel. It might be possible to prevent
them from being produced in public, but it is well known that they
are more effectively produced not in public but in private. In addition,
since all persons are mediums in one way or another, how would it be
possible to prevent family members in their own home, individuals
in the silence of their bedroom, or prisoners in their cell and in the
presence of their executioners from having communications with the
spirits around them? If mediums were forbidden in one country, could
they be hindered in neighboring countries or in the entire world since
there is not a single region in the two halves of the world in which
there are no mediums? In order to imprison all the mediums, it would
be necessary to detain half the human race. If it were possible to burn


                                   567

                                Conclusion


all the Spiritist books – not an easy task – they would be reproduced
the next day because their source cannot be stricken, and because one
could never imprison or burn the Spirits, their true authors.
        Spiritism is not the work of any one individual. No one can
claim to be its author, for it is as old as creation itself. It is found
everywhere, in all religions, especially in Catholicism, where, in
actuality, it has more authority than in all the others. Catholicism
contains the principles of all the manifestations: spirits of every
degree, their secret or patent relationships with humankind,
guardian angels, reincarnation, the emancipation of the soul during
life, second sight, visions, manifestations of every kind, and even
tangible apparitions. As for depictions of demons, they are no more
than evil spirits, and except for the belief that demons have turned
to wickedness forever – whereas evil spirits have the path of progress
open before them – there is no other difference but the name.
        So what does modern Spiritist science do? It joins into a whole
what has been scattered. It explains in its own terms what has only
been known in allegorical language and it eliminates everything
that superstition and ignorance have created, leaving only what is
real and positive – this is its role. But the role of founder does not
belong to it. It reveals what already exists; it coordinates, but creates
nothing, for its foundations may be found in all ages and places.
Who would thus dare feel strong enough to stifle it by sarcasm or
even by persecution? If it were proscribed in one place, it would
reappear in others exactly as it had been when it was banned because
it exists in nature itself and humans have not been given the ability
to obliterate a power of nature or veto the decrees of God.
        Furthermore, what interest would there be in hampering the
publication of Spiritist ideas? It is true that such ideas have arisen
against the abuses that spring from pride and selfishness, but these
abuses, which are profitable to some, injure the masses. Spiritism will
therefore have the masses on its side, and will have no serious adversaries


                                   568

                              Conclusion


except those interested in maintaining such abuses. Instead, under its
influence, its ideas will render people better toward one another, less
avid about material interests and more resigned before the decrees of
Providence, thus guaranteeing order and tranquility.

                                 VII

        Spiritism is presented under three different aspects: the
manifestations, the philosophical and moral principles deduced from
the manifestations, and the practical applications of those principles.
Hence, there are three classes or three degrees of its adherents:
first, those who believe in the manifestations and limit themselves
to proving them – it is for them a science of experimentation;
second, those who comprehend its moral consequences; third, those
who practice or endeavor to practice its morality. Whatever may
be the scientific or moral point of view from which these strange
phenomena are regarded, everyone perceives that they represent a
new order of ideas, whose consequences will promote a profound
modification for the better in the state of humankind.
        As for our adversaries, we may also group them into three
categories. In the first are those who systematically deny everything
new or anything that does not proceed from their own minds,
and who address the issue without knowing its cause. To this class
belong all those who admit nothing beyond the testimony of their
senses. They have seen nothing and want to see nothing – even less
to delve into anything. They would even become troubled if they
saw things too clearly, afraid of being forced to confess that they
have been wrong. For them, Spiritism is a fantasy, an insanity, a
utopia – it has no real existence, and that is the end of the matter.
These are the unbending disbelievers. At their side are those who
have only condescended to glance at the subject long enough to
ease their conscience in order to be able to say: I wanted to see, but


                                 569

                               Conclusion


have seen nothing. They do not understand that it might require
more than half an hour to take in an entire science.
       In the second category are those who know very well what to
think of the reality of the phenomena but they nevertheless oppose
them for reasons of personal interest. They know that Spiritism is
authentic, but they fear its consequences and attack it as an enemy.
In the third category are those who find in Spiritist morals a censure
that is too severe for their behavior and inclinations. If they were to
take Spiritism seriously, it would inconvenience them. They neither
reject nor accept it, but prefer to shut their eyes to it. The first are
swayed by pride and presumption; the second, by ambition and the
third, by selfishness. Of course, since these causes of opposition lack
consistency, they must disappear with time. We would seek in vain
for a fourth class of antagonists, who would base their opposition
on evidence that would demonstrate a conscientious and detailed
study of the issue. People have discounted Spiritism but no one has
presented a serious and irrefutable demonstration to the contrary.
       It would be presuming too much of human nature to believe
that it could suddenly be transformed by Spiritist ideas. Acting on
these ideas will certainly differ in degree of intensity among those
who profess them. Whatever their results may be – even if weak –
they will nevertheless represent an improvement. If nothing else,
they would provide proof of the existence of an extra-corporeal
world, which in itself would negate materialist doctrines. This is
the result of a simple observation of the phenomena, but among
those who comprehend the Spiritist philosophy and see in it
something more than the more or less curious phenomena, there
are other effects. The first and most general is that of developing a
religious sentiment, even in those who without being materialists
are indifferent to spiritual things. For them, this will result in a loss
of the fear of death. We are not saying they will desire death – far
from it – for Spiritists will defend their lives like anyone else, but


                                  570

                                Conclusion


they will feel indifferent about it, which will enable them to accept
inevitable death without complaint or regret and be assured that a
happier state will ensue. The second effect, perhaps as general as the
first, is resignation in the face of life’s afflictions. Spiritism enables us
to see things from such a height that earthly life loses three fourths
of its importance and we are no longer disturbed by its tribulations.
Hence, we have more courage in our troubles and more moderation
in our desires. We also have an aversion to the desire to shorten our
own life, for Spiritist knowledge teaches that suicide always causes
the loss of what it was intended to gain. The certainty of a future
where happiness depends on ourselves, along with the possibility
of establishing relationships with those who are dear to us, provide
supreme consolation to our spirit. Our horizons are widened to
infinity by our constant vision of the life beyond the grave, a life
whose deepest mysteries we are allowed to probe. The third effect
is that of awakening tolerance for others’ shortcomings. It must be
admitted, however, that selfishness and everything that issues from it
are the most tenacious sentiments in humans, and consequently the
most difficult to uproot. We can make voluntary sacrifices provided
they cost us nothing, and especially provided they deprive us of
nothing. Money still exerts an irresistible attraction on the majority
of humankind, and very few understand the word superfluous in
connection with their own selves. Thus, the renunciation of the self
is the most eminent sign of progress.

                                   VIII

      Some people have asked: Do spirits teach us a new morality,
something superior to what Christ taught? And if this morality is
none other than that of the Gospel, what has Spiritism come to
do? This reasoning is strangely familiar to that of Caliph Omar in
speaking of the Library of Alexandria: “If it contains only what is


                                    571

                              Conclusion


found in the Koran, it is useless and should therefore be burned; if
it contains anything else, it is evil and should be burned.” Indeed,
Spiritism does not contain a different morality than that of Jesus, but
we must in turn ask: Hadn’t the law of God already been revealed by
Moses to humans before the advent of Christ? Isn’t Christ’s doctrine
found in the Decalogue? And will it therefore be stated that Jesus
had no reason to give his moral teachings? We will ask those who
deny the usefulness of Spiritist morality why Christ’s morality is
practiced so little, and why even those who proclaim its sublimity
are the first to violate the first of his laws: universal charity. The
Spirits have come not only to confirm Christ’s morality, but also to
show us its practical usefulness. They render intelligible and patent
certain truths that have only been taught under allegorical form, and
alongside morality the Spirits have come to define for us the most
abstract problems of psychology.
       Jesus came to show humankind the road of true goodness.
Since God sent him to remind humans of God’s forgotten law, why
would God not send the Spirits to remind them more precisely,
now that they have forgotten it for the sake of pride and cupidity?
Who would dare to place limits on God’s power or to stipulate
the divine ways? Who will say that the appointed time has not
arrived – as the Spirits have affirmed – and that the days have not
arrived in which truths badly comprehended or falsely interpreted
must be ostensibly revealed to humankind to accelerate their
advancement? Is there not something providential in the spirit
manifestations being produced simultaneously all over the globe?
It is not a single individual, a prophet who has come to warn us;
instead, the light is shining far and wide and a whole new world is
unfolding before our eyes. Just as the invention of the microscope
has revealed the unsuspected world of the infinitely small, and
as the telescope has revealed the myriads of unsuspected worlds,
spirit communications have revealed the existence of an invisible


                                 572

                              Conclusion


world surrounding us, whose inhabitants rub elbows with us at
every moment, participating in everything we do despite our will.
Yet, in a short time, the existence of that world that surely awaits
all of us will be as incontestable as the microscopic world and the
great globes lost in space. Would it not have been to our advantage
therefore to have been given notice of this world and to have been
initiated into the mysteries of the life beyond the grave? It is true
that these discoveries – if we may call them such – are contrary
to certain established ideas. However, is it not true that all great
scientific discoveries have also modified and even overthrown the
most established concepts? Has it not been necessary for our self-
centeredness to bow down before the evidence? The same will
occur with Spiritism, and soon it will have the rights of citizenship
among the rest of the areas of human knowledge.
       Communications with the beings beyond the grave have
enabled us, as a result, to comprehend and behold our future life, and
to initiate us into the sorrows and joys that await us according to our
merits. They have led persons to spiritualism, persons who did not see
in human beings anything more than matter, anything more than an
organized machine. Hence, we are correct in stating that Spiritism has
killed materialism because of these communications. Had it produced
nothing else, the social order would still have to be grateful for that.
But it does even more by showing the inevitable consequences of
evil, and consequently, the necessity of the good. The number of
those in whom it has aroused better sentiments, neutralizing their
evil inclinations and turning them from wrongdoing, is greater
than supposed and is increasing every day. For them, the future is
no longer a vague idea, nor a simple hope, but a reality that can be
comprehended and explained once they see and hear those who have
gone before us as they lament or rejoice over what they did on earth.
Those who witness these communications are led to reflect on them
and to feel the need to know, judge and amend themselves.


                                  573

                                Conclusion


                                    IX

        The adversaries of Spiritism were quick to arm themselves
against it by using some differences of opinion concerning certain
points of the Doctrine. It is not surprising that at the beginning of any
science contradictory theories appear that are based on incomplete
observations while each individual is still considering it from his or
her own point of view. However, three fourths of such theories with
regard to Spiritism have already been scuttled in the light of more
in-depth studies, beginning with the theory that attributes all spirit
communications to the Spirit of Evil, as if it were impossible for
God to send good spirits to humankind instead. Such is an absurd
doctrine because it is belied by the facts, and is impious because it
is a denial of the power and goodness of the Creator. The Spirits
have always advised us not to trouble ourselves with differences of
opinion since unity will occur and has already occurred concerning
the majority of the issues, whereas differences are disappearing day
by day. To the question: While awaiting unity, upon what basis can
an impartial and disinterested inquirer formulate a judgment? The
Spirits have given us this response:
       “The purest light is not eclipsed by any cloud; the flawless
diamond is the one of greatest value, so judge the Spirits by the purity
of their teachings. Do not forget that among spirits there are those
who have not yet freed themselves from the ideas of earthly life. Learn
to distinguish them by their language; judge them by the sum of what
they tell you; see whether there is logical sequence in their ideas, and
whether there is anything in what they say that reveals ignorance,
pride or malevolence; in other words, whether their expressions are
always marked with the stamp of wisdom that reveals true superiority.
If your world were inaccessible to error, it would be perfect, but it is far
from perfection because you are still learning to distinguish error from
truth. You need the lessons of experience to exercise your judgment


                                    574

                              Conclusion


and to enable you to evolve. Unity will be found on the side where
good has never been mixed with evil. It is on that side that people will
be connected with one another through the force of circumstances,
for they will realize that the truth lies there.
       “Besides, what do a few variances that are more a matter of
form than depth matter? Observe that the fundamental principles
of Spiritism are the same everywhere, and must unite you all in a
common thought: the love of God and the practice of the good.
Therefore, no matter what may be the mode of progression that
is accepted or the normal conditions of your future existence, the
final aim is always the same: doing good, and as you know, there
are not two ways of doing it.”
       If among the followers of Spiritism there are those who
differ in their opinions about some points of its theory, all of them
are nevertheless in agreement on the fundamental points. Thus,
there is unity, except on the part of a very small number who do
not yet accept the intervention of spirits in the manifestations,
either attributing them to purely physical causes – contrary to
the axiom that every intelligent effect must have an intelligent
cause – or to the reflection of our own thought – disproved by
the facts. The remaining points are secondary and in no way
damage the fundamental bases. There may be other schools that
seek enlightenment concerning the as-yet controversial parts of
the science, but there must not be rival sects. There should only
be antagonism between those who desire to do good and those
who have done or would desire to do evil. However, there is no
authentic Spiritist, who, after having adopted the great moral
maxims taught by the Spirits, could ever desire evil or wish evil
upon a neighbor whatever their difference of opinion. If any such
school is in error, sooner or later it will be enlightened if there
is good faith and an absence of prejudice. While they wait, all
schools possess a common bond that should unite them in the


                                  575

                             Conclusion


same thought. All of them have the same objective. The course
they take matters little, provided it leads to this objective. No
school should impose its opinion through material or moral force,
and the one that anathematized another would be on a false path,
for it would obviously be acting under the influence of evil spirits.
Reason must always be the last argument, and moderation will
better ensure the triumph of the truth than diatribes full of the
poison of envy and jealousy. Good spirits preach only unity and
love for one’s neighbor, and a malevolent or uncharitable thought
could never proceed from a pure source.
       In order to conclude, let us hear the counsels of St.
Augustine’s spirit concerning the subject:
       “For a long time, humans have torn at one another and
have anathematized one another in the name of a God of peace
and of mercy, offending God through such sacrilege. Spiritism
is the bond that will someday unite them, for it will show them
where the truth is and where the error lies. For some time to come,
however, there will continue to be scribes and Pharisees who will
deny it as they denied the Christ. Would you like to know which
spirits influence the various sects that divide the world? Judge them
by their deeds and by their principles. Good spirits have never
instigated evil; they have never counseled or condoned murder
and violence; they have never aroused party-hatreds, the thirst for
wealth or the greed for earthly things. Only persons who are good,
humane and benevolent toward all are their favorites as they are
also Jesus’ favorites, for they follow the path that leads to him.”

       ALLAN KARDEC

        The Spirits’ Book is the first volume of the Codification of the
Spiritist Doctrine and was followed by the other volumes, The Mediums’
Book, The Gospel According to Spiritism, Heaven & Hell and Genesis.
        The Spirits’ Book was originally written in French and was
first translated into English by the Briton Anna Blackwell, whose
work remained singular for the English speaking community for
nearly a century and a half. This present translation contains Ms.
Blackwell’s Preface to hers, partly in honor of her work and partly
because it contains an excellent short biography of Allan Kardec.
        • Do I possess a soul?
        • What happens to it when I die?
        • Where was my soul before I was born?
        • Why do good people suffer?
        • Why is my life so full of hardships?
        • Why are children born with deformities and congenital diseases?
        • Why do children die?
        • Do I have more than only one life to live?
        • What are spirits?
        • Is it possible to communicate with spirits?
        • What good is prayer?
        • What is the purpose of worship?
        • Do I have free will?
        • Why are there social inequalities?
        • Why are there inequalities in abilities and talents?
        • What is the nature of heaven and hell?
        • Is there life on other worlds?
        • Why is there such an enormous fear of death?

       This book provides the answers to these and many other
questions that confront us each and every day. They are answers that
were given by highly evolved discarnate spirits through mediums, and
compiled, edited and put in book form by Allan Kardec in 1857.
