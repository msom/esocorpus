             TRANSLATORS’ PREFACE

      This new translation of The Mediums’ Book is the “sequel”
to our translation of The Spirits’ Book, and the same grammatical
considerations of that work apply to this one as well. Once
again, our main purpose has been to hold as closely as possible
to Kardec’s original style, producing neither a transliteration nor
a paraphrase, but a re-textualization, rendering an acceptable
English translation. We would refer the reader to our preface in
our translation of The Spirits’ Book for a brief summary of the
grammatical devices that we have carried over into this one. Most
notably, when referring to a single generic spirit or soul, we use
the neuter pronoun it but use the relative pronoun who/whom, for
example, “The spirit who revealed itself to us said that it wanted
us to pray for it.” However, when referring to a named spirit, we
use the appropriate personal pronoun: “John’s spirit said that he
wanted us to pray for him.”
        We have also included an updated and revised version
of Anna Blackwell’s preface to her 1876 paraphrase translation,
which has served the English-reading public for so many years.
      We strongly recommend that The Spirits’ Book be read and
studied prior to The Mediums’ Book. Although the subject matter
of the latter work, i.e. spirit phenomena as manifested through
the aid of mediums, was what drew Kardec to the study of such
phenomena in the first place, and from which, under the auspices
and dictation of highly evolved spirits (“the Spirits”), he compiled
the materials for the former, that work serves as the doctrinal

                                11

foundation for the practical and experimental aspect of Spiritism
set forth in this one.
       For more information on Spiritism, Allan Kardec and the
international Spiritist movement, we would refer the reader to the
International Spiritist Council’s website at www.spiritist.org.

         ANNA BLACKWELL’S PREFACE
             TO HER VERSION

       The second volume of the Kardec series (...) addresses the
experimental application of the theoretical principles laid down in
The Spirits’ Book, the first volume of that series.
       Not only do these two books mutually elucidate each other,
but each of them may be said to imply the other as its necessary
complement, for if the principles set forth in The Spirits’ Book are
true, then the phenomena dealt with in The Mediums’ Book must
occur as a matter of course, while if the phenomena dealt with in The
Mediums’ Book really occur, their occurrence proves the truth of the
principles laid down in The Spirits’ Book, because those phenomena
are, at once, inexplicable by any other theory and easily explicable
with the aid of the theoretical principles set forth in that work.
       The Mediums’ Book is not addressed to materialists – those
must be brought from materialism to spiritualism (if such is
possible) by their personal ascertainment of the reality of modern
Spiritist “manifestations”, and by the proof that such manifestations
give for the continued existence of the souls of the deceased men
and women by whom they are produced. Rather, it is addressed
exclusively to those who already believe that there is in the human
being a principle of conscious individuality that survives the body,
and to those who consequently admit, first, the action of LAW
in the evolution of human life, and, second, the existence of the
Inscrutable Ordainer of the universe, of whose wisdom and will that


                                 13

                         Anna Blackwell’s Preface


law is the expression. It is also addressed to those who are therefore
prepared to admit, still further, that the providential ordaining may
be expected to proceed for the advancement of our knowledge of
our extra-terrestrial relations, as it does for that of the sciences,
which deal with the various departments of our terrestrial life.
       The science of mathematics, for instance, is open to every
human being, yet it was only through the mind of a Euclid that its
fundamental principles have been given to the world. Astronomy,
chemistry, electricity, etc. are open to the study and investigation of
everybody, yet the basis of each of those sciences, as of all others, has
been furnished, not by the multitude of seekers, but by the insight
of some master-mind, on whose foundations succeeding inquirers
have continued to build – and this for a very simple reason.
       The most superficial glance at the world around us suffices
to show us that the men and women of earth are, as yet, in point of
both intelligence and morality, of very slight average attainment.
They therefore need to be helped forward in every department of
intellectual inquiry by spirits from worlds of greater advancement,
who incarnate among them from time to time for the purpose of
assisting them to progress more rapidly in some given direction.
       Owing to their mental and moral backwardness, men and
women are slow to recognize the superiority of these providentially-
given pioneers, and are prone to resent, as offensive to their egos,
the suggestion that any such superiority can exist. They therefore
usually “stone the prophets” before accepting their clearer insights,
but since they always end up perceiving that such insights are the
true ground on which the further development of each branch of
science must be worked out, the progress of human knowledge,
though slow, is sure. But at what rate would that progress be
accomplished if every student – ignoring the ground-work
furnished by the master-minds of the past – undertook to build up
his or her own department of science ab initio for him or herself?


                                   14

                        Anna Blackwell’s Preface


Or if mathematics tyros, for instance, regarded it as derogatory
to their mental dignity to accept the help of a riper intellect than
their own, and considered it incumbent upon them to evolve for
themselves, from their own cognition, their own “Euclid”?
        Applying this reasoning to the system of religious philosophy
contained in Kardec’s books, it is to be remarked that, although
the domain of thought and experiment in regard to the existence
of spirits and the information they may have to give us is open to
all, the aid of some providentially-given basis of truth is even more
imperatively needed in this new department of inquiry than in any
other for the following reasons.
        In the first place, because the spirits who communicate most
frequently and habitually with humans are precisely those who are
nearest to them in ideas and in feelings, and who, consequently,
know little more than the human beings with whom they are in
sympathy, they thus can only put forth short-sighted, discrepant
and erroneous statements. In the second place, because the true
explanation of human life, to which the phenomena of spirit-
interchange are intended to lead us, is to be bound in its connection
with other modes and realms of existence that can only be made
known to us by intelligences who have reached a higher degree
of knowledge and purity, and who, not being at the command of
humans, will only transmit their teaching according to providential
ordering in a center already prepared for its reception, and with
the aid of the master-mind they themselves have selected as the
channel of that teaching, such a teaching will necessarily differ from
the various discrepant statements of the great mass of less enlightened
spirits. In addition, the proof that such teaching is what it claims
to be (information given by high order spirits in regard to matters
essential to our progress, but which, in the nature of things, we could
not find out for ourselves, and which they have therefore been charged
by Providence to bring to our knowledge) can only be found in the


                                  15

                        Anna Blackwell’s Preface


light which it throws on the nature and aim of human life, on the
ways of Providence, on duty and on destiny.
       All those who have made a serious study of the theory of
existence, which Allan Kardec was employed to develop, have
arrived at the conviction that it presents the proofs of authenticity
and superiority just set forth as conclusive, and they therefore
accept it as the fundamentals of all sciences are accepted by
students: not as exhaustive, but as the true basis of further discovery;
not as a matter of arbitrary authority, but on the broad ground of its
intrinsic reasonableness and the satisfactory solutions it gives for
the great problems of life, insoluble by any other theory.
       The high moral tone of The Mediums’ Book, as that of all
Kardec’s writings, is in unison with the assertion so often repeated
by the Spirits – whose communications he has coordinated with
such exceptional clearness and reach of thought – that the aim
of the open interchange which is now being established between
spirits and humans is not the mere gratification of curiosity, not
the mere enlargement of the sphere of interesting inquiry, not
even the mere giving of the certainty of our continued existence
beyond the grave. The sole aim of this interchange is, instead, the
moral improvement of the human race which it will accomplish
through the new light it will throw on the nature and purpose of
human life. By showing us that our present is always the result
of our past and the arbiter of our future, and that the acquisition
of wisdom and benevolence is the sole condition of happiness, this
interchange will furnish us with the most powerful incentive
to the pursuit of knowledge and the practice of kindness, and
it will thus effect the gradual amelioration of humankind that
is destined to transform the earth from a world of punishment
and discipline, as it now is, into a portal to the happier realms
of existence, to which we can only attain as the result of our
intellectual and moral improvement.


                                  16

                        Anna Blackwell’s Preface


       No serious and intelligent student of Kardec’s works has
ever doubted that the theory of human progress – of which that
early pioneer of the great spiritualistic movement of the present
day was made to lay the foundations – will eventually be accepted
as the basis of a reasoned-out religious belief not only by all those
interested in spirit manifestations but also by the world at large.
Moreover, this conviction of the providential character of the
works in question – abundantly justified by the reception they have
eventually commanded wherever they have been introduced – will
doubtless be still further strengthened by the gradual acceptance
of The Mediums’ Book in England and the United States, and
to the degree that its scope and character become known in
those countries, for while the progressive development of spirit
manifestation has constantly brought new confirmation to the
explanations of the phenomena given in this book at so early a stage
of the great movement – and often in advance of the occurrence of
the phenomena themselves – not a single phenomenon has occurred
to disprove or invalidate those explanations.
       The innumerable contradictory “theories” that have been
put forth ad nauseam by ignorant and pretentious spirits of the
Umbral – “theories” that explain neither the facts of life nor
those of spirit manifestations, and that cannot even account
for their own production – are proven by their emptiness to be
mere figments of prejudice and imagination, doomed to collapse
because of their own hollowness. On the other hand, the facts
of spirit manifestation – even the most admirable and important,
if observed mainly as matters of personal interest or curiosity (as
is too often the case), and without being connected by a theory
that can unite them into a homogenous and living whole – are as
incapable of yielding intellectual and moral fruit as are the sands of
the seashore of producing a harvest. But a theory which coincides
with and explains all these facts, and which deduces from them


                                  17

                       Anna Blackwell’s Preface


the noblest intellectual and moral consequences, offers a firm and
fruitful ground of truth and reality. The general acceptance of such
a theory can only be a question of time.
                                                    Anna Blackwell

                                 18

                    INTRODUCTION

       Each and every day, experience confirms our opinion that
the difficulties and disappointments encountered in the practice of
Spiritism result from ignorance of the Science’s principles. We are
happy to notice that the work we have done to protect its adherents
against the pitfalls of being a novitiate has been effective, and that
many have avoided them by reading this work.
       It is quite natural for those who have concerned themselves
with Spiritism to desire to personally communicate with spirits.
This work is intended to facilitate their journey, enabling them to
take advantage of the fruits of our long and laborious studies, for it
would be quite erroneous for someone to assume that, in order to
become an expert on the subject, it is enough to simply learn how
to place his or her fingers upon a table to make it turn, or to pick
up a pencil to make it write.
       One would be equally mistaken to expect to find in this work
a universal and infallible recipe for training mediums. Although
everyone already possesses the necessary inner seed qualities for
becoming a medium, such qualities express themselves in varying
degrees, and developing them depends on causes that are outside
the human will. The rules of poetry, painting and music do not
make people poets, painters or musicians if they do not have the
gift in the first place. Such rules only guide them as they use their
natural abilities. The same applies to this work. Its purpose is
to indicate the means of developing the faculty of mediumship
according to each one’s abilities, and especially to guide the use of

                                 19

                             Introduction


the faculty advantageously when it is present. This is not our sole
objective, however.
       Alongside mediums per se, the number of individuals who
are concerning themselves with spirit manifestations is increasing
every day. To guide them in their observations, to point out
the difficulties they could and certainly will meet in dealing
with a new order of things, to initiate them into the manner of
communicating with spirits, to indicate the means for receiving
good communications – such is the scope we must embrace, lest
our endeavor be incomplete. Thus, it should not seem surprising
to encounter teachings in this work that at first may appear
irrelevant – experience will prove them to be useful. After studying
this book very carefully, these individuals will better understand
the incidents they are sure to witness, and the language of certain
spirits will then seem less strange. Since it contains practical
instruction, it is not aimed exclusively at mediums, but rather to
all who wish to observe spirit phenomena.
       Some would have had us publish a more succinct practical
manual, indicating in a few words the techniques to follow in order
to communicate with spirits. These persons believe that due to its
low cost a book of this nature could be more profusely disseminated
and would therefore be a powerful means of advertisement, which
would then result in an increase in the number of mediums.
However, we think that such a work might do more harm than
good – at least for the time being. Spiritist practice is surrounded by
many difficulties and it is not always exempt from problems, which
only a serious and thorough study can prevent. Thus, we fear that
a succinct exposition might facilitate frivolous experiences, and
this would only lead to regret. These are matters that are neither
appropriate nor prudent to be toyed with, and we believe that we
would be doing a disservice to place them within reach of the first
person frivolous enough to think it would be entertaining to talk

to the dead. Instead, we will address ourselves to those who see a
serious purpose in Spiritism, who understand its great importance
and who do not intend to make communicating with the invisible
world a mere pastime.
       We had already published a Practical Instruction Manual to
guide mediums but it is now out-of-print. Although we printed
it with an eminently serious and grave objective in mind, we will
not reprint it since we did not find it complete enough to clear up
all the difficulties that may be encountered. Therefore, we have
replaced it with this work, in which we have gathered together all
the data that extensive experience and conscientious study have
enabled us to acquire. We hope that it will contribute toward
showing the essentially serious character of Spiritism, and also
toward dissipating the idea of frivolousness and entertainment.
       We will add one more important consideration: meetings
where experiments are performed lightly and without full
knowledge of the facts arouse very bad impressions in novices and
ill-disposed individuals, and cause the problems of conveying a
very wrong idea about the world of spirits, thereby encouraging
ridicule and providing well-founded grounds for criticism. That
is why disbelievers rarely leave such meetings convinced and why
they are little disposed to recognizing the serious side of Spiritism.
The ignorance and frivolousness of certain mediums has caused
greater harm to the opinion of many people than one might think.
       Spiritism has made great progress in only a few years, but
its greatest step occurred when it entered the field of philosophy
because since then it has been appreciated by enlightened persons.
Nowadays, it is no longer mere entertainment, but rather a
doctrine that those who used to ridicule table-turning no longer
find amusing. Through our endeavors to bring it along and sustain
it on such terrain, we are certain to win more dedicated adherents
than through a large number of manifestations that might be open

to abuse. We see evidence of this every day in the number of such
adherents who have resulted from simply reading The Spirits’ Book.
        After having set forth the philosophical aspect of the Spiritist
science in The Spirits’ Book, we offer in this work its practical aspect
to those who wish to concern themselves with manifestations,
whether on a personal basis or by observing the phenomena they
are called to observe. They will see herein the obstacles that they
may encounter, and they will thus have the means to avoid them.
Although this one follows the other, these two works are to a
certain point independent of each other. But to whomever wishes
to seriously delve into the subject, we recommend The Spirits’ Book
be read first, because it contains fundamental principles, without
which it may be difficult to understand some parts of this work.
        This second edition has been much improved over the
first. It has been corrected very carefully by the Spirits1, who have
added a large number of observations and instructions of utmost
interest. Since it was they who revised the entire work, approving
or modifying it as they saw fit, we can state that for the most
part it is their work, since their contribution was not only limited
to the segments actually signed by them. However, we have only
indicated their names when it seemed necessary to characterize
some of the more extensive expositions that proceeded from them
textually. Otherwise, we would have had to mention their names
on almost every page, particularly in the responses given to our
questions – a procedure that did not seem worthwhile to us. It is
well known that names are of little importance in such matters.
What is essential is that the work as a whole corresponds to the
proposed objectives. The reception given to the first edition –
imperfect though that edition was – gives us hope that the present
one will be no less welcomed.

       Even though we have added much material, including
many entire chapters, we have also eliminated a few repetitious
segments, such as the Spirit Hierarchy, which may already be
found in The Spirits’ Book. Furthermore, we have omitted from
the Glossary whatever did not properly fit the scope of this work,
and have appropriately replaced it with something more practical.
Moreover, this glossary is not complete. We intend to publish one
later and separately as a small dictionary of Spiritist philosophy.
In this edition, however, we have preserved only new or specific
words that are related to the subject at hand.

                            CHAPTER I

                               M

            Are There Spirits?
       1. The cause of doubt regarding the existence of spirits is
due primarily to ignorance of their true nature. Spirits are usually
imagined to have been created as a separate class of beings whose
existence has not yet been proven. Many persons are only familiar
with spirits because of the fantastic stories they heard as children,
which would be like trying to know someone’s life history by
reading a novel. Apart from the absurdities that upset them, they
do not try to find out if these stories, if divested of nonsensical
accessories, might have some basis in truth. They do not want to
put forth the effort to remove the bitter shell of the nut in order
to get at the kernel inside. Therefore, they reject the whole as do
those involved in religion, who, upset by certain abuses, include
the whole matter under one and the same condemnation.
       Whatever our idea about spirits may be, such belief is
necessarily based on the existence of an intelligent principle
apart from matter. This belief is incompatible with the complete
denial of such a principle. Therefore, we take our departure from
the existence, survival and individuality of the soul, of which
Spiritualism offers us a dogmatic, theoretical demonstration,
while Spiritism offers a patent demonstration. For the moment,


                                 27

                              Chapter I


however, let us set aside spirit manifestations per se, and reason by
induction. Let us see what consequences may result.
       2. If we believe in the existence of the soul and its continued
individuality after death, we must also believe that: 1) its nature is
different than that of the body since once separated from the body,
it can no longer retain its material properties; 2) it possesses its
own consciousness because it is subject to happiness or suffering.
Without consciousness, it would be an inert being, and thus its
existence would be meaningless to us. If we believe this much,
then it is obvious that the soul must go somewhere after death.
But what becomes of it, and where in fact does it go? According
to common belief, it either goes to heaven or to hell. But where
are heaven and hell? It used to be said that heaven was up above
and hell was down below, but where is up above and down below
in the universe since we know that the earth is round and that the
heavenly bodies turn in such a way that for us up above and down
below are reversed every twelve hours, and that the infiniteness
of outer space can be probed to incommensurable distances? It is
true that we can understand low places to mean the depths of the
earth, but what are such depths nowadays after they have been
excavated by geology? Moreover, what should we understand by
those concentric spheres called the ‘heaven of fire’ and the ‘heaven
of stars’ since we have learned that our planet is not the center of
the universe and that our own sun is only one among millions of
other suns that shine in the infinite, each one being the center of
its own planetary vortex? What has become of the importance of
earth now that it has been lost in the immensity of space? And
by what unjustifiable privilege would this unperceivable grain
of sand, distinguishable by neither its size nor its location, nor
any particular role in the cosmos, be the only one inhabited by
reasoning beings? Reason itself refuses to accept such a wastefulness
of the infinite, and everything tells us that other worlds must also

                                 28

                          Are There Spirits?


be inhabited. If they are inhabited, they too furnish their own
contingents to the world of souls. Once again, however, what
will have become of souls now that astronomy and geology have
destroyed their assigned dwelling places, and especially after the
rational theory of the plurality of inhabited worlds has multiplied
them infinitely? Since there is no agreement between the doctrine
concerning where souls are located and the scientific data, we
must accept a more logical doctrine, one that does not ascribe
them to any particular circumscribed locale, but which locates
them throughout universal space: they form an invisible world,
wherein we live, and which incessantly envelops and surrounds us.
Is there anything impossible in this, anything repugnant to reason?
Absolutely nothing; rather, everything tells us that it can be no
other way. But what becomes of future punishment and reward
if you remove the specified places where they occur? Notice that
the notion of punishment and reward usually results in disbelief
because it is presented under conditions that can no longer be
accepted. Instead, we should state that souls derive their own
happiness or misfortune from within themselves, that their fate
depends on their moral condition, that the gathering together of
good and attuned souls is a source of bliss, and that according to
their degree of purity, they perceive and foresee things that are
inaccessible to less evolved souls. Then, everyone will understand
the matter without much difficulty. Additionally, state that souls
only reach the highest degree through the efforts they put forth to
improve themselves and after having endured the necessary trials
required for their purification. Moreover, state that angels are
human souls who have reached the highest degree, that all souls
will reach that degree if they so will, that the angels are God’s
messengers, charged with overseeing the execution of the divine
plan all over the universe, that they are joyous at fulfilling such
a glorious mission, and you will have given their blissful state a


                                 29

                              Chapter I


purpose that is more attractive than the perpetual uselessness of
eternal contemplation. Finally, explain that demons are merely the
souls of evil individuals who have not yet purified themselves, but
who, like all others, may finally reach the state of purity, and such
will seem more in harmony with the justice and benevolence of
God than the doctrine of beings who were created for evil and
who are irrevocably doomed to it. Once more, therein lies what
the most demanding reason, the most rigorous logic and common
sense can accept.
       As we have seen, the souls that populate space are more
precisely what we call spirits. Hence, spirits are merely human
souls that have been freed of their corporeal envelope. If spirits
were created as separate beings, their existence would be more
hypothetical. However, in accepting the existence of souls, we must
therefore accept the existence of spirits, who are nothing more than
souls. And if we accept the fact that souls are everywhere, we must
equally accept the fact that spirits are too. Thus, we cannot deny
the existence of spirits without denying the existence of souls.
       3. Of course, all this is no more than a theory that is more
rational than any other, but it is a theory that contradicts neither
reason nor science. Furthermore, it is corroborated by facts and
is sanctioned by both logic and experience, and we have found
these facts in the phenomena of spirit manifestations, which thus
have provided us with patent proof of the existence and survival
of the soul. Nonetheless, there are many people whose belief does
not go beyond this point. They believe in the existence of souls
and, consequently, in the existence of spirits, but they deny the
possibility of communicating with them because – they say –
immaterial beings cannot interact with matter. This doubt results
from ignorance of the true nature of spirits, about which they
generally have a wrong idea by considering them to be abstract,
vague and undefined beings – which is not true.

                                 30

                           Are There Spirits?


       Before going any further, let us consider the spirit in its
union with the body. The spirit is the principal being of this
union, for the spirit is the thinking being that survives death. The
body is no more than an accessory for the spirit, an envelope, a
garment that it abandons after having worn it. Besides this material
envelope, the spirit possesses another, a semi-material envelope,
which connects it to the first. At death, the spirit abandons the
body but not the second covering, which we call the perispirit.
This semi-material envelope has a human form and comprises for
the spirit a fluidic, vaporous body which, although invisible to us
in its normal state, still possesses some of the properties of matter.
The spirit is therefore not a simple abstraction but a confined and
circumscribed being, which would only need to become visible
and tangible in order to resemble human creatures. Why couldn’t it
interact with matter? Because of the fluidity of its body? But isn’t it
among the most rarified fluids, such as electricity, for example, and
those that we consider the most imponderable that we encounter
the most powerful motive forces? Can’t imponderable light cause a
chemical reaction in ponderable matter? We do not yet understand
the inner nature of the perispirit, but we might imagine it as being
comprised of electrical substance or some other kind of matter
just as subtle. Then why couldn’t it have the same properties as
electricity when directed by the will?
       4. The existence of the soul and of God – the former deriving
from the latter – comprises the foundation of the entire edifice of
Spiritism. But before we can set forth any Spiritist argument, we
must be sure that whomever we are discussing the matter with
also accepts such a foundation. If we receive a negative response
to the questions: “Do you believe in God? Do you believe you
have a soul? Do you believe that the soul survives after death?”,
or if we receive the simple answer, “I don’t know; I would like to
believe it but I’m just not sure,” which, most of the time, is the same

                                  31

                               Chapter I


as a timid denial disguised under a less categorical answer so that
it does not abruptly shock what he or she regards as respectable
prejudices, it would be useless to proceed. It would be like trying to
demonstrate the properties of light to a blind person who does not
believe in the existence of light, for spirit manifestations are in fact
only effects of the properties of the soul. Thus, if we do not want
to waste our time with our conversation partner, we will need to
pursue another course of ideas.
       By accepting the basic principles, not only as a probability
but as a proven, undeniable fact, then the existence of spirits will
be a natural result.
       5. We must still determine if spirits can communicate with
humans; that is, if they can exchange thoughts with them. But why
couldn’t they? What is a human being except a spirit imprisoned
in a physical body? Why couldn’t a free spirit communicate with
a captive spirit, just as a free human can communicate with a
prisoner? If we believe in the survival of the soul after death, would
it be rational to deny the survival of its affections? In other words,
since souls are everywhere, wouldn’t it be natural to believe that
a being who had loved us during life could approach us, that it
might want to communicate with us and that it would utilize all
the means at its disposal to do so? While it was living on the earth,
didn’t it act upon the matter of its body? Wasn’t it the person’s
soul who guided the movements of his or her body? Then why,
after death, would it be prevented from expressing its thought in
conjunction with another spirit who is still linked to a body, just
as a mute uses a person who can speak in order to be understood?
       6. Let us set aside for a moment the facts we consider to be
incontestable. Let us believe in the communication with spirits
as a simple hypothesis. Let us ask disbelievers to prove to us, not
by simple negative statements – their personal opinion cannot


                                  32

                           Are There Spirits?


be considered law – but through peremptory reasons that such
communication is indeed impossible. Let us place ourselves
on their turf, and since they want to observe spirit phenomena
through physical laws, let them take some mathematical, physical,
chemical, mechanical or physiological proof from their scientific
arsenal, and demonstrate by a plus b – but always starting from the
principle of the existence and survival of the soul:
       1) that the being within us who thinks during earthly life no
longer thinks after death;
       2) that if it does think, it no longer thinks of those whom it
has loved;
       3) that if it does think of those whom it has loved, it
nonetheless does not wish to communicate with them;
       4) that if it can be anywhere it wants to be, it cannot be right
here beside us;
       5) that if it is right here beside us, it nevertheless cannot
communicate with us;
       6) that by means of its fluidic body, it cannot act upon inert
matter;
       7) that if it can act upon inert matter, it nonetheless cannot
act upon a living being;
       8) that if it can act upon a living being, it cannot guide his
or her hand in order to write;
       9) that if it is able to thus write, it cannot respond to
questions or transmit its thought.
       When Spiritism’s adversaries demonstrate to us that none of
this is possible, using reasons as obvious as those used by Galileo
to prove that the sun does not spin around the earth, then we
will admit that their doubts are well-founded. But until today,
unfortunately, their entire argument may be summed up in these
words: I do not believe in it, so it is impossible. Undoubtedly, they
will retort that it is up to us to prove that the manifestations


                                  33

                             Chapter I


are real. However, we have already given them such proof both
through the phenomena and through reason; if they refuse either
and if they even deny what they have seen with their own eyes,
then it is up to them to prove that our reasoning is faulty and that
the phenomena are impossible after all.




                                34

                                M

      The Extraordinary and
        the Supernatural
       7. If the belief in spirits and their manifestations were an
isolated concept, the product of a theory, then it could certainly be
suspected of being illusory. But who can explain to us why it may
be found to be so alive among all ancient and modern cultures and
in the holy books of all known religions? Some critics claim that it
is because throughout history, humans have loved the extraordinary.
Then we must ask: “What do you mean by extraordinary?” And they
would reply, “Whatever is supernatural.” “But what do you mean by
supernatural?” “Whatever is contrary to the laws of nature.” “Then
you are so knowledgeable about those laws that you know how to set
limits on the power of God? Very well! Then prove that the existence
of spirits and their manifestations are contrary to the laws of nature,
that it is not and cannot be one of those laws. Follow the Spiritist
Doctrine and see if all the links of the chain do not display all the
characteristics of an admirable law, which resolves everything that
philosophical principles have been unable to resolve until now.”
       Thought is one of the attributes of the spirit. The possibility
of a spirit acting upon matter, of it impressing our senses, and

                                  35

                              Chapter II


therefore of it transmitting its thought to us is a consequence (if
we may so express ourselves) of its own physiological constitution.
Hence, there is nothing supernatural or extraordinary about this
fact. However, the idea that a person who is absolutely dead could
be corporeally resuscitated, that his or her scattered remains could
be rejoined to reestablish a body, well that would be extraordinary,
supernatural and fantastic indeed, and would certainly be a true
derogation that God could only accomplish through a miracle.
There is nothing like that in the Spiritist Doctrine, however.
        8. “Nevertheless,” they will say, “you claim that a spirit can
lift a table and hold it up in the air without any support. Isn’t that
a derogation from the law of gravity?” Yes, from the law as we
have known it, but has nature already spoken her last word? Before
the experiments involving the lifting power of certain gases, who
would have thought that a heavy object carrying several persons
could overcome the power of gravity? Wouldn’t that at first have
seemed extraordinary or diabolical to a common individual? A
century ago, whoever proposed to transmit a telegram to a distance
of 1,500 miles and receive a response in only a few minutes would
have been considered crazy. And if it had actually occurred,
everyone would have believed that such a person had had the
Devil under his or her orders, because back then only the Devil
was capable of traveling so quickly. Under certain conditions then,
why couldn’t an unknown fluid possess a property that offsets the
effect of gravity on a table, just as hydrogen offsets the weight of a
balloon? We should note in passing that this is only a comparison
(not an assimilation), made solely to show by analogy that the
lifting of a table is not physically impossible. It was precisely when
learned individuals, upon observing such types of phenomena,
wanted to proceed by means of assimilation that they were led
astray. The phenomenon exists nonetheless and all the denials
in the world cannot make it otherwise, because denial does not

                                 36

                 The Extraordinary and the Supernatural


constitute proof. For us, there is nothing supernatural about it,
and that is all we have to say about it for now.
       9. “If the fact of the phenomenon is proven,” they will say,
“then, we will accept it and we will even accept the cause you
attribute to it, i.e., an unknown fluid. But who can prove that spirits
are involved? That is what is extraordinary and supernatural.”
       To meet this objection, a full demonstration of the
phenomenon would be necessary, which of course would not be
plausible here; besides, it would comprise a redundancy since the
phenomenon is emphasized in every other aspect of the teaching.
Nevertheless, in order to sum it up in a few words, we will state
that the phenomenon is theoretically based upon this principle:
every intelligent effect must have an intelligent cause. In practice,
this means that concerning the observation of so-called spirit
phenomena having given evidence of an intelligence whose cause
could not have originated in matter, that this intelligence did not
originate with the observers themselves (a fact that was proven
from the experiments themselves) but had to be independent of
them, and that since the being who produced them could not be
seen, then this intelligence had to be regarded as an invisible being.
Thus, proceeding from one observation to the next, we came to
the conclusion that this invisible being, to whom was given the
name spirit, was none other than the soul of an individual who
used to be alive corporeally, and that death had freed this soul
of its coarse visible envelope, leaving it with only an ethereal one
that is invisible in its normal state. In this, then, the extraordinary
and supernatural are reduced to a most simple explanation. The
existence of these invisible beings having been proven, it was then
shown that their action upon matter results from the nature of
their fluidic envelope. This action is intelligent, since, upon dying,
they lose only their body and retain the intelligence that comprises
their true essence. This is the key to all the phenomena erroneously

                                  37

                                  Chapter II


regarded as supernatural. Therefore, the existence of spirits does
not result from a preconceived theory or a hypothesis dreamed up
to explain the facts, but instead it is the result of observation and
the natural consequence of the existence of the soul. To deny this
cause is to deny the soul and its attributes. Those who think that
they can find a more rational solution for such intelligent effects,
and especially that they can explain away all the facts, let them do
so – then we can discuss the merits of both sides of the matter.
       10. To those who regard matter as the sole power of
nature, anything that cannot be explained by the laws of matter is
extraordinary or supernatural, and for them, the extraordinary is
synonymous with superstition. Thus, religion, which is founded
on the existence of an immaterial principle, would be the fabric of
superstition – they dare not say this out loud, but they mutter it
under their breath, and they think they can keep up appearances
by claiming that religion is necessary for people and for children
in order to make them wise. Hence, we are faced with two choices:
either the religious principle is true or it is false. If it is true, it is true
for everybody; if it is false, it is no more beneficial for uneducated
than for enlightened persons.
       11. Those who attack Spiritism by calling it extraordinary
usually find support in the materialist principle, and thus in
denying every effect of an extra-material origin, they necessarily
deny the existence of the soul. However, probe the depths of
their thought and scrutinize the meanings of their words and
you will almost always find this principle, which – even if not
categorically formulated – nonetheless shines through under the
guise of the rational philosophical pretense behind which they
hide it. Therefore, by rejecting as extraordinary everything that
results from the existence of the soul, they are at least being self-
consistent. Since they do not admit the cause, they cannot admit


                                      38

                          The Extraordinary and the Supernatural


the effect; hence the prejudice that keeps them from judging
Spiritism soundly, because they start from the principle of denying
everything that is not material. But as for us, just because we claim
that the effects result from the existence of the soul, must we
therefore accept all the facts that are deemed to be extraordinary?
Must we be the champions of all dreamers, of adepts of all sorts of
utopias and eccentric theories? One would have to know very little
about Spiritism to think so. However, this does not concern our
adversaries, since the requirement that they must understand what
they are talking about is of little interest to them.
       According to them, the extraordinary is absurd; Spiritism
is based upon extraordinary facts; therefore, Spiritism is absurd.
For them, this is a sentence that cannot be appealed. They believe
they are presenting an incontestable argument when, after erudite
research into the convulsionaries of Saint-Médard, the camisards
of Cévennes or the nuns of Loudon2, they arrive at the discovery
of fraudulent evidence that no one can contest. But are stories
such as these the Gospel of Spiritism? Have Spiritism’s supporters
ever denied that charlatanism has exploited certain incidents to
its own advantage? That imagination has engendered them? That
fanaticism has exaggerated many of them? But Spiritism is no more
responsible for extravagances that may be committed in its name
than is true science for the abuses of ignorance, or true religion for
the excesses of fanaticism. Many critics only judge Spiritism in the
light of fairytales and popular legends, which are only its fictitious
forms. That is the same as judging history in the light of historical
romances or tragedies.
      12. According to the most elementary logic, in order to
discuss a matter it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar with it,
since critics’ opinions are only worth anything when they speak

with causal knowledge. Only in this way can their opinion –
even when erroneous – be taken seriously. But what weight can it
carry when it is applied to an unfamiliar matter? True critics must
provide evidence – not just from erudition, but from a profound
knowledge of the object under consideration, and with absolute
impartiality of judgment. Otherwise, any minstrel could assume
the right to judge Rossini and any muralist could critique Rafael.
        13. Therefore, Spiritism does not accept all facts that may
be regarded as extraordinary or supernatural – far from it; instead,
it demonstrates the impossibility of a great number of them and
the foolishness of some of the beliefs that comprise superstition
per se. It is true that among the spirit phenomena that Spiritism
accepts there are some that disbelievers regard as unequivocally
extraordinary in nature; in other words, they represent superstition.
As they wish. However, they should at least limit the discussion to
these, because they have nothing to say regarding the others – they
will be “preaching to the already-converted.” By criticizing what
Spiritism itself refutes, they demonstrate their ignorance about the
subject and they miss the mark. “But how far can Spiritist belief
reach?” you will ask. Read and observe, and you will understand.
Acquiring any science demands time and study. And Spiritism,
which addresses the most serious questions of philosophy in
every sector of the social order, and which encompasses both the
physical and moral individual at the same time, is a complete
science and philosophy in itself, and it cannot be assimilated in
only a few hours – which is true of any other science. It would be
very childish to see the whole of Spiritism in a turning table, just
as it would be to see the whole of physics in a few children’s toys.
For whoever does not want to remain on the surface, months and
years, rather than hours, will have to be spent in order to probe
all its mysteries. In light of this, decide for yourself the degree of
understanding and the value of the opinions of those who assume

                                 40

                 The Extraordinary and the Supernatural


for themselves the right to judge simply because they have seen
one or two experiments by way of entertainment or as a pastime.
No doubt, they will state that they do not have the time needed for
such study. As they wish. Nothing so obliges them. However, if you
do not have time to learn about a matter, you cannot talk about it,
let alone make judgments about it – unless you want to be accused
of being irresponsible. The more elevated the position you occupy
in a science, the less excusable you will be if you thoughtlessly try
to address a subject with which you are unfamiliar.
       14. Let us summarize our stance in the following propositions:
       1) All spirit phenomena have as their principle the existence
of the soul, its survival upon the death of the body and its ability
to manifest itself;
       2) Since they result from a law of nature, these phenomena
have nothing extraordinary or supernatural about them, at least in
the common meaning of these words;
       3) Many events are regarded as supernatural because their
cause is unknown, and having determined their true cause, Spiritism
has relegated them back to the domain of natural phenomena;
       4) Among the incidents called supernatural, Spiritism shows
many of them to be impossible in the first place, and therefore
places them amongst superstitious beliefs;
       5) Although Spiritism recognizes a basis of truth for many
popular beliefs, it absolutely does not accept all the fantastic stories
created by the imagination;
       6) To judge Spiritism by facts that it itself does not accept is
to show proof of ignorance and complete disregard for the correct
opinion;
       7) The explanation of the phenomena accepted by Spiritism,
along with their causes and moral consequences, comprise an
entire science and philosophy in and of themselves, and they
require serious, persevering and in-depth study;

                                  41

                             Chapter II


       8) Spiritism can only regard as serious critics those who have
seen and studied the whole matter, who have delved into it with
the patience and perseverance of a conscientious observer, who
have as much understanding of the subject as the most enlightened
adherent, who have not therefore acquired their understanding
via literary science fiction, who will not attempt to oppose any
fact with which they are unfamiliar or any argument upon which
they have not meditated or have refuted only by denying it, but
who use other arguments that are more peremptory; finally, those
who can point to a more logical cause behind the established facts.
Such critics have yet to appear.
       15. We previously made reference to the word miracle, and
a brief observation concerning the subject would not be out of
place in a chapter dealing with the extraordinary.
       In its primitive acceptation and according to its etymology,
the word ‘miracle’ means something extraordinary, something
wonderful to behold. But this word, like so many others, has strayed
far from its original meaning and nowadays refers to (according
to academia) an act of divine power that is contrary to the common
laws of nature. Such is actually its usual acceptation and only by
comparison or metaphor does it apply to common things that
surprise us and whose cause is unknown to us. We have absolutely
no intention of examining whether or not, under certain
circumstances, God might deem it useful to derogate from the laws
that have been divinely established. Our objective is solely to show
that as extraordinary as spirit phenomena may be, they do not in
any way derogate from those laws, nor is there any miraculous –
much less extraordinary or supernatural – character about them.
A miracle has no rational explanation. Spirit phenomena, on the
other hand, may be explained in a most rational manner. Thus,
they are not miracles, but rather simple effects that have their
reason for being included among general laws. A miracle has yet

                                 42

                 The Extraordinary and the Supernatural


another characteristic: it is an uncommon and isolated event;
thus any event that can be reproduced at will (so to speak) and by
several individuals cannot be a miracle.
       Science performs miracles every day in the eyes of the
uncultivated. That is why it used to be that those who knew more
than the common folk were regarded as witches, and since it was
believed that all supra-human science was diabolical, they were
burned at the stake. Nowadays we are more ‘civilized’ and it is
sufficient to put them in an asylum!
       If someone were really dead and were resuscitated by divine
intervention, then, as we stated earlier, we would have a true miracle,
because it would be contrary to the laws of nature. However, if the
person only appeared to be dead and still preserved a fragment
of latent vitality, and science or some magnetic action managed
to reanimate him or her, then, to enlightened individuals, such
would merely be a natural phenomenon. Nevertheless, in the eyes
of uncultivated folk, the incident would be regarded as miraculous,
and its author would either be chased with stones or venerated,
depending on the character of the individuals. If in a rural area
a physicist were to fly a kite rigged to attract electricity, which
then caused a bolt to strike a tree, this new Prometheus would
certainly be viewed as possessing some diabolical power. Moreover,
one could say that, remarkably, Prometheus seems to us to have
been a precursor to Benjamin Franklin, while Joshua, in making
the sun – or rather, the earth – stand still, would provide us with a
true miracle, because we have never heard of any magnetizer gifted
with enough power to perform such a wonder.
       Of all the spirit phenomena, one of the most extraordinary
and indisputable, and one that most obviously demonstrates the
action of hidden intelligences, involves direct writing. Despite the
fact that it is produced by hidden beings, however, this particular
phenomenon is no more miraculous than any of the others that


                                  43

                             Chapter II


are also caused by invisible agents, for these invisible beings who
inhabit space are one of the very powers of nature, a power that
unceasingly acts both upon the physical and mental worlds.
       By enlightening us concerning the true nature of this power,
Spiritism has provided us with the key to an infinite number of
occurrences that are unexplained and unexplainable matters in any
other way, and which in remote times were regarded as wonders.
As was the case with magnetism, Spiritism has revealed, if not an
unknown law, at least a poorly understood one, or rather, a law
whose effects we have always known about because they have been
produced down through the ages, but whose governing law had
been unknown; it was therefore ignorance of such law that gave
rise to superstition. However, since the law has been understood,
the extraordinary has disappeared and the phenomena have been
reintegrated into the order of natural events. Hence, by enabling
a table to move or the dead to write, Spiritists do not perform any
more of a miracle than a doctor who revives a person on the edge
of death, or a physicist who manages to attract a bolt of lightning.
Anyone who intended to perform miracles with the help of Spiritist
science would either be ignorant of the Doctrine or a charlatan.
      16. Like magnetic phenomena, spirit phenomena passed as
wonders before their cause was fully understood. And opinionated
skeptics, i.e., those who think they have exclusive rights to reason
and common sense, do not believe that something is possible
if they cannot understand it, and that is why all the so-called
prodigious phenomena have been the object of their ridicule.
Since religion itself is full of phenomena of this kind, they do not
believe in religion either, and from there it is only a small step
to complete disbelief. However, since Spiritism is able to explain
most of these phenomena, it justifies their very existence; thus, it
has come to aid religion by demonstrating the possibility of some
of the phenomena, which, even though no longer miraculous,

                                44

                        The Extraordinary and the Supernatural


are nonetheless extraordinary, and God is neither more nor less
powerful at not having derogated from the divine laws. How
many jokes have had the levitations of St. Cupertino as their
object! Nevertheless, the suspension of heavy objects in the air is
an occurrence explained by Spiritist law. We have personally been
eye witnesses of the St. Cupertino-type phenomenon, which Mr.
Home and many other persons known to us have repeated many
times. Thus, this phenomenon must also be included in the order
of natural events.
      17. Among the number of phenomena of this kind,
apparitions should be given first place since they are the most
frequent. The apparition at La Salette, about which there are
divergent opinions among the clergy, is nothing remarkable to
us. Assuredly, we cannot go so far as to safely affirm the reality
of the event, because we have no material proof of the matter;
nevertheless, we certainly consider it possible in light of the
thousands of similar recent3 events with which we are familiar. We
believe in them not only because we have verified their reality, but
especially because we know perfectly well how they are produced.
Those wishing to refer to the theory on apparitions, which we will
provide further on, will see that these phenomena are as simple
and plausible as an infinite number of physical phenomena that
only appear prodigious when we lack the key to explaining them.
      As for the actual personage that presented itself at La Salette,
that is a different issue. Its identity has never been absolutely
proven to us, and we only accept the fact that some kind of
apparition could have appeared; the rest of the details are outside
our competency to judge. Each one may keep his or her own
convictions regarding the matter, but Spiritism does not need to
be concerned with it. We will only state that the facts produced

                             Chapter II


by Spiritism have revealed new laws and have given us the key to a
multitude of incidents that formerly seemed supernatural. If some
of those supposed miraculous facts find a logical explanation in
Spiritism, it is one more reason for people not to be in a hurry to
deny what they do not comprehend.
       Spirit phenomena have been contested by some individuals
precisely because they appeared to be outside ordinary laws and
because an explanation for them could not be found; however,
provide them with a rational basis and there can be no more doubt.
In this century, in which no one is satisfied with mere words, an
explanation is therefore a powerful motive for conviction. Thus,
every day we see persons who have never even witnessed one
phenomenon, who have never seen a table move or a medium
write, but who are nevertheless as convinced as we are solely
because they have read and understood. If we had to believe only
what we have actually seen with our own eyes, our convictions
would be reduced to insignificance.

       18. One very natural and praiseworthy desire that adherents
have, and which should always be encouraged, is that of winning
converts. To make their task easier, we now intend to examine what
we believe are the surest means to realize this objective without
wasting any useless efforts.
       We have stated that Spiritism is an complete science, an
entire philosophy in and of itself. Those who would desire to
become thoroughly familiar with it must first of all submit to a
serious study of the subject and become persuaded that, more than
any other science, it cannot be learned without commitment. As
we stated earlier, Spiritism applies to all the issues that interest
humankind. It is an immense field and we must above all consider
it as to its consequences. Its foundation undoubtedly consists in
the belief in spirits, but such belief does not make a knowledgeable
Spiritist any more than a belief in God makes a theologian. Thus,
let us see what might be the most suitable way to proceed in its
teaching in order to most effectively bring about conviction.
       Adherents need not be frightened by the word ‘teaching’; it
is not solely the product of the lecture stand or podium, but it also
occurs in simple conversation. Every person who tries to persuade


                                 47

                              Chapter III


another by means of explanations or experiences teaches. What
we want is for the teaching effort to produce results, and that is
why we believe our task should be that of providing a few words
of advice that may be equally beneficial to those who want to learn
by themselves. They will find the means herein to most surely and
quickly reach their goal.
        19. It is generally believed that in order to be convincing, it
is enough to simply present the facts. This would certainly appear
to be the most logical approach, though experience has shown
that it is not always the best, because we frequently encounter
individuals who are not at all convinced by the most obvious facts.
Why is this? That is what we shall try to determine.
        In Spiritism, the matter of spirits is secondary and successive;
it is not the starting point, and this is precisely the error into which
one falls and often the reason for one’s failure with certain people.
Since spirits are simply human souls, the correct starting point is
therefore the existence of the soul. How could materialists accept
the existence of beings that live outside the material world, when
they believe themselves to be only matter? How could they believe
that there are spirits all around them if they do not believe there
is one within themselves? It would be pointless to amass the most
tangible proofs right in front of them; they would contest all of
them because they do not believe in the principle.
        Every teaching methodology must proceed from the known
to the unknown, and for the materialist, the known is matter.
Thus, before anything else, you should start with matter and try to
show and convince them that there is something within them that
is outside the laws of matter. In a word, before trying to make them
Spiritists, try to make them SPIRITUALISTS. To do so, however,
you need another order of facts and you must proceed to a special
form of teaching via other means. If you talk to them about spirits
before they are even convinced that they possess a soul, you are

                                  48

                             Methodology


starting at the end point, since they cannot accept the conclusion
if they have not accepted the premise.
       Therefore, before trying to convince disbelievers – even
by using facts – it is advisable to make sure of their opinion
concerning the soul; that is, determine if they believe that it exists,
that it survives the body and retains its individuality after death.
If their response is negative, it will be a waste of time to talk to
them about spirits. That is the rule. We are not saying there are
no exceptions, but if there are exceptions, there would have to be
some other reason for those particular persons to be less resistant.
       20. We must distinguish between two classes of materialists:
in the first class are those who are theoretical materialists. There is
no doubt in them, but rather absolute denial, arrived at through
their own reasoning. In their view, humans are nothing more than
a machine that functions while assembled, and which breaks down
and leaves only a skeleton at death. Their number is happily quite
restricted and they do not represent an openly declared school
of thought. We do not need to point out the deplorable effects
that would result for the social order if some such doctrine were
popularized. We have dealt with this matter quite sufficiently in
The Spirits’ Book (no. 147 and Sect. III of the Conclusion).
       When we stated that disbelievers stop doubting when faced
with a rational explanation, we must make an exception of radical
materialists, who deny every power and any intelligent principle
apart from matter. Most of them hold to their opinion out of pride
and believe that they must maintain it out of self-respect. They
persist in it in spite of all evidence to the contrary because they do
not want to lose face. Nothing can be done with people like these.
No one should be fooled by their false expression of sincerity when
they say, “Show me and I’ll believe it.” Then again, there are those
who are more honest, who bluntly say, “Even if you show me, I
won’t believe it.”

                                  49

                               Chapter III


       21. The second class of materialists, which is much more
numerous than the first class, since materialism is an unnatural
sentiment, includes those who are such out of indifference and,
we might add, out of a lack of something better. These have not
deliberately chosen materialism and their greatest desire is to
believe, for they are tormented by uncertainty. They feel a vague
aspiration about the future, but this future has been presented
to them in a light that their reason cannot accept; hence their
doubt, and therefore, disbelief. For them, disbelief is not based
on any kind of theory. As soon as you present them with
something rational, they will eagerly accept it. They are capable
of understanding us, since they are closer to us than they might
suppose. With the first group, do not talk about revelation or
angels or heaven, because they will not understand you. Instead,
place yourselves on their own turf and prove to them first of all
that the laws of physiology are powerless to explain everything –
the rest will follow later. The situation is otherwise when disbelief
is not preconceived, because in that case, belief is not completely
non-existent; rather, it remains as a latent sprout that has been
choked by weeds, but which a spark can bring back to life. These
individuals are like blind persons who have received their sight
and are happy at seeing the light, or like a shipwreck victim who
has been tossed a life preserver.
       22. Alongside the materialists per se there is a third class of
disbelievers who, although they are at least spiritualists in name, are
no less resistant toward Spiritism: these are ill will disbelievers. They
would feel annoyed if they had to believe because they feel that
it would interfere with their tranquility in materialistic pleasures.
They are afraid that their ambition might be condemned, along
with their selfishness and the human vanities they love to indulge
in. They shut their eyes in order not to see and they plug their ears
in order not to hear. We can only pity them.

                                   50

                             Methodology


      23. So as not to fail to mention it, we will point out a fourth
category that may be called self-interested or bad faith disbelievers.
They know very well what to think about Spiritism but they openly
condemn it for personal interest reasons. We have nothing to say
about them, nor anything to do with them. If radical materialists
are in the wrong, they at least have good faith as an excuse – we
can correct them by showing them their error. But with this last
group, there is a bias that turns all arguments to dust. Time will
take care of opening their eyes and will show them where their true
interests lie – perhaps at their own cost – because, being unable to
hinder the expansion of the truth, they will be swept along by the
current together with the interests they had sought to safeguard.
       24. In addition to these overall categories of opponents,
there are many nuances, among which may be counted:
disbelievers out of cowardice, who will find courage when they see
that others have not been harmed by Spiritism; disbelievers out
of religious scruples, whom an enlightened study will teach that
Spiritism is supported by the very fundamentals of religion itself,
that it respects all belief systems and that some of its effects are
the awakening of the religious sentiments in those who do not
already have them, and the strengthening of them in those who are
irresolute; additionally, there are disbelievers out of pride, out of a
contrary spirit, negligence, frivolousness, etc.
       25. Let us not forget a category that we shall call disbelievers
out of deception. It includes those who have gone from being
exaggeratedly confident to disbelief because they have suffered
deception. Thus, being disheartened, they have abandoned and
rejected everything. They are like those who deny Spiritism in good
faith because they feel they have been misled. This is nonetheless
the result of both an incomplete study of Spiritism and a lack
of experience. If there are those who are deceived by spirits, it is


                                  51

                             Chapter III


usually because they ask them improper questions or ones they
cannot answer, or because they are not enlightened enough to
distinguish truth from error. Also, many people only see Spiritism
as a new form of divinization and think that spirits exist for the
purposes of fortune telling. In fact, frivolous and mocking spirits
do not waste the opportunity to entertain themselves at these
individuals’ expense; thus, they promise girls that they will find
marriage and assure the ambitious that they will receive honors,
inheritances and hidden treasures, and so on and so forth. The
result: the frequent and unpleasant deceptions that serious and
prudent persons always know how to avoid.
      26. The most numerous of all classes, but which cannot
be included among the class of opponents, consists of hesitant
individuals, who are usually spiritualists out of principle. Most of
them have a vague intuition about spiritual ideas and they aspire
toward something that they are not quite able to define – they
only need to coordinate and formulate their thoughts. Spiritism
appears to them like a ray of light – the clarity that dissipates the
fog. Consequently, they avidly embrace it, for it sets them free
from the anguish of uncertainty.
       27. If we now take a look at the various categories of
believers, we will first discover those who are Spiritists without
realizing it. Properly speaking, these are a variety or nuance of the
preceding class. Even though they have never heard of the Spiritist
Doctrine per se, they have an innate sentiment about the grand
principles that result from it, and this sentiment is reflected in
certain passages of their writings and discourses to the extent
that if you listened to them, you would believe that they were
true initiates. Many examples of these individuals can be found
among sacred and secular writers alike, and among poets, orators,
moralists, and ancient and modern philosophers.


                                 52

                                         Methodology


       28. Among those who have become convinced by directly
studying the subject, we may distinguish:
       1) Those who believe purely and simply in the manifestations,
who consider Spiritism to be a simple science of observation that
demonstrates a series of more or less curious phenomena. We call
them experimental Spiritists.
       2) Those who see in Spiritism more than just the phenomena,
who understand Spiritism’s philosophical aspect. They believe in
the morality that results from it but they fail to practice it, and the
Doctrine’s actual influence upon their character is thus insignificant
or none at all. They do not change their habits, nor would they
deprive themselves of one single pleasure. Misers remain miserly;
the proud remain full of themselves; the envious and jealous
remain aggressive. They see Christian charity as nothing more
than a pretty maxim. They are imperfect Spiritists.
       3) Those who are not content with only admiring Spiritist
morality but who practice it and accept all its consequences. Since
they are convinced that earthly existence is only a temporary trial,
they try to take advantage of such a brief moment to advance
on the path of progress – the only one that can lead them to a
higher position in the spirit world – endeavoring to do good and
subdue their evil tendencies. Friendship with them is always safe,
for their firmness of conviction keeps them from all thoughts of
evil. Charity is the rule of conduct among them. These are true
Spiritists, or better still, Christian Spiritists.4
       4) Finally, there are fanatical Spiritists. The human species
would be perfect if it always preferred the good side of things.
Exaggeration in any way is harmful, and in Spiritism it produces
a blind and often childish confidence in the manifestations of
the invisible world, leading some very easily and uncontrollably
4
    “... the true Spiritist and the true Christian are one and the same thing, for all who practice
    charity are Jesus’ disciples, whatever the denomination to which they belong.” (Paul the
    Apostle, Paris, 1860. The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. XV, no. 10)



                                                53

                              Chapter III


to accept what reflection and examination would show to be
absurd or impossible. Fanaticism does not think; it dazzles. These
adherents are more noxious than useful to Spiritism’s cause. They
are less capable of being convincing since their judgment is rightly
distrusted. They are easily fooled by fraudulent spirits or by
persons who try to exploit their gullibility. If they were the only
ones who had to suffer the consequences, the harm would not be
so great, but the worst outcome is that, without meaning to do so,
they provide disbelievers with more reasons to ridicule Spiritism
than to be convinced by it, and they do not fail to impute to all the
foolishness of a few. Obviously, this is neither fair nor rational, but
it is well known that Spiritism’s adversaries only recognize their
own reason as genuine, and care little about fully understanding
the object of their consideration.
      29. The means of conviction vary considerably among
individuals, and what persuades some will have no impression
on others. Even though one person may be convinced by
certain physical manifestations and another by intelligent
communications, most are persuaded by reasoning. We could even
say that for most of those who still cannot appreciate Spiritism
through reason, the physical phenomena will have little impact.
The more extraordinary the phenomena in the way they seem
to depart substantially from known laws, the more opposition
they encounter, and for a very simple reason: we are naturally
led to doubt anything that is not sanctioned by reason. All will
consider them from their own point of view and offer their own
individual explanation: the materialist attributes to them a purely
physical cause or a hoax; the ignorant or superstitious person, to
a diabolical or supernatural cause. However, an explanation that
is prepared beforehand has the effect of destroying preconceived
ideas and showing at least the possibility if not the entire reality
of the fact, which is thus comprehended before it is seen. So by

                                  54

                            Methodology


accepting the possibility of a fact, three-fourths of the conviction
has been realized.
       30. Will it be of any use at all to try to convince obstinate
disbelievers? We have already stated that this will depend on
the causes and nature of their disbelief. Our insistence in trying
to persuade them often leads them to believe in their own self-
importance, which in turn leads them to be even more obstinate.
Those who are neither convinced by reasoning nor phenomena
still have the trial of disbelief to endure, and we must leave to
Providence the task of leading them onto the path of more
favorable circumstances. There are too many other people who
desire to receive the light for us to waste our time on those who
reject it. Therefore, direct your efforts toward those of goodwill,
who are greater in number than you might think. Your example
will overcome any resistance more easily than will mere words.
True Spiritists never lack an opportunity to do good: afflicted
hearts to relieve, consolation to offer, desperate emotions to calm,
moral reforms to instill. This is their mission, wherein they will
find true satisfaction. Spiritism pervades the atmosphere; it is
expanding because of the very force of circumstances and because
it enables those who profess it to be happy. When its theoretic
adversaries hear it resounding all around them – even among their
own friends – they will come to grips with their isolation and will
be forced either to fall silent or surrender.
       31. In order to proceed with the teaching of Spiritism
in the same manner as occurs in the other ordinary sciences, it
would be necessary to review the entire string of phenomena that
may be produced, starting with the simplest and then progressing
successively to the most complicated. However, such would be
impossible because one cannot take a course in experimental
Spiritism as if it were a course in physics or chemistry. When


                                55

                             Chapter III


studying the natural sciences, one is dealing with raw matter,
which can be manipulated at will, and the effects may almost
certainly be controlled. But with Spiritism, one must deal with
intelligences who are gifted with freedom, and who at every
instant prove that they are not at all subject to our capricious
whims. Thus, it is necessary to observe, to await the results and
reap them as they occur. That is why we vehemently state: all those
who would flatter themselves by imagining they can obtain results at
will are nothing more than ignorant persons or impostors. That is
also why true Spiritism will never put on exhibitions or resort to
stage shows. It would moreover be illogical to suppose that spirits
would ever take part in such exhibitions and submit themselves
to research like objects of curiosity. Hence, the phenomena may
not occur at the most desired moment, or they might occur in a
much different way than what we intended. We might add further
that in order to obtain them, we need persons who are endowed
with special faculties, and such faculties vary widely, depending on
the aptitude of each particular individual. In addition, since it is
extremely rare for one and the same individual to possess all the
various aptitudes, the difficulty increases due to our always having
to have a truly complete collection of mediums at our disposal,
which in itself would never be possible.
       The way to remedy such an inconvenience is really quite
simple: one only needs to begin with the theory, wherein all the
phenomena are reviewed and explained, and wherein one can
recognize them and understand the possibility that they will
occur, and can know about the conditions under which they may
be produced, and the obstacles that may be encountered. In this
way, whatever may be the order in which the circumstances lead
us to witness them, nothing will come as a surprise. And there
is a further advantage: that of sparing those who wish to work
alone from many deceptions. Being aware of the difficulties ahead


                                 56

                                        Methodology


of time, they can stay alert and spare themselves from gaining
experience at their own expense.
       Since the time we began to concern ourselves with
Spiritism, it would be difficult to determine the number of
people who have approached us, and how many among these
remained indifferent or disbelieving when confronted with the
most obvious phenomena, only to be convinced later through
a rational explanation; how many others were predisposed to
accept Spiritism through their reasoning, and how many, finally,
were persuaded without having witnessed anything at all, but
were led to it because they comprehended it. Therefore, we speak
from experience, and that is why we have affirmed that the best
method of teaching Spiritism is the one that is geared toward the
reason and not the eyes. This is the method we use in our lessons,
and for which we congratulate ourselves.5
       32. Studying the Spiritist theory beforehand has a further
advantage in that it immediately shows the grandeur of the goal
and the scope of this science. Those who first come to watch a
table turn or produce raps may be inclined to ridicule it since it is
difficult to imagine that a table could give rise to a doctrine meant
to regenerate humankind. We have always noticed the fact that
rather than being superficial, those who believe without having
seen, but because they have read and comprehended, are the most
thoughtful. Connecting more with the foundation than the form,
they see the philosophical aspect as the most important and the
phenomena per se as only accessories. They have stated that even
if there were no phenomena at all, the philosophy in and of itself
is the only one that can resolve the many problems that until now
have been unsolvable; the only one that offers the most rational
theory concerning humankind’s past and future. Thus, they prefer

a doctrine that correctly explains matters to one that does not
explain them or that explains them badly. Whoever would reflect
on the issue will clearly understand that one could disregard the
manifestations without the doctrine itself having to disappear. The
manifestations corroborate and confirm the doctrine, but they do
not comprise its essential foundation. The serious observer does not
reject them but, on the contrary, waits for favorable circumstances
that will allow him or her to witness them. Our progress is proven
by the fact that before even hearing about the manifestations, many
people already had an intuition about the Doctrine, which merely
came to embody their ideas in a coherent whole.
       33. Nevertheless, it would not be correct to say that those
who begin with only the theory lack knowledge of the object of
practical observation. On the contrary, they do have such knowledge
and it carries more weight than if the phenomena were produced
right in front of them. These involve the numerous occurrences of
spontaneous manifestations, which we shall deal with in following
chapters. There are few persons who do not know about them,
or who have at least heard of them, and there are many who have
experienced them without having paid proper attention to them.
The theory has provided an explanation for them, and we consider
such incidents to be highly important when they are supported
by irrefutable testimony since one cannot attribute any kind of
preparation or connivance to them. Even if artificially produced
phenomena did not exist, spontaneous ones would not fail to
occur, and if Spiritism only served to explain them rationally, that
would be quite enough. Thus, most of those who read beforehand
report their recollections of such phenomena, which are for them a
confirmation of the theory.
     34. From our point of view, it would be a mistake to
suppose that we have ever recommended that the factual incidents


                                 58

                             Methodology


be neglected, since it was through such incidents that we arrived at
the theory. It is true that we had to devote ourselves to an assiduous
task that took several years and thousands of observations.
However, since these incidents have served us and continue to
serve us daily, it would be inconsistent on our part if we contested
their importance, especially now that we have written a book to
make them known. We are merely affirming the fact that apart
from reason they are not enough to lead to conviction; that a prior
explanation for them, which removes prejudices and shows that
they are not contrary to reason, predisposes them to be accepted.
       This fact is so certain that of ten individuals who are
totally new to the matter, who watch an experimental session that
followers might regard as having been quite satisfactory, nine will
leave unconvinced, and perhaps a few of them will be even more
skeptical than before because the experiments did not correspond
to what they had expected. But just the opposite will happen
with those who comprehend the manifestations through a prior
theoretical understanding. Such an understanding will serve them
as a means of control and nothing will surprise them – not even
an unsuccessful experiment – because they will know under what
conditions the phenomena may be produced, and that they must
not ask for something that cannot be given. An understanding of the
manifestations beforehand enables them not only to be aware of all
the anomalies, but also to capture innumerable details and nuances
that are almost always extremely subtle, and which will serve them as
elements of conviction that could easily escape the ignorant observer.
These are the reasons that have led us to admit to our experimental
sessions only those persons who have been sufficiently prepared to
comprehend what occurs there, because we are convinced that any
others would be wasting their time or would cause us to waste ours.
      35. For those who desire to acquire this preliminary
understanding through our works, we recommend the following order:

       1) What Is Spiritism?: This booklet of only a hundred pages or
so presents a summary of the principles of the Spiritist Doctrine, a
general overview that enables one to see the whole in a condensed
picture. In only a few words, one can ascertain its objective and
judge its scope. Furthermore, it presents the principal questions or
objections that newcomers are usually inclined to raise. Such an
initial reading, which requires but little time, is an introduction
that will facilitate a more in-depth study.
       2) The Spirits’ Book: This book contains the complete Doctrine
as dictated by the Spirits themselves, and contains their entire
philosophy and all its moral implications. It reveals humankind’s
destiny and provides an initiation into the understanding of the
nature of spirits and the mysteries of life beyond the grave. By
reading it, one comprehends that Spiritism has a serious objective
and that it is not a frivolous pastime.
       3) The Mediums’ Book: This book is intended to guide
those who wish to become involved with the manifestations, and
provides an understanding of the most appropriate means for
communicating with spirits. It is a guide for both mediums and
evokers, and supplements The Spirits’ Book.
       4) Revue Spirite6: This journal is an assorted collection of
phenomenological incidents, theoretical explanations and separate
excerpts, which supplement what is found in the other previously-
mentioned works, somewhat comprising their practical application.
It may be read simultaneously with the others, although it will be
more profitable, and especially more intelligible if one reads it after
having read The Spirits’ Book.
       That is the suggested order as far as we are concerned.
However, those who want to understand a science completely
ought to read everything that has been written about it, or at least

    Unfortunately, all the back issues of this journal are available only in French and
    Portuguese. Thus, throughout this translation, all the author’s references to it will be kept

about its main principles, and they should not limit their reading
to just one author. They should even read the pros and cons, the
critiques as well as the defenses, and learn about the different
theories in order to be able to judge by comparison. In this respect,
we neither recommend nor criticize any work, because we do not
want to influence anyone’s ability to form his or her own opinion.
In adding our brick to the building, we only fill our own particular
niche. It is not our responsibility to be both judge and litigant,
and we have no foolish pretence of being the only ones capable
of spreading the Light. Rather, it is the reader’s responsibility to
separate the good from the bad, the correct from the erroneous.

                       Theories
       36. When the strange phenomena of Spiritism began to
occur, or rather, when they began to recur in these latter days,
they engendered more doubt than anything as to their reality and
even more as to their cause. When they were verified by irrefutable
testimony and by experiments that anyone could conduct, the
result was that everyone had their own way of interpreting them
according to their own personal ideas, beliefs and prejudices.
Hence, numerous theories began to appear, which careful
observation would reduce to their real worth.
       Spiritism’s adversaries soon saw in these differing opinions
a counter-argument, alleging that Spiritists themselves were
unable to agree with one another. It was a very precarious reason,
however, when one considers the fact that the first few steps of
any developing science are necessarily uncertain until time enables
the gathering and coordinating of the facts into a set opinion.
As facts become complete and better observed, premature ideas
are set aside and unity of opinion is finally established – at least
concerning the fundamental points if not as to all the details. Such
was also the case with Spiritism, which was unable to escape this
common law and which due to its very nature gave rise even more


                                63

                             Chapter IV


to a diversity of interpretations. Nevertheless, we can state that in
this sense, its advance has been much more rapid than that of older
sciences – medicine, for example, which still continues to divide
the best scholars.
        37. To methodically follow a progressive order of ideas, it
might be useful to investigate first the so-called negative theories;
i.e., those proposed by the adversaries of Spiritism. We have already
refuted such objections both in the Introduction and Conclusion
of The Spirits’ Book, as well as in the shorter work entitled What
Is Spiritism? Thus, it would not be worthwhile to return to the
subject in full here and we will limit ourselves to summarizing in a
few words the reasons upon which the objections are based.
        There are two types of spirit phenomena: those involving
physical effects and those involving intelligent effects. Since they
do not believe in the existence of spirits – they do not believe
in anything apart from matter – it is understandable that these
adversaries of Spiritism would also deny the intelligent effects. As
for the physical effects, they comment on them from their own
point of view and their arguments can be summed up in the four
following theories.
       38. THE CHARLATANISM THEORY: Among the
antagonists, many attribute the physical effects to fraud due to the
fact that some of them may be imitated. This supposition would
turn all Spiritists into dupes and all mediums into charlatans
without even considering these individuals’ status, character,
wisdom and honorability. If it deserved any kind of response at
all, we would counter that some of the phenomena of physics
have also been imitated by stage magicians, which proves nothing
against the real science. Moreover, there are persons whose
character dismisses any suspicion of fraud, and one would have
to be completely lacking in good manners and civility to dare to


                                 64

                                Theories


tell them to their face that they are accomplices in charlatanism.
In one very respectable meeting place, a gentleman who regarded
himself as well-mannered made an observation of such kind and
the hostess said, “Sir, if you are not satisfied, you can get your
money back at the door,” and she pointed to the door, implying
what would be best for him to do. Should we affirm that there have
never been abuses? If so, we would have to believe that humans
are perfect. Instead, they abuse everything – even what is most
sanctified. Then why would some not also abuse Spiritism? But
the fact that something can be used wrongly is no reason for one to
prejudge it unfavorably. We can determine the good faith of others
by the motives behind their actions. Where there is no profit to be
made, there is no motive for charlatanism.
       39. THE MADNESS THEORY: Out of condescension,
some dismiss any suspicion of fraud and assert that those who are
not fooled by others are nonetheless victims of self-deception, which
is equivalent to calling them imbeciles. But when disbelievers are
less tactful, they frankly state that it is a simple case of madness,
unceremoniously attributing to themselves the sole privilege of
sanity. This is the main argument of those who can come up with
no better reason. Moreover, this form of criticism is proven foolish
by its own frivolousness and it does not deserve the time that would
be wasted in refuting it. Besides, Spiritists are hardly affected by it.
They courageously follow their path, consoled by the thought that
they have many people of uncontestable merit as their companions
in misfortune. In fact, one would have to admit that this madness,
if it may be regarded as such, displays a peculiar characteristic: it
seems to show a preference for reaching the most enlightened class
of individuals, whom Spiritism presently counts as being by far the
majority of its adherents. If among them there are a few eccentrics,
they pose no more of a threat against Spiritism than do religious
fanatics against religion, melomaniacs against music, or mathematical

                                  65

                             Chapter IV


maniacs against mathematics. All systems have their fanatics and
one would have to be very obtuse to confuse the exaggeration of a
system with the system itself. For a broader treatment of the issue,
we would refer the reader to the booklet What Is Spiritism? or The
Spirits’ Book, section XV of the Introduction.
       40. THE HALLUCINATION THEORY: Another
opinion, which is less offensive because it has a scientific nuance,
entails attributing the phenomena to an illusion of the senses. Thus,
observers might be of good faith, but they see something that is
not really there. When they see a table rise and remain suspended
in the air without any visible support, it means that the table did
not actually move. Their seeing it in the air is due to an illusion
or some kind of refractory effect, like that which makes us see in
the water a reflection of a star or some other object that appears to
have been dislocated from its true position. That may be possible,
but those who have witnessed this particular phenomenon are able
to affirm that the table really was suspended because they were
able to walk underneath it, which would have been quite difficult
if it had not actually left the ground. Additionally, many times
after having been raised, the table breaks when it hits the floor.
Could that also be an optical illusion?
       A well recognized physiological cause may undoubtedly
make us see something turn which is not actually moving at all,
or make us feel as though we are spinning when in fact we are
standing still. However, when several persons are gathered around
a table that is pulled by a movement that is so rapid that it is
difficult to follow – some are even knocked down – could they
have suddenly been overcome with vertigo like a drunkard who
believes he sees his house pass right in front of him?
      41. THE CRACKLING TENDON THEORY: If such
were the case with the sense of sight, it would be no different


                                 66

                                         Theories


with hearing. But when all the raps are heard by an entire group,
they cannot reasonably be attributed to an auditory illusion. Also,
we have dismissed the whole notion of fraud, since attentive
observation has proven that there was no fortuitous or material
cause involved.
       It is true that a learned physician has given a peremptory
explanation for the matter, according to his own opinion7: “The
cause results from the voluntary or involuntary contractions of
the muscle tendon of the fibula.” And with respect to this subject
he used the most complete anatomical minutiae to demonstrate
the mechanism for producing these crackling noises to imitate the
beating of a drum and even to perform rhythmic arias. Thus, he
concluded that those who hear the raps from a table are victims
of either a hoax or of an illusion. This fact in itself is nothing
new. Unfortunately, for the author of that alleged discovery, his
theory cannot explain away all the cases. First, let us state that
those who are gifted with the strange ability to make the tendon
of the fibula, or any other tendon crackle at will and play musical
arias are exceptional creatures, while making tables crackle is
quite common, and those who have that ability rarely have the
ability to do the other. Second, the learned doctor forgot to
explain how the crackling tendons of a person who is motionless
and at some distance from the table can produce vibrations that
may be sensed by the touch; how the crackles can be heard by
the participants at will and in various areas of the table, in other
furniture, in walls, in the ceiling, etc.; how, finally, the action of
the tendon can extend to a table that is not being touched at all
and make it move by itself. Besides, if this theory really explained
anything at all, it would only invalidate the rap phenomenon,
7
    Dr. Jobert (de Lamballe). For us to be fair, we must state that this discovery should be
    attributed to Mr. Schiff. Dr. Jobert only elaborated on its consequences before the
    Academy of Medicine in order to deal the decisive blow against spirit table-rappers. One
    may find all the details in Revue Spirite of June 1859 – Auth.



                                             67

                              Chapter IV


but would not apply to all the other modes of communication.
Consequently, we conclude that its author has judged without
having seen, or without having seen everything sufficiently. It is
always lamentable that in addressing a subject they are unfamiliar
with, scientists hurry to give explanations that the facts themselves
belie. Their own knowledge should make them more circumspect
in their judgments, especially when such knowledge broadens the
boundaries of the unknown.
       42. THE PHYSICAL CAUSE THEORY: From this point
on, we will leave behind the theories of absolute denial. Having
admitted the reality of the phenomena, the first thought that
naturally occurred to those who witnessed them was to attribute
the movements to magnetism, electricity or the action of some kind
of fluid, i.e., to an exclusively material and physical cause. There
was nothing unreasonable about this theory and it would have
prevailed if the phenomena had been limited to purely mechanical
effects. A circumstance that even seemed to corroborate it in certain
cases was the increase in the phenomena’s power because of the
number of individuals present in that each one of them could be
seen as an element of a human electric battery. As we have already
stated, what characterizes a true theory is its ability to explain all
the facts. If one single fact contradicts it, it is because it is wrong,
incomplete or too rigid – which is what applied in this case. The
movements and raps revealed signs of intelligence in that they
obeyed a will and responded to thought. Thus, they had to have
an intelligent cause behind them, and since the effect ceased to be
merely physical, the cause itself had to be something other than
physical. Therefore, the theory of an exclusive action by a material
agent was abandoned and now only resurfaces among those who
make an a priori judgment without having seen anything. Hence,
the crucial point is to attest to an intelligent action, a point that
can convince whomever wants to make the effort to observe.

                                  68

                               Theories


       43. THE REFLECTION THEORY: Once it was
recognized that an intelligent action was involved, the source of
that intelligence still had to be determined. It was thought that
it might be the intelligence of the medium or the participants
themselves, which was then reflected like light or sound waves.
This was quite possible and only experience would finally be able
to provide the last word on the matter. Before long, however, we
noticed that this theory was completely removed from any purely
materialistic idea; in order for the intelligence of the participants
to be reproduced indirectly, it would be necessary to admit the
existence in human beings of a principle that was independent of
their organism.
       If the thought that was expressed were always that of the
participants, the reflection theory could be confirmed. But even
reduced to such a proportion, wouldn’t the phenomenon be of
greatest interest? Wouldn’t it be remarkable if thought could
resound within an inert object and translate itself into motion and
sound? Wouldn’t there be something about it that might arouse the
curiosity of scholars? Then why do those who exhaust themselves
searching for a nerve fiber disdain this subject so much?
       As we have stated, only experience could provide the last
word concerning this theory, and experience has disproved it
instead, because in each instance and by the most positive facts
it has shown that the thought thus expressed might not only be
foreign to the thought of the participants, but is often completely
contrary to it. This contradicts all preconceived ideas and frustrates
all expectations. In fact, when I think ‘white’ but receive ‘black’ in
response, I cannot believe that the response is actually my own.
Some opponents find support in cases where the thought that is
expressed and the thought of the participants are identical. But
what does that prove except that the participants can think like
the communicating intelligence? We do not mean that they must


                                 69

                              Chapter IV


always be different from each other. During a conversation, when
the person you are speaking with expresses a thought similar to
your own, do you say that his or her thought had come from you?
It only requires a few contrary and well proven examples to show
that this theory is incomplete.
       Furthermore, how can one use the thought reflection theory
to explain the writing produced by persons who do not even
know how to write; responses of the highest philosophical reach
expressed through illiterate individuals; answers given to mental,
non-verbal questions or formulated in a language unknown by the
medium, or a thousand other facts that can leave no doubt as to
the independence of the manifesting intelligence? Any contrary
opinion could only result from a deficient observation.
       If the presence of an outside intelligence is mentally
proven by the nature of the responses, it is physically proven by
the phenomenon of direct writing; i.e., writing that is produced
spontaneously without a pen or pencil, without being touched and
in spite of all the precautions taken to avoid any kind of trickery. The
intelligent character of this phenomenon cannot be put in doubt;
thus, there is more than simple fluidic action involved. Moreover,
the spontaneity of the thought that is expressed independently of
all expectations and apart from any formulated question prevents
it from being seen as a reflection of the participants’ thoughts.
       The reflection theory is quite unflattering in certain cases.
When a group of honest individuals in a meeting unexpectedly
receives a grossly revolting communication, attributing it to one
of them would be committing a serious indelicacy, and everyone
would no doubt promptly repudiate the notion (See The Spirits’
Book, sect. XVI of the Introduction).
       44. THE COLLECTIVE SOUL THEORY: This is a
variation of the preceding one. According to this theory, it is only
the medium’s soul that actually expresses itself, but it identifies

                                  70

                                           Theories


itself with the souls of many other persons, who may be present or
absent, thereby forming a collective whole that brings together the
aptitudes, intelligence and knowledge of each person. However,
the brochure that divulges this theory, entitled La lumière8, seems
to be in a style that is rather obscure. We must confess at having
comprehended little of what we read, and only cite this work from
memory. Besides, this theory represents more of an individual
opinion – like so many others – and it has won few adherents. Emah
Tirpsé is the name used by the author to designate the collective
being, whom he represents. His motto is: there is nothing hidden
that must not be revealed. This proposition, however, is obviously
wrong, since there are an infinite number of things that humans
cannot and must not know about. One would be presumptuous
indeed to claim to be able to penetrate all the secrets of God.
        45. SOMNAMBULISM THEORY: This theory used
to have many adherents and even now it still has a few. Like
the Collective Soul theory, this one holds that all the intelligent
communications proceed from the soul or spirit of the mediums
themselves. However, in order to explain how mediums can address
subjects that are outside their realm of understanding, rather than
considering them as having a collective soul, it attributes it to a
momentary over-stimulation of the mediums’ mental faculties; in
other words, a sort of somnambulistic or ecstatic state that excites
and develops their intelligence. One cannot deny that, in certain
cases, such a cause could have an influence, but it would be quite
enough to have seen how the majority of these mediums operate in
order to understand that this theory cannot resolve all the cases –
it is the exception rather than the rule. It could be the answer if
mediums always possessed the air of a visionary or an ecstatic, an

appearance that they could simulate perfectly if they wanted to
put on a comedy show. But where does the inspiration come from
when mediums write like a machine and without any awareness of
what they are receiving, without any emotion, without being at all
concerned with what they are doing, all in an entirely distracted
manner – even laughing and dealing with other matters at the
same time? One might understand the over-excitation of thought,
but not how it could enable mediums to write who do not know
how to, and even less when the communications are transmitted
through raps or with the help of a planchette or basket. Over the
course of this work, we shall see what cause must be attributed
to the influence of the mediums’ ideas. But the cases in which
the outside intelligence is revealed through uncontestable signs
are so numerous and obvious that they can leave no doubt as to
their true origin. The error of most of the theories that appeared
at the beginning of Spiritism lay in the drawing of generalized
conclusions from a few isolated incidents.
       46. THE PESSIMISTIC, DIABOLICAL OR DEMONIAC
THEORY: Here we shall enter upon another order of ideas. Having
proven the intervention of an outside intelligence, it was then
necessary to try to understand its nature. The easiest means would
undoubtedly have been to simply ask it, but certain individuals
did not see this as a sufficient guarantee; instead, they preferred
to see all the manifestations as the work of the Devil. According
to them, only the Devil or demons could communicate in such a
manner. Although this theory is little-accepted nowadays, it enjoyed
some credit for awhile in virtue of the special character of those
who sought to make it prevail. We would point out, ironically, that
the adherents of the demoniac theory should not be regarded as
being among Spiritism’s adversaries, but rather just the opposite.
Whether they are demons or angels, the beings who communicate
are always incorporeal; thus, admitting the manifestation of demons

                                72

                               Theories


is the same as admitting the possibility of communicating with the
invisible world, or at least with a segment of that world.
       As unreasonable as it may be, believing that such
communications are the exclusive product of demons would not
appear to be impossible as long as spirits were considered as beings
who were created outside the scope of humankind. However,
since we know that spirits are only the souls of those who have
already lived, this theory has lost all its prestige, and, one might
add, all likelihood of being true, for it would mean that all such
souls are demons, whether they are the souls of fathers, children
or friends, and that we ourselves will become demons when we
die. Consequently, to many people it is not a very flattering or
consoling doctrine. It would be very difficult to convince a mother
that a dear child whom she has lost, and who, after death, came
to provide her with proof of its affection and identity, was actually
a fiend instead. It is true that among spirits there are those who
are quite evil and who deserve no more than to be called demons,
and for a very simple reason: there are humans who are quite evil
and death brings them no immediate improvement. The issue is
to know whether it is only they who can communicate with us. To
those who believe so, we would propose the following questions:
       1) Are there both good and evil spirits?
       2) Is God more powerful than evil spirits – or demons, if
you prefer?
       3) Affirming that only evil spirits communicate is the same
as saying that good spirits cannot. If such is the case, then it either
happens by God’s will or against it. If it is against God’s will, then
evil spirits are more powerful than God. If it is by God’s will, then
why, in all the divine goodness, wouldn’t God allow good spirits to
communicate in order to offset the influence of the others?
       4) What proof can you give of the impossibility of good
spirits to communicate?


                                  73

                                          Chapter IV


       5) When we confront you with the wisdom displayed by
some of the communications, you respond that the Devil uses
every sort of mask in order to better seduce us. We recognize the
fact that there are hypocritical spirits who coat their language
with the varnish of wisdom, but would you hold that ignorance
can mimic true wisdom and that an evil nature can imitate virtue
without revealing the fraud?
       6) If only the Devil can communicate, and since he is the
enemy of both God and humans, then why do spirits recommend
praying to God, submitting to the divine will, enduring the
tribulations of life without complaining, not pursuing honor or
wealth, and practicing charity and all the maxims of Christ; in
a word, doing everything that is necessary to destroy the Devil’s
empire? If it is the Devil who offers all these counsels, we must
agree that no matter how cunning he may be, he would have to be
quite incompetent to supply ammunition against himself.9
       7) If spirits communicate, it is because God allows it. Since
both good and evil communications are received, isn’t it more
logical to think that God allows the evil ones to test us and the
others to offer us wise counsel?
       8) What would you think of a father who left his children
at the mercy of pernicious examples and counsels, who withdrew
from them, who prohibited them from seeking out individuals
who could turn them from evil? Should we believe that God, who
is goodness par excellence, would do what a good father or any
other person would not?
       9) The Church affirms the authenticity of certain
manifestations of the Virgin and other saints in the form of

9
    This question is addressed in The Spirits’ Book (Nos. 128 ff ). However, with respect to this
    subject, as well as everything that concerns religion, we recommend the booklet entitled
    Lettre d’un catholique sur le spiritisme by Dr. Grand, former French consul, along with what
    we ourselves will publish under the title LES CONTRADICTEURS DU SPIRITISME au point de
    vue de la religion, de la science et du matérialisme – Auth.



                                               74

                                           Theories


apparitions, visions, oral communications, etc. Doesn’t this belief
contradict the doctrine that only demons communicate?
       We believe that some persons have professed this theory in
good faith, but we also believe that many have done so for the sole
purpose of avoiding being concerned with such matters because of
the evil communications which everyone is subject to receiving. By
stating that only the Devil manifests, they wish to scare people as
they would a child: “Don’t touch that; you’ll get burned!” Perhaps
the intention is praiseworthy but it does not meet its objective,
since prohibiting something only serves to arouse one’s curiosity,
and the fear of the Devil only stops a few people. In fact, most of
them would actually like to see him, if for no other reason than to
see what he looks like, and they would be amazed to find out that
he is not as ugly as they had thought he would be.
       Mightn’t there be a further motive behind this theory
that communications derive exclusively from the Devil himself?
There are persons who regard all who do not think as they do
to be in error. Isn’t it possible that those who hold that spirit
communications are the work of demons are afraid that spirits
might not agree with them, especially on issues concerning this
world rather than those concerning the other? Since they cannot
deny the facts, they try to present them in as frightening a manner
as possible. This method, however, does not produce any better
results than any of the others, and where fear of the ridiculous is
powerless, it is best to allow things to run their course.
       A Muslim who heard a spirit speak against certain laws of the
Koran would surely believe it was an evil spirit. The same would
apply to a Jew concerning certain practices of the Law of Moses. As
for Catholics, we heard one of them state that the communicating
spirit was the Devil because he thought differently concerning the
temporal power10, even though this spirit only preached charity,
10
     That is, the power of the Pope to become involved in and decide secular matters – Tr.



                                               75

                             Chapter IV


tolerance, love for one’s neighbor and abnegation of worldly affairs,
all in harmony with the maxims proclaimed by Christ.
       Since spirits are but human souls, and, as such, not perfect,
it stands to reason that there are equally imperfect spirits whose
character is reflected in their communications. It is undeniable
that there are evil, cunning and profoundly hypocritical spirits
whom we must guard ourselves against. However, simply because
there are perverse individuals in this world, would that be any
reason for us to run from societal life? God has given us reason
and discernment for judging both spirits and humans. The best
way to avoid the possible inconveniences that Spiritist practice
may present is not to prohibit them but rather to clarify them.
An imaginary fear can only make a momentary impression and
it will not affect everybody, while, on the other hand, a clearly
demonstrated reality is indeed comprehensible to all.
       47. THE OPTIMISTIC THEORY: Alongside the theories
that only see spirit phenomena as being the work of demons, there
are others that see them only as the work of good spirits. Such
theories start from the principle that, being released from matter,
the soul is now free of any kind of veil and must therefore be
possessed of supreme knowledge and wisdom. However, this blind
confidence in the absolute superiority of the beings of the invisible
world has been a source of numerous deceptions for many people.
At their own expense, they have had to learn to distrust certain
spirits, just as they have learned to distrust certain individuals.
       48. THE UNI-SPIRIT OR MONO-SPIRIT THEORY: A
variety of the optimistic theory is the belief that there is one sole
spirit who communicates with humans, and that this spirit is Christ,
the protector of the earth. However, when communications are of
the lowest triviality, of a revolting grossness, full of malevolence
and malice, it would be impious and profane to suppose that they


                                 76

                              Theories


could have emanated from the Spirit of Goodness par excellence.
If those who believe in this theory had received only impeccable
communications, we could possibly accept their illusion. But most of
them declare that they have received extremely evil communications,
trying to explain them away as a test to which the Spirit of Goodness
has submitted them by dictating absurdities to them. Thus, while
some attribute all communications to the Devil, who is able to
make good statements in order to tempt them, others believe that
Jesus is the only one who manifests himself, but that he can make
evil statements in order to test them. What shall decide between
these two very diverse opinions? Common sense and experience.
We cite experience because it is impossible for those who adopt such
exclusive ideas to have sufficiently verified everything.
       When we confront them with cases of identification that
attest to the presence of relatives, friends or acquaintances through
written, visual and other means of communication, they respond
that it is always the same spirit: the Devil, according to some, or
Christ, according to others – who assumes all forms. But they give
no reason as to why other spirits cannot communicate, or why
the Spirit of Truth would come to fool us under false appearances
in order to deceive a poor mother by pretending to be the child
whom she is mourning. Reason refuses to admit that the holiest
of all spirits would come to put on such a dark comedy act.
Furthermore, doesn’t denying the possibility of any other form
of communication take from Spiritism its kindest characteristic:
the consoling of the afflicted? We would simply state that such a
theory is irrational and could not endure a serious examination.
      49. THE MULTI-SPIRIT OR POLYSPIRIT THEORY:
All the theories that we have examined, including the ones that
deny spirit phenomena, are based on certain incomplete or badly
interpreted observations. If a house is red on one side and white
on the other, whoever had seen only one side or the other would

                                 77

                              Chapter IV


affirm that it was either only red or only white, and would thus
be both right and wrong at the same time. But whoever had seen
both sides of the house would say that it is red and white and
would be the only one aware of the real truth. The same applies
regarding opinions about Spiritism: they can be correct concerning
certain aspects but wrong if they generalize what is only a part
by regarding as a rule what is actually only an exception, or
interpreting as a whole what is really only a part. That is why we
have stated that those who desire to seriously study this science
must observe it a great deal and for a long time, because only
time will enable them to ascertain the details, notice the delicate
nuances and observe an infinite number of characteristic facts that
will shine like luminous rays of light. However, if they remain on
the surface, they will expose themselves to making a premature
and thus erroneous judgment.
       Let us take a look at the general results which we have arrived
at by making a complete observation of the subject, and which as
of today have formulated the belief, so to speak, in the universality
of spirits, for all the above-listed restrictive theories are no more
than isolated opinions:
       1) Spirit phenomena are produced by extra-corporeal
intelligences, that is, by spirits.
       2) Spirits comprise the invisible world and are everywhere;
they populate space to infinity; there are spirits who constantly
surround us and with whom we are always in contact.
       3) Spirits continuously act both upon the physical and
mental worlds, and they are one of the powers of nature.
       4) Spirits were not created as a separate class of entities: they
are the souls of those who have lived either on the earth or on
other worlds, and who have shed their corporeal envelope. Hence,
it follows that the souls of men and women are incarnate spirits,
who at death become spirits once again.


                                  78

                              Theories


       5) There are spirits of every degree of goodness and malice,
of wisdom and ignorance.
       6) They are subject to the law of progress and all may achieve
perfection, but depending on how they employ their free will, they
will achieve it in a short time or a long time, according to their
own efforts and volition.
       7) They are happy or unhappy, depending on the amount
of good or evil they did during their lifetime and the degree of
development they achieved; perfect and unalloyed happiness is
only attained by those who have reached the highest degree of
purification.
       8) Under certain circumstances, all spirits can manifest
themselves to humans, and the number of those who can
communicate is unlimited.
       9) Spirits communicate through mediums, who serve as
their instruments and interpreters.
       10) One can recognize whether spirits are more evolved
or less evolved by their language: good spirits only offer good
counsel and say only good things – everything attests to their
advancement; evil spirits deceive and all their words bear the
stamp of imperfection and ignorance.
       The various degrees through which spirits pass comprise the
Spirit Hierarchy (The Spirits’ Book, pt. 2, chap. 1, no. 100). The
study of this classification system is indispensable for evaluating
both the nature of the spirits who manifest and their good and
bad qualities.
       50. MATERIAL SOUL THEORY: This theory consists
solely of a particular opinion about the essential nature of the
soul, according to which the soul and the perispirit are not distinct
from each other, or, rather, the perispirit is the soul itself, which
is gradually purified through several transmigrations like alcohol
is purified through several distillations. In the Spiritist Doctrine,

                                 79

                              Chapter IV


however, the perispirit is considered as simply being the fluidic
envelope of the soul or spirit. Since the perispirit is a type of
matter, albeit highly etherealized, then for the theory in question
the soul would also be of a nature that is more material or less so,
according to its degree of purification.
       This principle does not invalidate any of the fundamental
principles of the Spiritist Doctrine, since nothing changes in
relation to the soul’s destiny. The conditions for its future happiness
are exactly the same, with the soul and perispirit forming a whole
known as the spirit, like the germ and perisperm form a unity
known as the fruit. The entire matter may be reduced to regarding
the whole as homogenous instead of being composed of two
distinct parts.
       As can be seen, this issue is of little consequence and we
would not have addressed it at all if we had not encountered
persons who were inclined to see a new school where, in fact,
there was nothing more than a simple interpretation of words.
This theory is quite restricted, but even if it were not, it would
no more mean that there is a schism among Spiritists than the
two theories about the emission or the undulations of light would
indicate a division among physicists. Those who want to go their
separate ways over such a childish issue prove that they give more
importance to accessories than to the principle itself, and they are
incited to dissension by spirits who cannot be good, for good spirits
would never want to sow the seeds of acrimony and discord. For
that reason, we have urged all true Spiritists to guard themselves
against such suggestions and not to attach a greater importance
to certain details than they deserve – the core is what is essential.
       Nevertheless, we believe we should mention a few words
about what those who hold the soul and the perispirit as being
two distinct principles base their opinion upon. It is based upon
the teaching of spirits themselves, who have never differed in this


                                  80

                               Theories


respect. We are alluding to enlightened spirits, however, because
among spirits in general there are many who do not know any
more, and even many who know much less, than human beings
know, while the opposing theory is a human conception. We
neither invented nor dreamed up the existence of the perispirit in
order to explain spirit phenomena. Its existence was revealed to us
by the Spirits themselves and observation confirmed it (The Spirits’
Book, no. 93). It was further supported by studying the sensations
of spirits (ibid. no. 257), and especially in the phenomena
involving tangible apparitions, which for others would imply
the solidification and subsequent desaggregation of the elements
comprising the soul and, consequently, its disorganization.
       Furthermore, it would be necessary to admit that such matter
[that of apparitions], which could become perceptible to our senses,
is the intelligent principle itself, which would be no more rational
than confusing the body with the soul or clothing with the body.
As for the inmost nature of the soul, we know nothing. When we
state that it is immaterial, we must understand the term in a relative
and not in an absolute sense, because absolute immateriality would
be nothingness – the soul or spirit is something, however. What we
mean to say, therefore, is that its essence is so highly evolved that
there is absolutely no analogy to what we call matter per se, and
that is why for us it is immaterial (ibid. nos. 23 and 82).
       51. Following is the response by one spirit with regards to
the matter:
       “What some call the perispirit is the same as what others
call the fluidic material envelope. So that I may make myself
understood in the most logical manner, I would state that this
fluid is the perfectibility of the senses, the extension of both sight
and thought. But I am referring to highly evolved spirits.
       “As for imperfect spirits, they are still completely impregnated
with earthly fluids; thus, they are matter as you understand it.

                                  81

                              Chapter IV


Consequently, they experience hunger, cold, etc., experiences
that cannot touch high order spirits, since the earthly fluids have
already been distilled out of their thought, i.e., their soul. In order
to progress, the soul always requires an agent, without which it
would appear to be nothing to you, or better, you would not be able
to conceive of it. We errant spirits regard the perispirit as the agent
through which we communicate with you, whether indirectly by
means of your body or perispirit, or directly with your soul; hence,
the infinite variety of both mediums and communications.
       “As for the scientific standpoint, i.e., the very essence of
the perispirit itself, that is another subject. First, you should
understand its logical possibility. That would leave a discussion
on the nature of the fluids, which is inexplicable for now, since
science does not yet know enough about them, but will finally
understand them if it wishes to keep pace with Spiritism. The
perispirit may vary and change infinitely, whereas the soul is the
intelligence – its nature does not change. Do not go any farther
with this subject, for it is a question that cannot yet be explained.
Don’t you realize that I too am investigating the matter as you
are? You are researching the perispirit, while we are currently
researching the soul. Therefore, wait.”
                                                           Lamennais

      Thus, spirits whom we may regard as advanced have not
yet been able to probe the nature of the soul, so how could we
ourselves possibly do so? It would therefore be a waste of time
to scrutinize the beginning of things, which, as The Spirits’ Book
(nos. 17 and 49) teaches, belongs to the secrets of God. To intend
to discover through Spiritism what is still beyond the reach of
humankind in general would be to divert it from its true objective;
it would be like a child who wanted to know as much as a grown-
up. The essential thing is for humans to apply Spiritism to their


                                  82

                              Theories


moral perfection process; anything else is mere sterile curiosity and
almost always implies pride, which if satisfied, would not enable
them to advance even one step. The sole means of advancing is by
morally improving ourselves.
       The Spirits who dictated the book that bears their name
have proven their own wisdom by respecting the limits that God
will not allow them to exceed concerning the beginning of things,
leaving to theorizing and presumptuous spirits the responsibility of
premature and erroneous hypotheses, which are more fascinating
than serious, and which someday will fall before the impact of
reason like so many others that have arisen from the human mind.
They have only stated what is truly necessary so that men and
women may comprehend the future that awaits them and thus
be encouraged to practice goodness. (See following, in the second
sect. of chap. I: The Action of Spirits upon Matter)

        The Action of Spirits
           upon Matter
        52. Now that we have rejected the materialist theory
because it is condemned both by reason and the facts, we must
now determine whether or not the soul, after death, can manifest
itself to the living. Thus reduced to its simplest expression, the
issue becomes very easy to address. First, we must ask why the
intelligent beings, who, to some extent, live amongst us (although
invisible by nature), could not somehow make their presence felt
in some manner. Common sense tells us that there is nothing
completely impossible about the idea, which in itself is at least
something to start with. Moreover, this belief has the acceptance
of all cultures in its favor because we find that it has been held
everywhere and in all ages. In addition, an intuitive idea could not
have become so widespread or have survived down through time
without having some reason behind it. It is also sanctioned by the
testimony of the Scriptures and the Church Fathers, and it took
the skepticism and materialism of our own century to relegate it to
the area of superstitious ideas. Therefore, if we are in error, those
authorities are equally so.

                                 87

                             Chapter I


       But these are only philosophical considerations. One
cause above all others has contributed to fortifying doubt in an
era that is as positive as ours, in which everyone needs to know
everything, and in which everyone wants to know the why and
how of all things. That cause is ignorance concerning the nature of
spirits and of the means through which they are able to manifest
themselves. Once this understanding is acquired, the fact of such
manifestations presents nothing surprising and falls into line with
the order of natural events.
        53. The idea that people normally have about spirits makes
the phenomenon of spirit manifestations seem incomprehensible
at first. Such a phenomenon cannot occur without the action of
a spirit upon matter, and that is why those who regard spirits as
completely lacking in matter ask, with apparently good reason,
how they can act physically upon it. This is precisely the error,
however, for a spirit is not an abstraction but rather a defined,
limited and circumscribed being. A spirit while incarnated in a
body comprises the soul; when it leaves the body behind at death,
however, it is not deprived of its entire envelope. All spirits have
told us that they retain the human form and, in fact, when they
appear to us, it is in this form that we recognize them.
        Let us closely examine the moment in which they have
just left life behind. They find themselves in a state of confusion;
everything is unclear around them; they see their own whole or
mutilated body – depending on the type of death; on the other
hand, they feel themselves alive; something tells them that that
body lying there belongs to them, but they cannot understand
how they can be separate from it. They continue to see themselves
in their previous shape, and this sight provokes a strange delusion
in some spirits for a certain length of time: they regard themselves
as still among the living. They lack enough experience with this
new state to be fully convinced of the reality of the situation.

                            The Action of Spirits upon Matter


When this first moment of confusion dissipates, however, the
body seems like old, worn out clothing from which they have freed
themselves and no longer want. They feel lighter and relieved of a
burden. They no longer suffer from any physical pain and they are
delighted at being able to rise and move through space, as they had
already done many times in their dreams when they were alive.11
Nevertheless, in spite of the lack of a body, they notice they have
retained their personality. They have a form that neither bothers
nor embarrasses them; finally, they are conscious of their Self and
their individuality. What are we to conclude from all this? That
the soul does not leave everything behind in the grave, but takes
something along with it instead.
        54. Numerous observations and irrefutable facts, which we
shall deal with later, have demonstrated that human beings consist
of three components: 1) the soul or spirit, the intelligent principle
in which the moral sense resides; 2) the body, the material and
dense envelope, which the spirit temporarily uses as a garment for
fulfilling certain providential designs; 3) the perispirit, the fluidic,
semi-material envelope, which serves as the link between the soul
and the body.
        Death is the destruction, or better, the desaggregation of
the dense envelope that the soul abandons. The other envelope
detaches itself and accompanies the soul, which therefore always
has an envelope. Although fluidic, ethereal, vaporous and invisible
to us in its normal state, this latter envelope is also material despite
the fact that until now we have been unable to capture it and
submit it to analysis.
11
     Those who refer to what we have stated in The Spirits’ Book concerning dreams and the
     state of the spirit during sleep (nos. 400-418) will understand that the dreams that almost
     all of them have had, in which they see themselves traveling through space as though
     they were flying, are a memory of the sensation experienced by their spirit during their
     emancipation from the body, when they take with them only the fluidic body, the same
     one they will retain after death. Such dreams can thus give us an idea about the state of
     the spirit when it has freed itself from the shackles that bound it to the earth. – Auth.

       This second envelope of the soul, or perispirit, therefore
exists during corporeal life itself. It is the intermediary for all
the sensations perceived by the spirit, and through which the
spirit transmits its will to the outside world and acts upon
the body’s physical organs. To make a material analogy, the
perispirit is the electrical wiring that serves for the reception
and transmission of thought. Finally, this mysterious and
imperceptible agent known also as the neural fluid – which
performs such an important role in the organic workings of the
body – is still not sufficiently taken into consideration regarding
physiological and pathological phenomena. By taking only
the ponderable material element into consideration, medical
science deprives itself of a permanent cause of action in its study
of the facts. However, this is not the proper place to examine
the issue and we need only remember that knowing about the
perispirit is the key to a host of problems that have until now
been unexplainable.
       The perispirit is not one of those hypotheses in which science
seeks recourse in order to explain a given fact. Its existence was
not only revealed by the Spirits, but has also been confirmed by
observation, as we will have the occasion to demonstrate further
on. For now, however, and in order not to anticipate issues that we
will have to deal with later, we will limit ourselves to stating that
whether during its union with the body or after its separation from
it, the soul is never separated from its perispirit.
       55. We have already stated elsewhere that the spirit
is a flame, a spark.12 This applies to the spirit per se as the
intellectual and moral principle, but we do not know how to
assign a specific shape to it. However, no matter what its degree
of evolution, it is always clothed with an envelope or perispirit,

                               The Action of Spirits upon Matter


whose nature becomes more and more etherealized as it purifies
and raises itself in the spirit hierarchy.13 Thus, the idea of form
is for us so inseparable from the idea of spirit that we cannot
conceive of one without the other. The perispirit therefore
comprises an integral component of the spirit, just as the body
comprises an integral part of the human being. However, the
perispirit is not the spirit, just as the body by itself is not the
human being, because the perispirit does not think; rather, it is
for the spirit what the body is for the individual: the agent or
instrument of activity.
       56. The form of the perispirit is the human form, and
when it appears to us it is usually in the same form by which we
knew the spirit during its physical life. That is why we might
believe that the perispirit, even when disconnected from all the
components of the body, must have somehow modeled itself
after the body and retained its form afterwards. Such does not
appear to be the case, however. Except for some differences in
detail and the organic modifications that are required for the
environment in which the being must live, the human form is
the same for all inhabitants on all globes – at least according to
the Spirits – and it is also the form of all discarnate spirits, who
only possess the perispirit. It is also the same form by which the
angels or pure spirits have been represented down through the
ages. Therefore, we must conclude that the human form is the
typical form for all human beings no matter what degree of the
hierarchy they belong to. However, the perispirit’s subtle matter
is not as persistent or inflexible as the body’s compact matter.
We might say that it is flexible and expandable, and that is why
the form it assumes – though an exact copy of the body – is not
absolute. It is molded according to the will of the spirit, who can

     See nos. 100 ff. in The Spirits’ Book – Tr.



                                                   91

                               Chapter I


give it any appearance it wants to, whereas the physical envelope
confronts it with invincible resistance.
       Disentangled from the obstacle that had repressed it, the
perispirit expands, contracts or transforms itself; in other words,
it lends itself to all sorts of metamorphoses, according to the will
that acts upon it. It is thanks to this property of its fluidic envelope
that the spirit can make itself recognizable when necessary by
taking on the exact appearance that it had during its physical life,
and even display the very same physical defects that could serve
as signs for recognizing it.
       Hence, spirits are beings like us, comprising a population
around us that is invisible in its normal state – we say normal state
because, as we shall see, this invisibility is not absolute.
       57. Let us return to the perispirit for now since it is
essential for the explanation we are about to give. We have stated
that although the perispirit is fluidic, it is nevertheless comprised
of a type of matter that makes tangible apparitions possible, a
matter to which we shall also return later. Under the influence
of certain mediums, we have seen hands appear that bear all the
properties of living hands – warmth, tangibility, the resistance
typical of a solid object, and the ability to hold onto onlookers –
only to suddenly vanish like a shadow. The intelligent action of
such hands, which obviously obey a will in performing certain
movements (even playing tunes on a musical instrument), proves
that they are a visible component of an intelligent invisible being.
Their tangibility, their warmth and the sensorial impression they
produce, even so far as to leave visible marks on the skin (as
we have witnessed), to deal painful slaps or to delicately caress,
prove that they are comprised of some kind of matter. Moreover,
their ability to instantaneously disappear shows that this matter
is extremely subtle and behaves like certain substances that can
alternately pass from the solid to the fluidic state, and vice-versa.

                                  92

                    The Action of Spirits upon Matter


       58. The inmost nature of the spirit per se, that is, of the
thinking being, is entirely unknown to us. It only reveals itself
through its actions and these actions can only impress our senses by
means of an intermediate type of matter. Consequently, the spirit
needs matter in order to act upon matter. Its direct instrument
for doing so is the perispirit, just as an individual’s is the body,
and as we have just seen, the perispirit itself is indeed comprised
of matter. As its intermediary agent, it has the universal fluid,
which is a kind of vehicle upon which it acts, as we ourselves act
upon the air in order to produce certain effects through dilation,
compression, propulsion or vibration.
       Regarded in this way, the fact that the spirit can act upon
matter is easy to accept. One may thereby understand that all
effects resulting from such action belong to the order of natural
events and have nothing miraculous about them. They only
appear supernatural because the cause behind them is unknown;
however, once the cause is known, they cease to be miraculous, for
their cause can be found entirely in the semi-material properties
of the perispirit. This is all to be treated as a new order of things,
which a new law has come to explain, and at which, before long,
no one will be amazed, just as no one nowadays is astonished by
long-distance communication, which takes only a few minutes by
using electricity.
        59. One may perhaps ask how a spirit, with the aid of such
subtle matter, is able to act upon heavy and compact objects, to
lift tables, etc. It would certainly not take a scientist to raise such
an objection, because, without even considering the unknown
properties that this new agent must possess, haven’t we seen
similar examples with our own eyes? Hasn’t industry discovered
the most powerful motive forces in the most rarified gases and
the most imponderable fluids? When we see air topple buildings,
steam pull enormous objects, gasified blasting-powder blow

stones into the air, and electricity split trees and perforate walls,
is there anything so strange in accepting the fact that the spirit,
by employing its perispirit, can lift a table, especially when it is
understood that this perispirit can make itself visible, tangible
and behave like a solid object?

          Physical Manifestations
            and Turning Tables
       60. Physical manifestations are those that result in effects
that are perceptible to the senses, such as noises and the movement
and displacement of solid objects. Some are spontaneous, i.e.,
independent of any human will, while others can be artificially
induced. To start with, we will only consider the latter.
       The simplest effect, one of the first to be observed, is
the circular movement imparted to a table. This effect may be
produced by using any other object as well, but since a table is the
one that is used most often because it is the most convenient, the
name table turning has been the prevalent designation for this type
of phenomenon.
       When we stated that this effect was one of the first to be
observed, we were referring to modern times14, because all kinds
of such manifestations have certainly been known about since
antiquity – it could not have been otherwise. Since they are
effects of nature, they would have had to have been produced

in all ages. Tertullian15 made clear reference to turning and
talking tables.
       For some time, this phenomenon was the curious
entertainment at various salons, but later went out of fashion
and was replaced by other distractions because it really did only
amount to a distraction. There were two reasons for abandoning
the turning tables: for the frivolous, it was fashion, which rarely
allows for the enjoyment of the same entertainment for two
winters; however, this particular variety actually provided for three
or four! For earnest individuals and observers, the reason was more
serious, however – they abandoned the turning tables in order to
occupy themselves with the much more important consequences
that resulted from them. They left behind the first stages of using
the alphabet in order to enter the science; hence the whole secret
for this apparent abandonment, about which the scoffers have
made such noise.
       Whatever the case may be, the turning tables will always
represent the starting point for the Spiritist Doctrine, and that
is why we must give them a much more in-depth treatment.
By presenting spirit phenomena in their simplest expression,
studying what causes them will become easier, and once a theory
is established, it will give us the key to more complex effects.
       61. In order to produce this particular phenomenon, the
participation of one or more individuals gifted with a special
aptitude is required. These individuals are called mediums. The
number of other participants does not matter, except that amongst
them there may be a few who are mediums but who are still unaware
of the fact. As for the participants who have no mediumistic
abilities, their presence will have no effect, or may even be more

harmful than useful because of the mental disposition that such
persons often display.
       In this respect, mediums display lesser or greater degrees
of power in their ability to produce the phenomenon, and,
consequently, produce effects that are quite pronounced or less
so. One very powerful medium alone can almost always produce
more than twenty less powerful ones together, and it is enough for
such a medium to have barely placed his or her hands upon the
table for it to instantly begin to move, levitate, turn, jump about
or spin violently.
       62. There are no outward signs of mediumship and only
experience can make it apparent. During a meeting where such
an experience is desired, all that is required is for everyone to sit
around a table and place their hands flat upon it without pressure
or muscular movement. Since the causes of the phenomenon
were unknown in the beginning, numerous precautions were
taken that were later seen to be completely useless; for example,
the alternating seating of males and females or the joining of the
participants’ little fingers in order to form an unbroken chain. This
latter precaution seemed necessary because it was believed that
there was some sort of electric current involved, but experience
later showed it was useless. The only truly obligatory condition
is one of concentration, absolute silence and, especially, patience
when the effect is slow in coming. The effect can appear in just a
few minutes or it may take a half hour or even a whole hour; it
depends on the mediumistic power of the participants.
       63. Let us add that the shape of the table and the material
from which it is made, the presence of metals, silk in the
participants’ clothing, days, times, darkness or light etc., make no
difference, nor do rain or good weather. Only the weight of the
table itself might be of some importance, but only in cases in which


                                  97

                              Chapter II


the mediumistic power is not sufficient to move it. However, in
other cases, one person alone – even a child – is enough to lift a
two hundred pound table, while under less favorable conditions,
twelve individuals will not be able to budge even a small table.
       When the experiment is ready and when the phenomenon
begins to appear, it is very common to hear a small crackling noise
within the table and to feel it shudder just before it begins to move;
the table seems to struggle to break free from the floor. Then, the
rotating movement begins and may accelerate to such a degree that
the participants find themselves hard pressed to follow it. Once
the movement has begun, the participants can even move away
from the table, which will continue to move in various directions.
       At other times, the table tilts from one leg to another and
then softly returns to its natural position. Still at others, it rocks
back and forth and from side to side as if imitating the movement
of a ship. Finally, at other times – but requiring a very powerful
mediumship – the table rises completely up off the floor and
remains suspended in the air without any support, sometimes even
rising all the way to the ceiling so that one may pass beneath it.
Then, it descends lightly, flittering in the air like a sheet of paper,
or it might violently crash to the floor and break. This is obvious
proof that there has been no optical illusion.
      64. Another phenomenon that frequently occurs,
depending on the nature of the medium, is the production of
raps within the heart of the wood, inside it, without there first
having been any movement of the table itself. These raps, which
are sometimes quite weak and other times very loud, may equally
extend to other pieces of furniture in the room, to doors, walls
and the ceiling (we shall return to this matter shortly). When these
raps occur within the table, they cause a vibration that can be felt
with the fingers, and they become especially distinct when one
places one’s ear against the table.

  Intelligent Manifestations
       65. Regarding the incidents that we have just examined,
there is nothing in them that necessarily reveals the involvement of
some hidden power. Such effects might be explained perfectly well
as being the action of some kind of electric or magnetic current,
or some kind of fluid. This was, in fact, the first solution proposed
for the phenomena, and it could certainly have passed as being
very logical. This solution would have undoubtedly prevailed if
there had not been other facts proving its insufficiency. These
facts consisted in the evidence of intelligence displayed by the
phenomena. In addition, since every intelligent effect must have
an intelligent cause, it became obvious that, even accepting the
possibility of electricity or some other fluid being involved, another
cause was nevertheless present also. What could it be? What was
this intelligence? This is what further observations revealed.
       66. In order for a particular manifestation to show
intelligence, it does not have to be convincing, clever or wise. All
that is required is for it to act freely and voluntarily, revealing an
intention or corresponding to a thought. When we see a weathervane
moving under the force of the wind, we know that it is only obeying


                                 99

                             Chapter III


a mechanical impulse, but if we were to recognize signs of intent
in its movements, if it turned right or left and quickly or slowly in
obedience to our orders, we would have to admit that it was not
the weathervane itself that possessed intelligence, but rather that it
was obeying our own intelligence. That is exactly what happened
with the tables.
       67. We have seen a table move, rise into the air and produce
raps under the influence of one or several mediums, and the first
intelligent effect observed was that it obeyed the orders given to
it. Without moving about, the table alternately stood on the legs
that were indicated to it. Next, when it was square on the floor,
it produced a certain number of raps in response to particular
questions. At other times and without anyone touching it, the table
moved around the room by itself, going right or left, backward and
forward, and executing the various maneuvers that the participants
required of it. It was obvious that we could rule out all suspicion of
fraud; we accepted the unquestionable fidelity of the participants
because of their honorability and complete disinterestedness. We
will later address the issue of fraud, against which it is prudent to
guard oneself.
       68. By means of raps – mainly those produced within
the wood itself, which we have already addressed – even more
intelligent effects were observed, such as the imitation of the
beating of drums, the discharge of muskets by a file or platoon,
the firing of cannons, the rasping of a saw, the strike of a hammer,
the rhythms of certain arias, etc. An entire, vast field was therefore
opening up to investigation. It was further reasoned that if there
was in fact an invisible intelligence present, it might be able to
respond to questions, and, in fact, it really did respond with a yes
or a no, according to the number of agreed-upon raps produced.
Since these two responses were quite limiting, however, a system


                                 100

                       Intelligent Manifestations


was established using a certain number of raps to correspond to
each letter of the alphabet in order to form words and sentences.
       69. Since these occurrences were being repeated at will by
thousands of persons in every country, they could leave no doubt as
to their intelligent nature. It was then that a new theory was devised
for interpreting them, attributing the manifesting intelligence to
the medium, the observer or even the participants. However, the
difficulty was in explaining how this intelligence could be reflected
within the table itself and be communicated by means of raps.
Since the raps were not produced by the medium, then they must
be produced somehow by thought, but for thought to somehow be
able to produce such raps would be a more remarkable phenomenon
than all the incidents that had been observed. It did not take long
for experience to show that this theory was unacceptable. In fact,
the responses were very often shown to be completely opposite to
what the participants were thinking and beyond the scope of the
medium’s intellect; they were even given in languages unknown
by the medium or they pertained to facts unknown by any of
the participants. Such examples are so numerous that it is almost
impossible for anyone to be involved with spirit communications
without having witnessed them many times. We shall cite only one
example, which was related to us by an eye witness.
      70. On an Imperial French Navy ship stationed on the seas
around China, the entire crew, from the seamen to the captain,
entertained themselves with talking tables. They decided to evoke
the spirit of a lieutenant of the same vessel, who had died two years
previously. He responded, and after several communications that
surprised everybody, he used raps to say the following: “I beg of
you to pay the captain the sum of … (he indicated the amount),
which I owe him, and which I regret not having been able to
pay back before I died.” Nobody had even known about it. The


                                  101

                             Chapter III


captain himself had forgotten all about the debt, which was quite
small, by the way. However, upon checking his financial records,
he found the entry of the lieutenant’s debt in the exact amount
indicated. Now we must ask: whose thought could have possibly
been reflected in this instance?
       71. This art of communicating by the alphabetical system of
raps was eventually perfected, but it was always very cumbersome.
Nevertheless, some lengthy communications as well as a few
interesting revelations about the world of spirits were obtained.
This method gave rise to others, and hence the arrival of written
communications.
       The first communications of this type were obtained using
a miniature table to which a pencil was fitted and then placed
upon a sheet of paper. Under the medium’s influence, this tiny
table began to trace out a few letters, and then began to write
words and sentences. The process was gradually simplified by
using even smaller tables that were specially made to fit the hand,
followed by tiny baskets, cardboard boxes and, finally, simple
planchettes. The writing was fluent, rapid and easy – as if done by
hand – but it was realized later that all these objects only served as
extensions of the hand itself: simple pencil-holders, which could
be dispensed with. In fact, the medium’s own hand alone, impelled
involuntarily, could write under the influence of a spirit without
the concurrence of either the medium’s thought or will. From then
on, communications from beyond the grave presented no more
difficulty than every day correspondence among the living.
       We shall return to these different means later in order to
explain them in more detail, but we have given a quick outline
here in order to show the string of the events that led to the
realization that the phenomena entailed the involvement of
invisible intelligences, that is, spirits.

      Movements and Suspensions; Noises
       72. Having used both reasoning and phenomena to
demonstrate the existence of spirits, along with the possibility of
their being able to act upon matter, we must now determine how
their actions are produced and how they operate in order to move
tables and other inert objects.
       One idea that naturally occurred is the one that we held to
for a while. However, the Spirits contested it and provided us with
a completely different explanation – one we did not anticipate at
all; moreover, it is obvious that their explanation did not originate
with us (our original idea could have quite possibly been held by
others as well). As for the Spirits’ explanation, we do not believe
that it could have ever occurred to anyone else. It is certainly
easy to see how much more superior it is than our own, although

                                103

                               Chapter IV


it is also simpler because it offers a solution to numerous other
incidents that had no satisfactory explanation.
       73. Knowledge of the nature of spirits, their human form,
the semi-material properties of their perispirit, the mechanical
action they can exert upon matter, and the occurrence of apparitions
of fluidic and even tangible hands that could lift objects and carry
them, naturally led to our belief that a spirit simply used its hands
in order to turn a table and that it lifted it by using its arms. But
if that were so, then what was the need for mediums? Couldn’t
the spirit act by itself? Since mediums often rested their hands
upon the table in a position contrary to its movement, or did not
even place their hands upon it at all, they obviously could not aid
the spirit with any muscular movement. Let us first see what the
Spirits whom we asked had to say about the matter.
      74. The following responses were given by the Spirit St.
Louis and were later confirmed by others:
      1) Is the universal fluid an emanation of the Divinity?
      “No.”
      2) Is it a creation of the Divinity?
      “Everything has been created except God.”
      3) Is the universal fluid the universal element itself?
      “Yes, it is the elementary principle of all things.”
      4) Does it have any relation to the electric fluid, whose effects
we are familiar with?
      “It is its element.”
      5) How is the universal fluid displayed to us in its simplest form?
      “To find it in its absolute simplest form, one would have to
ascend toward the pure spirits. In your world, however, it is always
modified to varying degrees in order to form the dense matter all
around you. Nevertheless, you could say that it is closest to its
simplest form in the fluid known as the magnetic animalized fluid.”

         6) It has been stated that the universal fluid is the source of all
life. Is it at the same time the source of all intelligence?
         “No. This particular fluid merely animates matter.”
         7) Since it is this fluid that forms the perispirit, it seems that
it undergoes a kind of condensation, which, to a certain point,
approaches matter per se.
         “As you say, ‘to a certain point’, because it does not possess
all the properties of matter per se, and its condensation is greater
or lesser, according to the nature of the various worlds.”
         8) How does a spirit move a solid object?
         “It combines a portion of the universal fluid with the fluid
emitted by the medium in order to move it.”
         9) Do spirits lift tables using their arms, which have become
solidified somehow?
         “The answer to that question will not yet tell you what you
want to know. When a table moves underneath your hands, it
is because the spirit who has been evoked has taken enough of
the universal fluid to infuse the table with artificial life. Having
prepared the table in this way, the spirit attracts it and moves it
under the influence of its own fluid, which it emits by exerting its
own will. When the object that it wants to move is too heavy for it, it
asks for the help of other spirits who possess similar characteristics.
Because of its ethereal nature, the spirit in and of itself cannot
act upon dense matter without some kind of intermediary; that
is, without the link that connects it to matter. This link is what
you call the perispirit and it provides the key to all physical spirit
phenomena. I believe I have explained the matter clearly enough
to have made myself understood.”
         We would call attention to the sentence: “The answer to
that question will not YET tell you what you want to know.” This
Spirit understood perfectly well that all the preceding questions
had the sole purpose of leading up to Question 9. He was referring


                                    105

                                            Chapter IV


to our thought, wherein we had in fact anticipated a different
response; i.e., one that would confirm our own idea about the way
spirits move tables.
       10) Are the spirits whom it calls upon to help of a less evolved
nature? Are they under its orders?
       “They are almost always its equals and come spontaneously.”
       11) Are all spirits able to produce phenomena of this kind?
       “The spirits who produce them are always of a less evolved
nature that is not yet entirely free of material influences.”
       12) We can understand that highly evolved spirits do not concern
themselves with matters that are well below them, but we would like
to know if they would have the ability to do so if they wanted to since
they are more dematerialized.
       “They possess mental power, as the others possess physical
power. When they have need of the latter, they employ those who
have it. Haven’t we already stated that they use lower order spirits
in the same way that you employ porters?”
       We have already stated that the density of the perispirit,
if one may say so, varies according to the nature of the various
worlds.16 It also seems to vary on the same world according to
different individuals. In morally advanced spirits, it is subtler and
comes close to the perispirit of high order entities. On the other
hand, in low order spirits it is closer to matter, and this is what
causes the persistence of the illusions of earthly life in such spirits,
who think and act as if they were still physically alive, possessing
the same desires and, we could almost say, the same sensuality.
This density of the perispirit, which lends it a greater affinity to
matter, is what enables low order spirits to be more skillful at
physical manifestations. It is similar to why a refined person with a
fragile and delicate body, and who is used to intellectual endeavors,
cannot lift heavy loads like a porter can. The matter of his or her

                                                    106

                Explanation of the Physical Manifestations


body is somewhat less compact, the organs are less resilient and the
neural fluid is less intense. The perispirit is for the spirit what the
body is for the individual. Its density results from the less purified
nature of the spirit; hence, this density replaces muscular strength;
i.e., it gives it greater power over the fluids needed for this type of
manifestation than a spirit of a more ethereal nature possesses. If
a more evolved spirit wants to produce such effects, it does what
frail persons among us would do: it employs a spirit of the trade.
         13) If we correctly understand what you have said, the vital
principle lies in the universal fluid. The spirit draws the semi-material
envelope that comprises its perispirit from this fluid, and it is through
this fluid that it acts upon inert matter. Is this so?
         “Yes, it means that it animates matter with a sort of artificial
life: matter becomes infused with animal life. The table that
moves under your hands is alive with animal-like life and obeys
the intelligent being itself. The spirit itself does not push the table
as if it were some kind of physical load, and when the table rises
into the air, the spirit is not lifting it with its arms; instead, the
animated table obeys the impulse given to it by the spirit.”
         14) What role does the medium play in this phenomenon?
         “I have already said that the medium’s own fluid is
combined with the universal fluid accumulated by the spirit. The
uniting of both the animalized and universal fluids is required in
order to endow the table with life. However, you must not forget
that this life is only momentary. It stops with the cessation of the
fluids’ action, and often before the process is fully completed –
as soon as the amount of the fluids is no longer sufficient to
animate the table.”
         15) Can a spirit act without resorting to a medium?
         “It can act without the medium being aware of it; in other
words, many persons help spirits to produce certain phenomena
without even suspecting it. These persons are like fountains from


                                   107

                              Chapter IV


which spirits draw the animal fluid they need. Consequently, the
conscious participation of a medium, as you know, is not always
necessary, especially with spontaneous phenomena.”
       16) Does the animated table act with intelligence? Does it think?
       “The object itself does not think; it is like a walking stick
that you might use to make an intelligent signal to someone:
the vitality that animates it enables it to obey the impulse of the
intelligence behind it. You should realize that the moving table
does not become a spirit, and it has neither thought nor will.”
       We frequently use a similar expression in every day language:
concerning a wheel that is spinning rapidly, we say that it is
animated by a rapid movement.
       17) What is the preponderant cause in the production of this
phenomenon: the spirit itself or the fluid?
       “The spirit is the cause and the fluid is its instrument. Both
are required.”
       18) In this case, what role does the medium’s will play?
       “To call upon the spirits and to aid them in giving impulse
to the fluid.
       – Is the medium’s will always indispensable?
       “It increases the potency, but it is not always necessary, since
a movement may occur in spite of or contrary to the medium’s
will – further proof for the existence of an independent cause.”
       It is not always even necessary for the hands to come in
contact with the object in order for it to move. Almost always,
all that they are needed for is to provide the initial impulse, but
after the object has been animated it can obey the will without
any physical contact. Of course, this depends on the power of
the medium or the nature of the spirits involved. Moreover, even
the first contact is not always needed. We have proof of this in
the spontaneous movements and dislocations that no one even
thought about causing.


                                  108

                Explanation of the Physical Manifestations


       19) Why can’t everyone produce the same effects, and why don’t
all mediums possess the same power?
       “It depends on physical composition and the greater or lesser
ease in combining the fluids. It further depends on the greater
or lesser affinity between the medium and the spirits, who find
in the medium the required fluidic potency. As is the case with
magnetizers, this potency is either little or great. In this regard,
we have found individuals who are completely resistant to the
process; others in which the combining of the fluids only occurs
because they exert their own will; finally, others in which it occurs
so naturally and easily that they are not even aware of it, where
they serve as unknowing instruments, as we have just stated.” (See
below, the chapter concerning spontaneous manifestations)
       There is no doubt that magnetism is the principle behind
these phenomena, but not as is generally supposed. We have proof
of this in the existence of powerful magnetizers who cannot even
move a small table, while there are individuals – even children –
who do not know how to magnetize at all and who merely have to
place their fingers upon a heavy table in order for it to shake. Thus,
if mediumistic power does not depend on magnetic power, it must
have some other cause.
       20) Can those called electricals be regarded as mediums?
       “Such individuals draw from within themselves the fluid
required for producing the phenomena and they can act without
the aid of spirits. They are not mediums per se in the precise
meaning of the word. It might happen that a spirit will assist them
and take advantage of their natural abilities, however.”
       Such individuals are like somnambulists, who can act with
or without spirits helping them. (See chap. XIV below, Mediums,
in the section dealing with somnambulists)
       21) When they act upon solid objects, do spirits penetrate their
substance or do they remain outside it?


                                   109

                                Chapter IV


        “They do both. We have already stated that matter is no
obstacle to spirits, who can penetrate anything. A portion of their
perispirit identifies itself, so to speak, with the object it penetrates.”
        22) How does a spirit produce raps? Does it use a physical object?
        “No. Just as they do not use their arms to lift a table, you
must realize that they do not have hammers at their disposal to
produce raps. Instead, their ‘hammer’ is the combined fluid that
they put into action using their will to move objects or produce
raps. When they move objects, light transmits the movement to
your sight; when they produce raps, air transmits the sound to you.”
        23) We can understand this when dealing with a hard object,
but how can a spirit make us hear noises or articulated sounds within
the air alone?
        “Since it can act upon matter, it can thus act upon air in the
same way that it acts upon a table. As for articulating sounds, it
can imitate them just like all other noises.”
        24) You have stated that a spirit does not use its hands to move
a table, but during certain visual manifestations hands have appeared
that played keyboards, actually moving the keys and producing sounds.
In this case, isn’t the movement of the keys produced by the pressure of
their fingers? And isn’t the pressure of their fingers direct and real when
we feel them touch us and when they even leave marks on the skin?
        “You cannot comprehend the nature of spirits and the way
they act by merely using comparisons, which provide only an
incomplete idea of the matter. It is always a mistake to compare their
manner of acting to yours. Spirits must always act in accordance
with their organization. Haven’t we stated that the perispirit’s fluid
penetrates matter and identifies with it, endowing it with artificial
life? Well then, when a spirit plays a keyboard with its fingers, it is
really doing so; however, it does not use muscular force to press the
keys. Instead, like the table, it animates the keyboard, which obeys
its will and vibrates the strings. In cases such as this, something else


                                   110

                Explanation of the Physical Manifestations


happens that is hard for you to comprehend. Certain spirits are
still so little-evolved and so material in comparison with evolved
spirits that they retain the illusions of earthly life and think that
they continue to act as they did when they were in the body. They
do not perceive the true cause of the effects they produce, as a
commoner does not understand the theory behind the sounds he
or she pronounces. If you ask such spirits how they can play the
piano, they will say that they use their fingers since that is what they
believe. They produce the effect instinctively without even knowing
how; nonetheless, they actually produce it by their will. Whenever
they speak or make themselves heard, it is the same thing.”
        Thus, we can understand that spirits can produce all the
effects we ourselves can, but by means in keeping with their
organization. They possess certain inner forces that replace our
muscles, just as persons who cannot speak sign with their hands.
        25) Among the phenomena cited as proofs for the action of a
concealed power, there are those who are obviously contrary to all the
known laws of nature. Hence, isn’t it correct to question them?
        “It just so happens that humans are far from knowing about
all the laws of nature; if they knew about them, it would imply
that they were highly evolved spirits. However, every day there are
incidents to disprove those who think they know everything, who
intend to impose limits on nature, and yet they are no less proud of
themselves at the fact. By constantly unveiling new mysteries, God
warns people that they must distrust their own knowledge, because
a day will come in which the knowledge of the most learned person
will be confounded. Every day, don’t you see examples of objects
that are impelled by a motion that is capable of overcoming the
power of gravity? Doesn’t a ball thrown into the air momentarily
overcome this force? Poor humans, who regard yourselves as being
so learned, and whose foolish vanity is confused at every turn, you
must realize that you are still so very small!”


                                   111

                               Chapter IV


        75. The above explanations are clear, categorical and
unambiguous. From them we may emphasize the crucial point that
the universal fluid, which harbors the principle of life, is the chief
agent in manifestations, and that this agent receives its impulse
from the spirit, whether incarnate or discarnate. This condensed
fluid comprises the perispirit or semi-material envelope of the
spirit. When incarnate, the perispirit is connected to the matter of
the body; in the errant state, it is free. While the spirit is incarnate,
the substance of its perispirit is more or less bound, more or less
adherent to it, if we may put it so. In certain individuals there is a
kind of emanation of this fluid as a result of particular conditions
in their physical composition, which is, properly speaking, what
produces physical effects mediums. The greater or lesser abundance
of the emanation of this animalized fluid and the ease with which it
is combined determines the medium’s power. This emanation is not
permanent, however, which explains the intermittency of the ability.
       76. Let us make a comparison. When we want to strike
something that is some distance away, we first determine to do so
with our thought, but thought alone cannot actualize our intent.
We need an intermediary, which our thought will direct: a stick, a
projectile, a blast of air, etc. Note further that our thought cannot
act directly upon the stick, for if we do not touch it, it will not
act by itself. Our thought, which is the spirit itself incarnated in
our body, is united to the body by the perispirit and cannot act
upon the body without it, in the same way that it cannot act upon
the stick without the help of the body. Therefore, the spirit acts
upon the perispirit, which is the substance with which it has the
most affinity. Then, the perispirit acts upon the muscles, which
in turn enable the hand to pick up the stick and the stick to
strike the target. When the spirit is not incarnate, it requires an
instrument – the fluid that aids it in making the object carry out
the impulse of its will.

                                  112

                Explanation of the Physical Manifestations


        77. Therefore, when an object is moved, lifted or thrown
through the air, the spirit does not take hold of it, lift it or throw
it as we do with our hands. It saturates it, so to speak, with its
fluid, combined with the medium’s fluid. Momentarily animated
thereby, the object acts like a living being, with the difference that
it does not have a will of its own but instead obeys the impulse of
the spirit’s will.
        Thus, the vital fluid, impelled by the spirit, endows inert
objects with artificial and momentary life. Since the perispirit is
nothing other than this vital fluid itself, it follows that the incarnate
spirit, by means of its perispirit, is what gives life to its own body,
and it stays united to it as long as its organization enables it to.
When the spirit withdraws, the body dies. So, if instead of a table
we took a wooden statue and acted upon it like we did upon the
table, we would have a statue that could move about and produce
raps in response to our questions; in other words, we would have a
statue that was momentarily animated with artificial life – besides
talking tables, we would also have talking statues. How much light
this explanation casts over an infinite number of phenomena
heretofore inexplicable! How many allegories and mysterious
effects it resolves!
       78. In spite of all the evidence, disbelievers object that the
phenomenon of the levitation of tables without a means of support
is impossible because it is contrary to the law of gravity. First, we
will respond that denial in and of itself is not proof; second, if the
phenomenon is real, it is somehow contrary to all known laws,
which would prove one thing: the phenomenon originates from an
unknown law, and those who deny the fact cannot claim to know
about all the laws of nature. We have just explained this unknown
law; nevertheless, disbelievers will not regard our explanation as
sufficient since is was provided by spirits who have shed their earthly
garments instead of “spirits” who still wear theirs and occupy a seat

                                   113

                                Chapter IV


at the Academy. Hence, if the spirit of Arago had revealed this
law while he was still alive, they would all have accepted it with
eyes shut tight, but if given by the exact same spirit after death, it
would be pure nonsense. Why so? Because they believe that since
Arago is dead, then everything he believed is dead forever. We have
no intention of dissuading them; nevertheless, since this objection
might trouble certain persons, we will try to respond to them from
their very own point of view; that is, we will momentarily set aside
the artificial life explanation.
        79. When one creates a vacuum in a bell-glass by using a
vacuum pump, the bell-glass sticks to the base and it is impossible
to unstick the glass because of the air pressure holding it down. If
air is put back into it, the bell-glass is easy to unstick because the
air pressure has been restored to equilibrium, and if it is left to
itself it will remain on the plate due to the law of gravity. However,
if the air pressure inside the bell-glass becomes greater than the
air on the outside, the glass will rise in spite of gravity. If a rapid
and forceful current of air is employed, the glass will remain
suspended in the air without any visible means of support, like
what happens with those dolls that spin upon the sprays of a water
fountain. So, why wouldn’t the universal fluid – the basic element
of all matter – accumulated around a table not have the ability
to increase or decrease the table’s specific relative weight, just like
the air does with the bell-glass, or hydrogen does with balloons,
without derogating from the law of gravity? Do you know about
all the properties and the full power of this fluid? No. Well then,
do not deny a fact simply because you cannot explain it.
       80. Let us return to the explanation of how a table moves.
If a spirit can lift a table by the means indicated, then it can lift
anything else as well: an armchair, for example. And if it can lift an
armchair, it can also lift it with a person sitting in it if it uses enough


                                   114

                       Explanation of the Physical Manifestations


force. Thus, we have provided an explanation for the phenomenon
that has been produced a hundred times by Mr. Home17 himself
and by others too. He repeated it on a recent trip to London, and
in order to prove to his audience that they were not victims of an
optical illusion, he made a mark on the ceiling with a pencil and
also allowed them to pass beneath the chair. Everyone knows that
Mr. Home is a powerful physical effects medium. In this instance,
he was both the efficient cause and the levitated object itself.

                   Increase and Decrease in the
                        Weight of Objects
       81. We alluded earlier to the possible increasing of an object’s
weight, which is a phenomenon that has in fact been produced at
times, and about which there is nothing any more abnormal than
the resistance of the bell-glass caused by atmospheric pressure.
Under the influence of certain mediums, we have seen very light
objects offer the same sort of resistance, and then suddenly yield
to very little effort. With the bell-glass experiment, the object in
reality weighs no more or less than it normally does; it just seems
heavier because of the outside cause acting upon it. The same
thing probably happens with a table. It continues to maintain
its intrinsic weight since its mass has not been increased, but an
outside force opposes its movement. The cause may be in the
surrounding fluids that penetrate it, just as the bell-glass cause is
in the atmospheric pressure. Perform the bell-glass experiment in
front of an unlearned peasant, and he will not understand that the
acting agent is actually the air that he cannot see; it would be very
easy to persuade him that it was the Devil’s work.

     Daniel Dunglas Home was a famous British medium who produced levitation phenomena – Tr.



                                             115

                             Chapter IV


        One could perhaps think that since the fluid is imponderable,
then its accumulation could not increase an object’s weight. Agreed.
However, notice that if we have employed the word accumulation,
it is to make a comparison and not to identify the fluid with the
air. Yes, it may be imponderable; nevertheless, there is nothing to
prove that it is. Its essential nature is unknown to us and we are far
from knowing about all of its properties. Before knowing about
the weight of air, no one would have suspected such an effect to
be possible. Electricity is also classified among the imponderable
fluids; nevertheless, an object can be held down by an electric
current and will strongly resist whoever attempts to lift it. It thus
appears to have become heavier, but simply because of the fact that
there is no support to be seen, it would be illogical to conclude
that there is none. Hence, a spirit may possess means of leverage
unknown to us. Nature proves to us every day that it cannot be
limited to the testimony of our senses.
        One remarkable phenomenon, of which we have many
similar examples, could only be explained by a similar cause. It
involves a young and delicate lady, who by using only two fingers
and as easily as she would a feather, can lift a strong and healthy
man along with the chair upon which he is sitting. The intermittent
expression of the faculty in this type of phenomenon proves that
its cause is foreign to the person who possesses it.

         Noises, Racket and Disturbances
        82. The phenomena we have just dealt with are usually
artificially produced; however, they sometimes occur spontaneously,
without the participants’ will, and, in fact, they almost always
become quite untimely. Furthermore, what excludes them from
the notion that they are the effects of an imagination that has
become over-excited by Spiritist ideas is that they occur among
persons who have never even heard of Spiritism and at times when
they are least expected. These phenomena, which may be regarded
as involving natural Spiritist practice, are very important because
they exclude any suspicion of contrivance. This is why we have
recommended to individuals who concern themselves with spirit
phenomena that they gather all the data of this type which they

                               117

                                Chapter V


may become aware of, but especially that they carefully determine
their reality through a detailed study of the circumstances so that
they may assure themselves that they are not the objects of a simple
illusion or hoax.
       83. Of all the spirit manifestations, the simplest and most
frequent are noises and raps. However, it is especially in these cases
that we must be on guard against illusion since there are many natural
causes that can produce them: the wind whistling or banging an
object, our own moving of an object without our awareness of it,
an acoustic effect, a hidden animal, an insect, etc. – even off-colored
pranks. Besides, spirit noises have peculiar characteristics, with
variable intensity and tone, and which makes them easy to recognize
and not to be confused with creaking wood, crackling fire or the
dull tick-tock of a clock. The raps are dry, sometimes muffled, weak
and light; sometimes, loud and distinct, even noisy, and they change
places and repeat themselves without any mechanical regularity. The
most effective means of controlling them, which leaves no doubt
as to their origin, is to subject them to our will. If the noises make
themselves heard wherever we so indicate, if they respond to our
thought by repeating themselves the number of times we request, and
if they increase or decrease their intensity, we cannot deny that there is
an intelligent cause present. Nevertheless, the lack of such a response
does not necessarily prove the contrary.
       84. However, if after a detailed examination we accept the
fact that the noises or any other effect are real manifestations,
would it then be reasonable for us to be afraid of them? Assuredly
not, since these cases pose no danger. Only persons who believe
that the Devil is involved can be affected adversely by them,
like children who fear werewolves and bogeymen. Under certain
circumstances, we must agree, these manifestations take on very
disagreeable proportions and persistence; therefore, those who


                                   118

                  Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


experience them naturally desire to get rid of them. Consequently,
an explanation regarding the matter is required.
       85. We have already stated that physical manifestations are
meant to call our attention to something and to convince us that
there is a supra-human power present. We have also stated that
highly evolved spirits do not concern themselves directly with these
manifestations and that they use less evolved spirits to produce
them; just as we use servants for heavier tasks, highly evolved spirits
do so for the purpose we have just indicated. After such purpose has
been achieved and since it is no longer needed, the manifestation
ceases. One or two examples will make the matter more intelligible.
       86. Several years ago, when I first began my study of
Spiritism, I was involved with the subject one evening when I
heard raps that sounded all around me for four consecutive hours.
It was the first time that this had happened. I verified that there
was no incidental cause involved, but at the moment I was not
able to learn any more about it. At the time, I frequently met with
an excellent writing medium, so the next day I questioned the
spirit who normally communicated through him as to what had
caused the raps. The spirit answered me: “It was your familiar spirit
wanting to speak with you.” “And what did he want to say to me?”
“You can ask him yourself because he is right here.” So I asked him
and he identified himself using an allegorical name (other spirits
told me afterwards that he belonged to a very high order and that
he had performed a very important role on the earth). He pointed
out errors in my work, indicating the exact lines where I could find
them. He gave me useful and wise advice and added that he would
always be with me and would answer me whenever I wanted to
question him. Since then, this spirit has, in fact, never left me. He
has given me numerous highly valuable proofs, and his benevolent
and effective intervention has helped me both with the every day


                                 119

                              Chapter V


problems of physical life and with metaphysical ones. However,
ever since that first conversation, the raps have ceased. What did he
in fact want? He wanted to establish regular communication with
me, but to do so he had to alert me to his presence. Having done so,
he explained his motives and we established a regular relationship –
the raps were no longer necessary. It is no longer necessary to beat a
drum to awaken soldiers when they have already arisen.
       A very similar case involved one of our friends. For quite
some time, he had heard various noises around his room, and
which became very annoying. Having an opportunity to interview
his father’s spirit via a writing medium, he learned what it was
that those spirits wanted. He fulfilled their request and from then
on no longer heard the noises. We would point out that persons
who have regular and easy means of communicating with spirits
are much less subject to manifestations of this kind, which is
understandable.
       87. Spontaneous manifestations are not always limited to
noises and raps. They sometimes degenerate into veritable racket
and disturbances. Furniture and other objects are flipped over;
various projectiles are hurled about outside the room; doors and
windows are opened and closed by invisible hands and windowpanes
are broken – none of this can be attributed to illusion.
       This disorder is quite often very real, though at times it is
only apparent. A racket may be heard in an adjoining room – the
crash of dinnerware as it apparently hits the floor, or logs of wood
rolling around. Then, when one runs to investigate, everything is
found to be peaceful and in order; however, leave the room and
the tumult starts all over again.
      88. Such manifestations are neither rare nor new, and there
are few local chronicles that do not contain some account of this
type. There is no doubt that fear has often exaggerated the facts,


                                 120

                  Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


which have assumed gigantically ridiculous proportions when
passed from one person to the next. With the help of superstition,
the houses in which such phenomena occur have been considered
as being haunted by the Devil; hence all the fantastic and
horrifying fables of ghosts. Deception, on the other hand, has
not lost the opportunity to exploit such credulity to its own
profit. Even when they are reduced to reality, one may certainly
understand the impression that incidents of this kind can have
on weak characters who have been predisposed to superstitious
notions by education. The safest way to avoid the troubles that can
arise from these incidents (because they cannot be prevented) is to
make the truth known. The simplest incidents become frightening
when the causes behind them are unknown. When there is finally
widespread familiarity with spirits, and when those with whom
they communicate no longer believe they are dealing with a legion
of demons, fear will disappear completely.
       In Revue Spirite, many authentic occurrences of this kind
have been recorded, among which are the story of the rapping
spirit of Bergzabern, whose nasty influence lasted eight years (May,
June and July issues of 1858); that of the spirit of Dibbelsdorf
(Aug. 1858); that of the baker of Grandes-Ventes, close to Dieppe
(Mar. 1860); the one on Noyers Street in Paris (Aug., 1860);
the spirit of Castelnaudary, entitled l’Histoire d’un Damné (Feb.
1860); the one of the manufacturer of St. Petersburg (Apr. 1860),
and many others.
      89. Manifestations of this nature often assume the character
of bona fide persecution. We know of six sisters who lived together
and who for several years awoke in the morning to find their
clothing scattered everywhere, hidden in the ceiling or ripped and
cut to pieces in spite of their precautions in keeping them locked
up. Often, persons have been lying down, but perfectly awake, and
have seen the curtains thrown open, or their covers and pillows

                                 121

                             Chapter V


violently snatched away, or they have been lifted into the air and
sometimes even thrown out of bed. These events are more frequent
than one might think, but most victims keep quiet out of fear of
being ridiculed. We know that due to these facts some of these
persons have been subjected to medical treatment for deranged
individuals as though they were experiencing hallucinations, and
as a result they ended up actually losing their minds. Medicine
cannot comprehend such incidents, since it will only accept
material causes, a fact which has led to disastrous errors. History
will someday comment on certain treatments of the 19th century
in the same way it comments nowadays on certain procedures of
medieval times.
       We perfectly accept the fact that some of these instances
are the work of malice or malevolence, but since it has been
sufficiently verified that they are not produced by any human, we
must conclude that they are, according to some, the work of the
Devil, or according to others, the work of spirits. But what spirits?
       90. Highly evolved spirits, like serious and responsible
human individuals, do not enjoy themselves by causing an
uproar. We have often interviewed the spirits involved in this type
of phenomenon about their reason for troubling someone’s rest
and have found that most of them have only wanted to entertain
themselves. They are frivolous spirits rather than evil, who laugh
about the alarm they cause and the futile research their victims
undertake in trying to find out the cause of the commotion.
They will often attach themselves to individuals and entertain
themselves by troubling them everywhere they go. At other times,
they attach themselves to a particular place out of pure caprice, but
they sometimes do so out of vengeance, as we will see. In certain
cases, however, their intentions are more praiseworthy; they want
to call attention to themselves and to establish communications,
whether to give useful advice to the person whom they are

                                122

                  Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


addressing or to make a request for themselves. We have often
seen them ask for prayers or the fulfillment of some obligation
they were unable to accomplish; others, for their own peace of
mind, want to mend a wrong they had committed while alive. It
is usually a mistake to fear their presence, which may be untimely
but not dangerous.
      The desire to be free of them is understandable, but the
way used to do so is usually the opposite of what should be
done. When dealing with spirits who are merely entertaining
themselves, the more seriously they are taken, the more persistent
they become – like ornery children, who bother people even more
the more impatient they become, and who frighten the timid.
On the other hand, if people were simply to laugh at their antics,
they would tire of them and leave their victims in peace. We
know someone who, instead of being annoyed by them, urged
them on, challenging them to do this or that, so that after a few
days they went away. But as we have said, there are some who act
with less frivolous reasons. Therefore, it is always best to try to
find out what they want. If they ask for something, their visits
are sure to cease when they have been satisfied. The best way
for obtaining information is to evoke them through a capable
writing medium. From their responses, one can determine who
they are and may act accordingly. If an unhappy spirit is involved,
charity requires treating it with the attention it deserves; if it is a
deceptive spirit, we may deal with it directly; if it is evil, we must
pray to God to enable it to become better. In all cases, however,
prayer can only bring good results. On the other hand, solemn
exorcism formulas only provoke them to laughter – they are of
no consequence to them. If one can communicate with them,
one should distrust the burlesque or scary titles they sometimes
give themselves in order to entertain themselves at the gullibility
of their audience.


                                 123

                             Chapter V


      We shall return to deal with this subject in more detail, as
well as the causes that frequently render prayers useless, in the
chapters Haunted Places (IX) and Obsession (XXIII).
       91. Although they are produced by less evolved spirits,
these phenomena are quite often caused by spirits of a higher
order for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of
incorporeal beings and a power superior to that of humans. The
repercussions that result from them, the very horror they can
stir up, call attention to the matter and end up opening the eyes
of the most incredulous, who would otherwise think it simpler
to regard the phenomena as effects of the imagination, a very
convenient explanation that dispenses with searching for others.
But when objects are turned over or thrown at people’s heads,
it would take a very complacent imagination not to see that
the incidents are real. If something occurs, it obviously has a
cause, and if a cool and collected observation shows the effect to
be independent of any human will or material cause, and that
it furthermore shows obvious signs of its own intelligence and
free will – its most characteristic trait – people will be forced
to attribute it to a concealed intelligence. But who are these
mysterious beings? That is what Spiritist studies have revealed in
a way that is hard to dispute, thanks to the means such studies
have provided for communicating with them.
       Moreover, Spiritist studies have also taught us how to
determine what is real, false or exaggerated about the phenomena
we have not witnessed. When a strange effect occurs – a noise, a
movement or even an apparition – the first thought that should
enter our minds is that its cause is completely natural, because that
is the most probable one. We must thus search for its cause with
great care and not accept the intervention of spirits unless we do
so judiciously. This will enable us to avoid illusion. For example,
someone who receives a slap or blow from a cane to the back

                                124

                 Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


without being approached by anyone (as has happened), could
not doubt the presence of an invisible being.
       We must caution ourselves against reports that can be
considered to be more or less exaggerated, and also against our
own impressions so that we do not attribute an unseen origin to
everything we find unexplainable. There are many simple and
natural causes that can produce effects that appear quite strange
at first glance, and it would obviously be superstitious to see
spirits everywhere, occupied with overturning furniture, breaking
windows and causing all sorts of domestic disturbances that may
more reasonably be attributed to our own carelessness.

               The Hurling of Objects
       92. The explanation of how inert objects are moved
naturally applies to all the spontaneous effects we have just dealt
with. Although they are louder than raps within a table, noises
have the same cause. The hurling and displacement of objects
are produced by the same force that lifts any object into the air.
There is even a circumstance that serves to support this theory. We
might ask where the medium may be found in these cases, and the
Spirits have explained that there is always someone whose forces
are used unwittingly. Spontaneous manifestations rarely occur in
isolated areas, but almost always occur in inhabited houses and
are due to the presence of certain individuals who unknowingly
exert their influence. These people are mediums but are unaware
of their abilities; we thus call them natural mediums. They are
to other mediums what natural somnambulists are to magnetic
somnambulists and are as worthy of examination.
      93. The voluntary or involuntary intervention of an
individual endowed with a special aptitude appears to be necessary


                                125

                               Chapter V


in most cases to produce these phenomena, although sometimes
there are circumstances where a spirit seems to be acting alone.
However, even in such cases it could still be taking the animalized
fluid from someone who is not in the immediate area. This would
explain why it is that even though spirits are constantly around us,
they do not cause disturbances all the time. A spirit must first want
to, and must have a purpose and a motive, without which it does
not do anything. Then, it must find an individual nearby who is
capable of aiding it where it intends to act – a coincidence that
rarely happens. If such an individual unexpectedly appears, the
spirit takes advantage of the opportunity. However, despite these
favorable circumstances, it may still be prevented by a superior will,
who will not allow it to act as it wants, or it may be allowed only
to act within certain limits in cases where such manifestations may
be considered useful, whether to serve as a means of conviction or
as a trial for the person subjected to them.
       94. Regarding the above matter, we will allude to a
conversation arising from events that occurred in June of 1860
on Noyers Street in Paris. Details of the incident can be found in
Revue Spirite, August 1860:
       1) (To St. Louis) Would you be so kind as to tell us if the events
that are said to be occurring on Noyers Street are real or not? We have
no doubt that it is quite possible for them to occur.
       “Yes, the events are real, but popular imagination has
exaggerated the facts, whether out of fear or mockery. Nonetheless,
I will repeat that they are real. The manifestations are being
caused by a spirit who is entertaining itself at the expense of the
inhabitants of the place.”
       2) Is there someone in the house who is the cause of the
manifestations?
       “Such manifestations are always caused by the presence
of a disliked individual to whom the spirit attaches itself. The

                                  126

                    Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


troublesome spirit is displeased with the inhabitant of the place
and wants to make mischief or even make him move out.”
        3) We would ask if there is someone amongst the inhabitants
who is the cause of the phenomena due to spontaneous and involuntary
mediumship.
        “That is always necessary, because if such is not the case,
these incidents cannot happen. A spirit lives in a place of its own
choosing. As long as there is no one there whom it can use, it
remains inactive, but when such a person appears, it entertains
itself as much as it can.
        4) Is the presence of this person in the place itself indispensable?
        “Normally yes, and that is the case in this particular
situation. That is why I said that these incidents could not be
happening otherwise. But I do not mean to generalize. There
are in fact cases where the medium’s presence in the place itself
is not necessary.”
        5) Since such spirits are of a lower order, is the aptitude for
serving as their auxiliary an unfavorable assumption about the
individual? Does it indicate an affinity for beings of this nature?
        “Not exactly, because this aptitude results from a physical
disposition. Nevertheless, it almost always indicates a materialistic
tendency that would preferably not exist, because the more morally
evolved a person is, the more he or she attracts good spirits, who
necessarily repel the evil ones.”
        6) Where does the spirit go in search of the objects it utilizes?
        “It almost always finds these objects in the place itself or
in the vicinity. A force that proceeds from the spirit flings them
through the air and causes them to fall wherever it wishes.”
        7) Since spontaneous manifestations are often allowed and even
caused for the purpose of convincing disbelievers, it seems to us that if
some of these individuals were themselves their target, they would be
forced to yield to the evidence. People often complain of not having


                                    127

                              Chapter V


witnessed conclusive facts. Wouldn’t it depend on spirits to provide
them with appreciable proof?
       “Don’t atheists and materialists witness at every moment
the effects of the power of God and of thought? But this does
not prevent them from denying both God and the soul. Did
the miracles of Jesus convert all his contemporaries? Didn’t the
Pharisees, who said to him, “Master, show us a sign”, resemble
those who today ask you to show them manifestations? If they
fail to be convinced by the marvels of creation, they will be no
more affected by the appearance of spirits, even if they appear in
the most obvious manner, because these individuals’ pride has
transformed them into stubborn mules. They would have plenty
of opportunities to witness them if they sought such opportunities
in good faith. That is why God does not deem it appropriate to
do more for them than what God has already done for those who
sincerely seek to educate themselves, because God only rewards
persons of good will. Their disbelief will not impede the fulfillment
of the divine will. You have already seen that it has not hindered
the expansion of the Doctrine. So do not concern yourselves with
their opposition, which is to the Doctrine what a shadow is to
a painting: it lends it greater relief. What would be their merit
if they had to be convinced by force? God leaves to them the
responsibility for their own stubbornness and this responsibility
is heavier than you might think. Fortunate are those who believe
without having seen, said Jesus, because they do not doubt the
power of God.”
       8) Do you think it would be appropriate to evoke that spirit in
order to ask it for a few explanations?
       “Evoke it if you want to, but it is of a low order and its
answers will be quite insignificant.”
      95. Conversation with the troublesome Noyers Street spirit:
      1) [Evocation]

                                 128

                   Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


       “Why did you call me? Do you want me to throw some
stones at you? Then, we would see you skedaddle for your lives in
spite of your brave airs!”
       2) Throw all the stones you want; we still wouldn’t be frightened.
In fact, we would like to see if you can actually throw some.
       “Well, perhaps I couldn’t right here. You have a guardian
that watches so well over you.”
       3) Is there someone on Noyers Street who has helped you with
the evil tricks you are playing on the inhabitants of the house?
       “Of course. I found a really good instrument, and there was
no learned, wise and prudent spirit to stop me, because I am merry
and sometimes I like to amuse myself.”
       4) Who has served as your instrument?
       “A maid.”
       5) She has helped you without knowing it?
       “Oh yeah! Poor girl! She got scared the most.”
       6) Do you have some hostile purpose?
       “Me? I don’t have anything against anyone. But folks who
feel they always have to meddle in everything will turn the matter
to their own advantage.”
       7) What do you mean by that? We don’t understand you.
       “I’m just trying to have fun, but you will study the incident
and you’ll have one more fact to prove that we exist.”
       8) You say you don’t have any hostile purpose, but you have
broken all the windowpanes in the place and have caused real damage.
       “That’s just a minor detail.”
       9) Where did you find the objects you threw around?
       “They were all over the place. I found them in the courtyard
and in the neighbors’ gardens.”
       10) Did you find all of them or did you make some of them?
(See Chap. VIII)
       “I didn’t create anything or compose anything.”


                                  129

                                 Chapter V


        11) If you hadn’t found them, could you have made them?
        “That would have been tricky. But we can mix materials and
make something.”
        12) Now tell us how you threw them.
        “Oh, that’s hard for me to say! I looked for help in the
electrical composition of that girl and mixed it with mine, which
is less material. So together we could carry those objects.”
        13) I think you’ll agree to give us some information about
yourself. First, tell us if you died a long time ago.
        “A long time ago – at least fifty years.”
        14) What was your job?
        “Nothing special. I was a ragpicker in this neighborhood
and sometimes I got insulted because I really liked good ole Noah’s
red liquor. That’s why I wanted them to clear out.”
        15) Have you yourself and of your own free will answered our
questions?
        “I had an instructor.”
        16) And who is this instructor?
        “Your very kind King Louis.”
      We asked this question because of the nature of some of the responses,
      which appeared to be beyond the capability of the spirit itself both in
      the substance of the ideas expressed and in the form of the language. It
      is nothing extraordinary that he had been aided by a more enlightened
      spirit who wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to instruct us.
      This is a common occurrence, but a notable particularity in this case is
      that the other spirit’s influence was made apparent in the handwriting
      itself. In the answers in which he [St. Louis] interfered, the handwriting
      was more regular and flowing, while in the answers of the ragpicker it
      was angular, rough, irregular and often barely legible, revealing a very
      different character.

      17) What do you do nowadays? Do you care about your future?


                                     130

                  Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


      “Not yet. I just wander about. I am remembered so little on
the earth that no one prays for me. Since I don’t have anyone to
help me, I don’t do anything.”
      We will soon see how much may be contributed to the progress and
      relief of less evolved spirits through prayer and counsel.

      18) What was your name when you were alive?
      “Jeannet.”
      19) Very well then, Jeannet, we shall pray for you. Tell us
whether this evocation has pleased or upset you.
      “It has mostly pleased me because you are nice folk, joyful
and lively, although you’re a bit serious. Well, that doesn’t matter.
You listened to me and I’m content.”
                                                             Jeannet

        The Phenomenon of Apportation
      96. This phenomenon only differs from those we dealt
with above because of the benevolent intention of the spirit who
produces it, by the almost always pleasing nature of the objects,
and by the gentle and often delicate manner by which they are
carried. The phenomenon consists in the spontaneous bringing
of objects that were not in the meeting place a few moments
previously. They are usually flowers, but sometimes fruit, candy,
jewelry, etc.
        97. We must point out, however, that this particular
phenomenon is one that most lends itself to being imitated, and
it is therefore necessary to be forewarned against fraud. We know
that the art of stage magic can produce experiences of this type.
However, even if we were not confronted with a professional, we
could easily be fooled by a skillful and self-interested maneuver.
The best of all guarantees is, first, the character, the known honesty

                                 131

                              Chapter V


and the absolute disinterestedness of the individuals who experiment
with these effects; second, a careful examination of all the
circumstances in which the phenomenon occurs; and finally, an
enlightened knowledge of Spiritism, the sole means of determining
if there is anything suspicious about the phenomenon.

     A Spirit’s Dissertation on Apportation
       98. The explanation concerning apportations and physical
manifestations in general has been notably summarized in the
following dissertation by a spirit whose communications bear
the incontestable stamp of depth and logic. Many more of his
explanations will appear over the course of this work. He has made
himself known as Erastus, a disciple of St. Paul, and is the protector
spirit of the medium who serves to interpret him:
       “In order to experience phenomena of this order, it is
indispensable to employ mediums whom I shall call ‘sensitives’,
that is, gifted to the highest degree with the mediumistic faculties
of expansion and penetrability. The easily-excitable nervous system
of these mediums enables them, by means of certain vibrations, to
profusely project their animalized fluid all around them.
       “Impressionable natures, those individuals whose nerves
vibrate at the least emotion, who respond to the lightest sensation
that influences them mentally or physically, internally or
externally, are the most capable of becoming excellent mediums
for the physical effects of tangibility and apportation. In fact,
their nervous system, which is almost entirely deprived of the
refractory envelope, which normally isolates this system in most
incarnates, renders them appropriate for the development of these
phenomena. Thus, a subject of this nature, whose other faculties
are not hostile toward mediumization, will more easily precipitate
the phenomena of tangibility, raps within walls and furniture,
intelligent movings-about, and even the suspension in the air of

                                 132

                           Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


any heavy, inert matter. The same results will be obtained with
greater certainty if instead of just one medium there are several,
equally endowed mediums available.
       “But from the production of such phenomena to the
obtaining of apportations there is a huge gap, for in the latter
case, not only is the job of the spirit more complex and difficult,
but it can only operate using a single mediumistic instrument;
that is, several mediums cannot contribute simultaneously to the
production of the same phenomenon. On the contrary, it may
even be that the presence of certain persons who are antipathetic
to the operating spirit will radically hinder its action. To these
very important reasons we will also add that apportations always
require the greatest concentration, and at the same time, the
greatest diffusion of certain fluids that can only be obtained from
extremely well-gifted mediums; in a word, mediums whose electro-
mediumistic instrument is well conditioned.
       “Normally, apportation phenomena are and will continue
to be exceedingly rare. I do not need to show why they are and
will continue to be less frequent than the other phenomena of
tangibility; from what I have already stated, you yourselves can
infer why. Moreover, these phenomena are of such a nature that
not all mediums can produce them, and not all spirits can induce
them; in fact, between the spirit and the medium a certain affinity,
a certain analogy, in a word, a certain similarity must exist that
enables the expansive part of the perispiritual fluid18 of the medium
to mix, unite and combine with that of the spirit who desires to
perform an apportation. This fusion must occur in such a way
that the resultant force becomes, so to speak, one; that is, in the

18
     We have seen that when trying to express a new idea for which language does not yet
     possess the proper term, the Spirits know perfectly well how to create neologisms. Such
     words as electro-mediumistic, and perispiritual are not ours. Those who criticize us for
     having created the words Spiritist, Spiritism and perispirit, which had no analogous terms,
     can also make the same criticism to the Spirits themselves. – Auth.

same way that an electric current acting upon charcoal produces
a single focus of light. You may ask why this union, this fusion,
is necessary. It is necessary because for the production of these
phenomena, the essential properties of the spirit agent must be
augmented by certain mediumized properties since the vital fluid,
which is indispensable for the production of these mediumistic
phenomena and is the exclusive property of incarnate spirits, must
necessarily impregnate the spirit agent. Only then can the spirit
agent, by means of certain properties of your environment, which
are unknown to you, isolate, render invisible and move certain
material objects and even individuals as well.
        “For now, I am not allowed to reveal to you the particular
laws that govern the gases and fluids that surround you. However,
before many years have passed, before the duration of a normal
incarnate existence has expired, the explanation of such laws and
phenomena will be revealed to you, and you will see the appearance
and development of a new variety of mediums who will fall into a
particular cataleptic state as soon as they are mediumized.
        “You have seen how many difficulties are involved in the
production of apportations. You can logically conclude that
phenomena of this nature are extremely rare, as I have already
stated; so much more reason for spirits not to trouble themselves
with producing them, because it requires on their part an
almost-materialistic effort, which is tedious and wearisome to
them. Besides, it so happens that very frequently, despite the
spirit’s energy and will, the state of the medium sets up an
insurmountable barrier.
        “It is therefore obvious (and I have no doubt that you will
accept the fact) that the perceptible phenomena of raps, movements
and levitation are simple in nature and can be performed by
concentrating and dilating certain fluids, and they can also be
caused and precipitated by the will and effort of capable mediums


                               134

                  Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


if they are seconded by friendly and benevolent spirits. Apportation
phenomena, on the other hand, are multiple, complex in nature
and require the existence of special conditions. In addition, they
can be performed only when just one spirit and one medium are
involved, and besides all the resources needed to produce tangible
phenomena, they require a very special combination to isolate and
render invisible the object or objects to be apported.
        “Every one of you Spiritists has comprehended my
explanations and has realized perfectly well that this concentration
of special fluids is what is needed to produce the mobility and
tactility of inert matter. You have accepted it just as you have
accepted the phenomena of electricity and magnetism, which are
so analogous to mediumistic phenomena, and which are, so to
speak, their confirmation and development. As for disbelievers and
academicians (the latter are even worse than the former) it is not
my duty to convince them, and I am not even concerned about
them. They will someday be convinced by the factual evidence, for
they will have to bow down before the unanimous testimony of
spirit phenomena, just as they have already been forced to do with
respect to other phenomena that they rejected at first.
        “To sum up: while the phenomena of tangibility are frequent,
those of apportation are very rare, since the conditions needed
to produce them are quite difficult to ensure. Consequently, no
medium can say, ‘At such and such time and moment I will obtain
an apportation’, because often the spirit itself finds that it has
been prevented from doing it. I should add that these phenomena
become doubly difficult to produce in public, where there are
almost always energetic refractory elements that paralyze the efforts
of the spirit itself, and even more so the action of the medium.
On the other hand, you are aware that such phenomena are often
produced spontaneously in private meetings, usually without the
medium’s knowledge and premeditation, but rarely occur when


                                 135

                              Chapter V


he or she has been forewarned. This should lead you to conclude
that there is a legitimate reason for being suspicious every time a
medium boasts of being able to obtain them at will or, in other
words, to give orders to spirits as if they were servants, which is
simply absurd. You already know the rule that spirit phenomena
are not to be used to put on shows or to entertain the curious. If a
few spirits are involved in these sorts of things, it can only involve
very simple phenomena and not those which, like apportations
and other similar ones, demand exceptional conditions.
      “Remember, Spiritists, that if it is absurd to systematically
reject all beyond-the-grave phenomena outright, it is also
imprudent to blindly accept everything. When a phenomenon of
tangibility, apparition or apportation occurs spontaneously and
unexpectedly, accept it. But I will never tire of repeating: accept
nothing blindly; every fact must be submitted to a meticulous,
in-depth and critical examination because, believe me, Spiritism,
so rich in sublime and grand phenomena, has nothing to gain
from the insignificant manifestations that skillful stage magicians
can imitate.
      “I know fully well that you will say, ‘But such phenomena
are useful for convincing disbelievers’. You must understand,
however, that if you had no other means for convincing them,
you would not have even a fraction of the Spiritists that you
can count today. Rather, speak to their hearts; that is how most
conversions will occur. If you find it appropriate for certain
individuals, then resort to material phenomena, or at least
present them in such a way that they will not be misinterpreted.
And, especially, observe the normal conditions under which
these phenomena occur, because if they are introduced
inappropriately, they will serve as arguments for disbelievers
instead of means of convincing them.”
                                                               Erastus


                                 136

                     Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


       99. This phenomenon displays a highly remarkable
characteristic: some mediums can only obtain it while in a
somnambulistic state – an easily explainable fact. Somnambulists
display a natural release, a sort of isolation of their spirit and
perispirit, which will facilitate the combining of the required
fluids. Such has been the case of the apportations that we have
witnessed.
       The following questions were asked of the spirit who
produced the phenomenon, but its responses sometimes were
affected by its lack of knowledge. Therefore, we submitted them
to the Spirit Erastus, who was much more enlightened from a
theoretical point of view, and who complemented the answers
with his very judicious comments. One was the artisan; the other
the scholar, and a comparison of these two intelligences is a very
instructive study in itself, for it shows clearly that it is not enough
simply to be a spirit in order to understand everything.
       1) Would you please tell us why the apportations that you produce
are only accomplished during the magnetic sleep of the medium?
       “Because of the medium’s nature. The phenomena that I
produce while he is sleeping I could equally produce in a different
medium who is awake.”
       2) Why do you take so long in bringing objects to us, and why
do you arouse the covetousness of the medium, exciting his desire to get
the promised object?
       “I need time to prepare the fluids that I will use to bring
the object. As for my exciting the medium, I often do it only to
entertain those present as well as the somnambulist himself.”
      Remark by Erastus: The spirit who has responded does not know any
      better. He is not aware of the usefulness of such covetous excitement,
      which he instinctively arouses without comprehending its effect.
      He thinks he uses it as entertainment, while he in fact unknowingly
      stimulates a greater emission of fluid. This is a result of the difficulty that


                                       137

                                   Chapter V


      this type of phenomenon presents, a difficulty that is even greater when
      it is not spontaneous – especially with some mediums.

       3) Since the production of this phenomenon depends on the
special nature of this particular medium, would it be possible to
produce it more easily and rapidly by using a different medium?
       “The production of the phenomenon depends on the nature
of this medium and it can only be produced by mediums of like
nature. As for rapidity, we find the habit of frequently using the
same medium to be of great help.”
       4) Can the individuals present influence the phenomenon somehow?
       “Whenever there is disbelief or opposition by some of
them, it can create serious problems for us. We prefer to perform
our experiments with believers and with those versed in Spiritism,
but that does not mean that ill will can completely paralyze us.”
       5) Where do you get the flowers and candy you bring to us?
       “I get the flowers from various gardens that I find pleasing.”
       6) And the candy? The candy maker must have noticed the
disappearance.
       “I get it wherever I like. The candy maker doesn’t notice
anything since I put other candy in its place.”
       7) But the rings are valuable; where did you get those? Haven’t
you harmed whomever you took them from?
       “I took them from places unknown to anybody and in a way
that it wouldn’t harm anyone.”
      Remark by Erastus: I think the matter was explained incompletely due to the
      lack of understanding of the spirit who responded. Yes, there could have been
      real harm, but this spirit did not want to appear to have stolen anything. An
      object can only be replaced by one that is identical, with the same shape and
      the same value. Hence, if the spirit saw the possibility of replacing an object
      that it took with a similar one, it would not have had any reason to take the
      object in the first place, because it could have simply used the replacement.

                    Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


       8) Is it possible to apport flowers from another planet?
       “No, that is not possible for me.”
       (To Erastus) “Do other spirits have such power?”
       (Erastus) “No, it is impossible because of the environmental
differences.”
       9) Could you bring flowers from another hemisphere – from the
tropics, for example?
       “Since it is still the earth, I can.”
       10) Can you make the objects you brought disappear and return
them?
       “As easily as I brought them. I could return them at will.”
       11) Isn’t producing the phenomenon of apportation troublesome
for you? Doesn’t it cause you any problems?
       “It isn’t troublesome when I have due permission. But it
could cause big problems if I wanted to produce them without
being authorized.”
      Remark by Erastus: He does not want to say that it is problematic,
      although it really is, because he is forced to perform an operation that is
      material, so to speak.

     12) What difficulties might you encounter?
     “None, besides bad fluidic conditions, which could be
unfavorable.”
     13) How do you bring the object? Do you carry it in your hands?
     “No. I enfold it within myself.”
      Remark by Erastus: He does not explain very clearly how he does it,
      because he does not actually enfold the object within his person.
      However, since his personal fluid can dilate itself, and is penetrable and
      expandable, he combines a portion of it with a portion of the medium’s
      own animalized fluid. It is within this mixture that he hides and carries
      the object chosen for apportation. So it is incorrect for him to say that
      he enfolds it within himself.


                                     139

                                    Chapter V


     14) Could you just as easily carry a heavier object – one hundred
pounds, for example?
     “Weight doesn’t matter. We bring flowers because they are
more pleasant than a weightier object.”
      Remark by Erastus: That is correct. He could carry two hundred or four
      hundred-pound objects, because the gravity that exists for you is non-existent
      for him. But here again he does not really understand what is happening.
      The mass of the combined fluids is proportional to the mass of the object.
      In other words, the force must be in proportion to the resistance. Thus, if a
      spirit only carries a flower or other light object, it is often because it cannot
      find either in the medium or itself the elements needed for any greater effort.

      15) Are there cases where objects disappear for some unknown
reason, but which are in fact taken by spirits?
      “That happens a lot – more often than you might think. It
may be remedied by simply asking the spirit to return the object
that disappeared.”
      Remark by Erastus: That is true, but sometimes what has been taken
      is taken for good, because such objects that disappear from the house
      are almost always taken a long ways away. However, since the taking of
      objects requires the same fluidic conditions as apportations, it can only
      occur with the help of a medium endowed with special faculties. Thus,
      when something has disappeared, it much more likely happened due to
      your own carelessness rather than because of some spirit.

      16) Are there some instances that we regard as natural
phenomena, but which are actually due to the action of certain spirits?
      “Your days are filled with such occurrences that you don’t
understand, because you have not thought about them, but which
with a little reflection you could clearly see.”
      Remark by Erastus: You mustn’t attribute to spirits what has actually
      resulted from human effort. However, you should believe in their



                                        140

                    Spontaneous Physical Manifestations


      concealed and continuous influence, which produces all around you a
      thousand circumstances, thousands of incidents that are required for
      fulfilling your actions and existence.

       17) Among the various objects used in apportations, aren’t
there those that can be fabricated by the spirits themselves; that is,
spontaneously produced by the modifications they can perform on the
fluid or universal element?
       “I myself can’t do it because I don’t have permission. Only a
high order spirit could do it.”
       18) The other day, how did you introduce those objects into the
room while the doors were shut?
       “I brought them with me, enfolded, like I said, within
my own substance. I don’t know what else to say, since it is
inexplicable.”
       19) How did you make objects that were invisible a moment
before become visible?
       “I withdrew the matter that had enveloped them.”
      Remark by Erastus: It is not matter per se that had enveloped them, but
      rather a fluid taken half from the perispirit of the medium and half from
      the spirit.”

       20) (To Erastus) Can an object be carried into a completely
sealed place; in other words, can the spirit spiritualize a material
object so that it can pass through matter?
       (Erastus) “That is a complex question. The spirit can render
the objects it carries invisible but not penetrable. It cannot undo
the aggregation of matter, which would be the destruction of the
object. But by making it invisible, it can carry it wherever it wants
and free it at the best time to make it appear. It is quite a different
matter with objects that we compose ourselves. In these cases, we
only introduce the elements of matter, and since these elements
are essentially penetrable (since we ourselves can penetrate and


                                     141

                                        Chapter V


cross through denser objects with the same ease that solar rays pass
through a window), we can certainly state that we can introduce
an object into a place no matter how closed up it may be – but
only in such a particular case.19

        Questions concerning Apparitions
       100. Of all spirit manifestations, the most interesting
are undoubtedly those in which spirits can render themselves
visible. From an examination of this type of phenomenon we will
see that, like all the others, there is nothing at all supernatural
about it. First, we will provide the responses by the Spirits on
the subject.
       1) Can spirits render themselves visible?
       “Yes, especially during sleep. However, certain individuals
can also see them while awake, although that is less frequent.”
      While the body rests, the spirit loosens the material ties, becomes freer
      and can more easily see other spirits and communicate with them. A
      dream is only a recollection of this state. When we remember nothing,
      we say that we have not dreamed at all, but the soul has nevertheless



                                    143

                                          Chapter VI


           seen and enjoyed its liberty. Here, we are dealing more particularly with
           apparitions that occur during the waking state.20

        2) Do spirits who visibly manifest themselves belong more to one
specific category than to another?
        “No. They can belong to all the categories – the highest
down to the lowest.”
        3) Are all spirits permitted to manifest themselves visibly?
        “All may do so, but they do not always receive permission or
even desire to.”
        4) For what purpose do they manifest themselves visibly?
        “It depends on their nature; their purpose may be either
good or evil.”
        5) Why would they be permitted if their purpose is evil?
        “It would be allowed to test those to whom they appear. Thus,
the spirit’s intention may be evil, but the result may be good.”
        6) What is the purpose of spirits who render themselves visible
with evil intentions?
        “They appear out of a desire to frighten, and often out of
revenge.”
        – What is the purpose of spirits who appear with good intentions?
        “To console those who are mourning their departure in
order to prove to them that they continue to exist and are close by.
They might also appear to give advice and sometimes to ask for
assistance for themselves.”
        7) What harm would there be if the possibility of seeing spirits
were permanent and widespread among human beings? Wouldn’t that
be a way to remove all doubt from the minds of disbelievers?
        “Since human beings are constantly surrounded by spirits,
it would be troublesome and would hamper them in their daily
activities if they could see spirits all the time. It would also in
20
     Concerning the state of the spirit during sleep see The Spirits’ Book, The Emancipation of
     the Soul, no. 409 – Auth.



                                              144

                            Visual Manifestations


most cases take away their initiative, while, on the other hand, if
they believe that they are alone, they will act more freely. As for
disbelievers, there are many other means available for them to be
convinced if they would take advantage of them and if they were
not blinded by pride. You are well aware that there are people who
have seen but do not believe nonetheless because they say that they
have experienced an illusion. Do not be concerned about such
people; God is responsible for them.”
       It would be very inconvenient if we were able to see spirits about us
       all the time. It would be like seeing the air that surrounds us, or the
       myriad of microscopic animals that swarm around us. From this we
       must conclude that what God has done is well done, and that God
       knows better than we do what is best for us.

       8) If being able to see spirits might be inconvenient, why is it
permitted in certain cases?
       “To provide proof that everything does not end with the
death of the body and that the soul retains its individuality after
death. This temporary glimpse is enough to provide such proof and
to attest to the presence of your friends at your side, but it is not as
inconvenient as being able to see them all the time would be.”
       9) On more highly evolved worlds than our own, are spirits seen
more frequently?
       “The more humans approach their spirit nature, the easier it
becomes for them to communicate with spirits. It is because your
bodies are so dense that it is rarer and more difficult to perceive
ethereal beings.”
       10) Is it reasonable to be frightened at the apparition of a spirit?
       “Anyone who reflects on the matter will understand that a
spirit, whatever it may appear as, is less dangerous than a living
person. Moreover, spirits go everywhere and you do not have to
see them in order to know that they are at your side. A spirit who


                                    145

                                Chapter VI


desires to harm someone can do so more surely without being
seen. A spirit is not dangerous because it is a spirit, but because of
the influence it can exert upon a person’s thoughts, drawing him
or her away from the good and pushing him or her toward evil.”
      People who are afraid of the dark and of being alone rarely
      comprehend the cause of their fear. They would not know what to
      say if asked what they are afraid of, but they should certainly be
      more afraid of meeting other human beings than spirits because an
      evildoer is more dangerous while alive than after death. A lady whom
      we know saw an apparition one night in her room. It was so well
      defined that she believed that there was actually someone present.
      Her first sensation was terror; however, upon assuring herself that
      there was no one else, she said to herself, “It looks like it was only a
      spirit, so I can sleep in peace.”

        11) Can anyone who sees a spirit talk to it?
        “Certainly. And that is exactly what should be done in such
a case. Ask the spirit who it is, what it wants and what can be done
for it. If it is unhappy and suffering, showing sympathy will bring
it relief. If it is a benevolent spirit, it may intend to offer good
advice.”
        – In such cases, how will the spirit respond?
        “Sometimes by articulating sounds as a living person would,
but usually by transmitting its thoughts.”
        12) Do spirits who appear to have wings really have them or are
they only a symbolic appearance?
        “Spirits do not have wings. They do not need them since
as spirits they can go anywhere. But they appear in this form in
order to impress the person to whom they show themselves: some
appear wearing their normal clothing, others in drapery and some
with wings, as a characterization of the spiritual category they are
representing.”

                           Visual Manifestations


       13) Are the persons we see while dreaming always who they
appear to be?
       “They are almost always the same ones; your spirit goes to
meet them or they come to meet you.”
       14) Couldn’t deceptive spirits take on the appearance of someone
dear to us in order to mislead us?
       “They take on fantastic appearances only in order to have
fun at your expense, but there are matters that they are not allowed
to play with.”
       15) Since thought is a kind of evocation, we can understand that
it can induce a spirit to appear. But why is it that the persons whom we
think about the most and whom we most ardently desire to see again
almost never appear to us in our dreams, while we often see others who
do not interest us in the least and whom we never think about?
       “It is not always possible for spirits to show themselves
visibly even in dreams and in spite of your desire to see them.
Causes apart from their will may prevent them. Besides, it is almost
always a trial, which even your most ardent desire cannot avert. As
for individuals who do not interest you, it is possible that they
are thinking of you, even though you are not thinking of them.
Moreover, you have no idea about relationships in the spirit world,
where you might meet up with a multitude of close, old and new
acquaintances, whom you have no memory of at all while awake.”
      When there is no means of verifying visions or apparitions, we can
      almost certainly treat them as being only hallucinations. However, when
      they are confirmed by the circumstances, we cannot attribute them
      to our imagination. Such are, for example, apparitions at the time of
      death – while asleep or awake – involving persons whom we had not
      been thinking about, and who by various signs have come to reveal the
      absolutely unexpected circumstances of their passing. In such instances,
      we have seen horses rear up and balk before apparitions that frightened
      their riders. Imagination may be something that humans are endowed


                                    147

                                Chapter VI


      with, but the same cannot be said for animals. Moreover, if the images
      we see while dreaming are always the result of our waking concerns, that
      would not explain why we hardly ever dream of the matters that we have
      been thinking about the most.

       16) Why do certain visions happen more frequently during illness?
       “They happen just as frequently in the state of perfect health,
but during illness the material ties loosen and the weakness of the
body allows more freedom to the spirit, which then more easily
communicates with other spirits.”
       17) Spontaneous apparitions seem to occur more often in certain
countries. Are the members of some cultures more gifted than others at
receiving these manifestations?
       “Have you made a historical registration of every apparition?
Apparitions, noises and all other manifestations occur equally all
over the world, but they display their own particular characteristics
according to the cultures among which they occur. For example,
among those where writing is not very widespread there are no
writing mediums; among others they abound. Also, among the
former, manifestations involving noises and movements of objects
are more frequent than intelligent communications, which are less
appreciated and sought after.”
       18) Why do apparitions occur more at night? Mightn’t this show
that they are the effect of silence and darkness upon one’s imagination?
       “For the same reason you see the stars at night and not in
full daylight. Intense lighting can eclipse a delicate apparition.
Nevertheless, it is wrong to suppose that night has something
special about it in this regard. Question those who have seen
apparitions and you will find that most have actually occurred
during the day.”
      The phenomena of apparitions are much more frequent and common
      than one might think, but many persons do not reveal them either

      because they fear being ridiculed or because they attribute them to
      illusion. If they seem to occur more abundantly among certain cultures
      it is because such cultures have more carefully preserved their correct
      or erroneous traditions, which are almost always exaggerated by a
      fascination for the extraordinary in areas that are more or less disposed
      to them. Furthermore, credulity sees supernatural effects in the most
      ordinary phenomena: the silence of solitude, the steep slope of ravines,
      the rustle of trees, the roar of storms, the echo from mountains, the
      fantastic shapes of clouds, shadows and mirages. Anything can lend itself
      to deluding simple and naively imaginative people, who recount in good
      faith what they have seen or believe they have seen. However, alongside
      fiction there is reality, and a serious study of Spiritism can set people free
      from the foolish accessories of superstition.

       19) Does the seeing of spirits occur in the normal state or only
during ecstasy?
       “It can occur under perfectly normal conditions; however,
those who see them are almost always in a special state which
approaches ecstasy, and which gives them a kind of second sight.”
(See The Spirits’ Book, no. 447)
       20) Do those who see spirits do so with their eyes?
       “They think they do, but in reality it is their soul that sees
them. This is proven by the fact that they can still see them with
their eyes closed.”
       21) How can a spirit render itself visible?
       “The principle is the same as for all other manifestations.
It resides in the properties of the perispirit, which can undergo as
many modifications as the spirit sees fit.”
       22) Can a spirit per se make itself visible or can it only do so
with the aid of the perispirit?
       “In your material state, spirits can only manifest themselves
with the aid of their semi-material envelope, which is the
intermediary through which they act upon your senses. Under this

                                      149

                                Chapter VI


envelope, they can appear in human form or any other, whether in
dreams or in the waking state, whether in full light or in darkness.”
       23) Could we say that it is through a condensation of the
perispirit’s fluid that the spirit makes itself visible?
       “Condensation is not the right word. It only serves to make
a comparison that can help you understand the phenomenon,
while in reality there is no actual condensation. The combining of
fluids produces a special condition in the perispirit which has no
analogy for you but which renders the spirit visible nonetheless.”
       24) Are the spirits who appear always intangible and
inaccessible?
       “In their normal state they are intangible like in a dream.
Nevertheless, they can make an impression upon your sense of
touch and leave signs of their presence. In some cases, they can
even render themselves tangible for a moment, which proves the
existence of some kind of matter between them and you.”
       25) Is everyone capable of seeing spirits?
       “During sleep, yes, but not while awake. During sleep, the
soul sees directly without an intermediary; while you are awake,
the soul is influenced by the organs to different degrees. Thus, the
conditions are not the same in the two instances.”
       26) What does the faculty for seeing spirits in the waking state
depend on?
       “It depends on the organism and the greater or lesser ease
with which the fluid of the seer combines with that of the spirit.
Hence, it is not enough for the spirit simply to want to show itself;
the spirit must find the required aptitude in the individual to
whom it wants to show itself.”
       – Can this faculty be developed through practice?
       “It can be as can all other faculties. However, it is a faculty that
is better left to develop naturally rather than artificially, because in
the latter case there is a risk of overexciting the imagination. The


                                   150

                                   Visual Manifestations


common and permanent ability to see spirits is exceptional and
normal human conditions are not conducive to it.”
       27) Can spirit apparitions be artificially induced?
       “Sometimes that is possible, but very rarely. They are almost
always spontaneous. For someone to see spirits, they must be
endowed with a special faculty.”
       28) Can spirits render themselves visible in other forms besides
the human one?
       “The human form is the normal one. A spirit can vary its
appearance, but it nearly always retains the human form.”
       – Can’t they appear in the form of a flame?
       “They can produce flames of light as well as any other
effect to demonstrate their presence, but such attributes are not
of the spirits themselves. A flame is usually an optical effect or an
emanation of the perispirit. In every case it is only a part of the
perispirit, which only appears in its entirety during visions.”
       29) What are we to think of the belief that attributes will-o’-
the-wisps to souls or spirits?
       “Superstition resulting from ignorance. The physical cause
of will-o’-the-wisps is well known.”
       – Was the blue flame that appeared over the head of Servius
Tullius21 while he was an infant real or only a legend?
       “It was real, produced by his familiar spirit, who wanted to
warn his mother. Because she was a seeing medium, she saw the
radiation of her son’s protector spirit. Seeing mediums vary in their
degree of perception just as writing mediums vary in their ability
to write. While this mother saw only a flame, another medium
might have seen the spirit itself.”
       30) Can spirits show themselves in the form of an animal?
       “That can happen, but low order spirits are always the
ones who take on such appearances. In every case, however, it is a

temporary appearance, because it would be absurd to believe that
an animal could be the incarnation of a spirit. Animals are always
animals and nothing more.”
      Only sheer superstition could lead to the belief that certain animals are
      incarnations of spirits. One would have to have a very complacent or
      impressionable imagination to see something supernatural in the somewhat
      bizarre circumstances in which animals sometimes present themselves. Fear
      often causes one to see something that does not really exist. Nonetheless,
      fear is not always the source of this idea. We knew a lady, who was in fact
      quite intelligent, who was extremely fond of a certain black cat because she
      believed that it possessed a supra-animal nature. However, she had never
      heard mention of Spiritism. If she had been familiar with it, she would have
      understood how foolish her predilection was, since the Doctrine would
      have disclosed the impossibility of such a metamorphosis.



         Theoretical Essay on Apparitions
       101. The most common manifestations of apparitions
occur in dreams during sleep. These are visions. We cannot here
examine all the particularities that dreams can present, but we
will sum them up by stating what they may be: an actual vision
of present or absent things; a retrospective vision of the past; in
certain exceptional cases, a presentiment of the future. Frequently,
they are also allegorical images that good spirits present to us as
useful warnings or beneficial advice; if they are imperfect spirits,
they may use them to mislead us and encourage our passions. The
theory that follows below is applicable to dreams and all other
cases of apparitions. (See The Spirits’ Book, nos. 400 ff.)
       We shall not offend our readers’ common sense if we refute
the absurd and foolish notions of what is entailed in popular dream
interpretation.


                                      152

                         Visual Manifestations


        102. Apparitions per se occur during the waking state,
when the individual is in full enjoyment and has the complete
freedom of his or her faculties. They generally appear in a vaporous
and diaphanous form that is sometimes vague and indistinct.
When they first appear, they are almost always a whitish light,
whose contours gradually become more definite. At other times,
their forms are clearly accentuated and the minutest traces of the
face can be distinguished to such a degree that it can be precisely
described. Their appearance and other characteristics are similar to
those of the spirit when it was incarnate.
        Since a spirit can assume any appearance, it presents itself
with the one by which it can best be identified, if that is what it
wants. Thus, even though it has no actual corporeal handicap as a
spirit, it may appear to be maimed, lame, humpbacked, wounded
or scarred if that is what is needed to identify it. For example,
Aesop is not deformed as a spirit, but if we would evoke him,
he would appear ugly and humpbacked, wearing his traditional
garb no matter how many lives he has lived in the meantime. One
particularity worth noting is that except in special circumstances
the least precise components of an apparition are the lower limbs,
while the head, torso, arms and hands appear clearly. Hence, we
almost never see them walk – they glide like shadows. As for their
garments, they are usually comprised of a sort of drapery that ends
in long flowing folds. Spirits who have retained nothing of their
earthly life appear with flowing and graceful hair, but the ordinary
spirits of individuals with whom we are familiar usually dress as
they did during the final days of their existence.
        Quite often, they display attributes that are characteristic of
their elevation such as a halo or wings, leading them to be regarded
as angels. Others carry symbols that remind us of their earthly
activities: a warrior might appear in armor, a scholar with books,
an assassin with a dagger, and so on. Highly evolved spirits display


                                 153

                             Chapter VI


a beautiful, noble and serene figure, whereas the least evolved
ones have something ferocious and bestial about them, sometimes
still bearing vestiges of the crimes they committed or the tortures
they suffered. The issue of clothing and accessories is perhaps the
most intriguing. We shall return to discuss this in a special chapter
because it is connected with other very important issues.
       103. We have stated that apparitions have something
vaporous about them. In some cases, we could compare them to
the image reflected in an un-silvered mirror, where, despite its
clearness we may also see objects that are behind the mirror. This
is how seeing mediums usually perceive them. They see them
come and go, enter a room or leave, circulate amongst a crowd
of living persons – at least when it comes to ordinary spirits, who
take an interest in everything, listen to everything that is said and
take an active part in all that goes on around them. Good spirits
are often seen to approach individuals in order to whisper ideas to
them, to influence and comfort them, while evil spirits do so in
order to mock them and to show disappointment or satisfaction
at the results. In other words, spirits are the counterpart of the
corporeal world.
       Thus is that secret world surrounding us, in the midst
of which we live without even suspecting it, just as we live
among the myriad beings of the microscopic world. The
microscope has revealed the infinitely tiny world, which we
never suspected to exist; Spiritism, with the help of seeing
mediums, has revealed the spirit world to us, which is also
one of the active forces of nature. With the aid of such seeing
mediums we have been able to study the invisible world and to
be initiated into its customs in the same way that a culture of
blind individuals would be able to study the visible world with
the help of sighted persons. (See chap. XIV on Mediums, the
section referring to seeing mediums)

                                154

                                 Visual Manifestations


       104. A spirit who so desires and who is actually able to
appear sometimes assumes an even more defined form, with all
the appearances of a solid body, to the point of displaying a perfect
illusion and leading us to believe that we are dealing with an actual
corporeal being. In some cases and under certain circumstances,
an apparition’s tangibility can become real, meaning that we can
touch and handle it, and feel its resistance and heat as if it were a
living body. Nevertheless, such characteristics do not prevent the
apparition from vanishing as quickly as a flash of lightning. In
these cases, its presence is not only verified with the eyes, but with
the touch as well.
       If we could attribute the occurrence of a simple visual
apparition to illusion or a kind of delusion, there can be no more
doubt when we can hold and feel it, and when it can hold and hug
us; however, tangible apparitions are the rarest. Nevertheless, those
which have appeared of late under the influence of a few powerful
mediums22, and which have been completely authenticated
by blameless witnesses, prove and explain the historical records
involving persons who have reappeared after death with all the
appearances of reality. Moreover, as we have already pointed out,
in spite of how extraordinary such phenomena might seem, they
lose all their extraordinary character when we know about the
way in which they are produced and when we understand that,
far from representing a derogation from natural laws, they only
display a new application of them.
       105. By its very nature and in its normal state, the perispirit
is invisible. The same may be said of countless fluids that we know
to exist, but which we have never seen. But like certain fluids, it
can undergo modifications that render it visible, whether by a sort
of condensation or by a change in its molecular arrangement. This

22
     Mr. Home, among others – Auth.



                                         155

                              Chapter VI


is when it can appear to us in a vaporous form. Condensation
(we must not take this word literally; we only use it due to the
lack of another and as a simple instrument of comparison) can
be such that the perispirit acquires the properties of a solid and
tangible body, but it can instantaneously return to its ethereal and
invisible state. We can understand this process by comparing it to
steam, which can go from invisibility to a mist, then to a liquid
and finally to a solid, and vice-versa.
       These diverse states of the perispirit, however, are due to
the will of the spirit itself and not to physical or outside causes,
as is the case with our gases. A spirit can appear to us when it
places its perispirit in the state necessary to become visible, but
a simple desire is not enough to produce the effect because the
modification of the perispirit can only occur when it combines its
own fluids with the specific fluid of a medium. This combining is
not always possible, which explains why it is uncommon for spirits
to make themselves visible.
       Consequently, it is not enough for the spirit to want to appear
or for a person to want to see it; the combining of the fluids of
both is required, which means that there must be a kind of affinity
between them, and also that the emission of the medium’s fluid
must be quite abundant in order to bring about the perispirit’s
transformation. There are probably other conditions that we do not
yet know about. Finally, the spirit must have received permission to
appear to a person, which is not always granted, and if so, only in
certain circumstances for reasons that we are not yet able to ascertain.
        106. Another property of the perispirit is the penetrability
inherent to its ethereal nature. No type of matter can obstruct
it; it can pass through anything as easily as light passes through
transparent objects. Hence, there are no means of preventing
spirits from entering a place. They can visit prisoners in their cells
as easily as they can visit someone in the middle of an open field.

                         Visual Manifestations


      107. Apparitions during the waking state are not rare, nor
do they comprise a novelty; they have occurred throughout history,
which offers us a large number of such cases. However, without
having to resort to the past, they have frequently been encountered
in our own times. Many people have seen them and have at first
taken them for what convention has called hallucinations. They are
especially common in cases where persons have died somewhere
far away, and have come to visit relatives and friends. They often
do not have a clear objective, but we can state that spirits who
appear in this way are generally drawn to do so out of sympathy.
If we would examine our memories, we would find that there are
few people who have not heard of incidents of this kind, and their
authenticity can no longer be held in doubt.

                      Globular Spirits
        108. To the foregoing considerations we shall add an
examination of certain optical effects that have given rise to the
strange theory of globular spirits.
        Often, the air is not entirely clean and at such times the
currents of aeriform molecules and their heat-produced movement
can become perfectly visible. Some people have actually taken
this phenomenon to be masses of spirits fluttering around in the
air. It is enough only to mention this theory in order to refute it;
nonetheless, there is another kind of illusion that is no less bizarre,
and against which we must also be on guard.
        The watery fluid in the eye sometimes contains specks
that are barely perceptible and which have lost some of their
transparency. These specks are like opaque objects suspended in
the fluid, whose movement they follow. They appear as tiny disks,
barely one sixteenth of an inch in diameter but augmented by
refraction – which appear to float in the air some distance away.


                                 157

                             Chapter VI


We have seen people take these disks to be spirits who follow them
everywhere, and in their enthusiasm they see figures in the nuances
of the iridescence. This is about as rational as seeing the figure of
a man on the moon. It would only take a simple observation on
their part to bring themselves back to reality.
       They say that these disks or medallions not only follow them
but that they also duplicate their movements; they go to the right
and to the left, up and down, or stop, according to their head
movements. There is nothing strange about this, since the seat of
the phenomenon lies in the ocular globe and must naturally obey
its movements. If they were actually spirits, people would have to
admit that the disks display a too-highly mechanical movement
for intelligent and free beings – a tiresome role, even for low
order spirits – and a role even more incompatible with our ideas
concerning high order spirits. Some people have even taken the
black or opaque specks that sometimes appear in the eye to be
evil spirits.
       Both the disks and the black specks have a wave-like
movement that is restricted to a certain angle, and what increases
the illusion is that they do not abruptly follow the movements of
the line of vision. The reason is simple. The opaque specks in the
watery fluid – the primary cause of the phenomenon – are, as we
have stated, suspended in the liquid and tend to float downwards.
When they rise, they do so with the movement of the eyes from
the bottom upwards, but when they reach a certain height, they
become fixed, and they are seen to float back down and stop by
themselves. They are extremely mobile because it only takes an
imperceptible movement of the eye to make them change direction
and quickly travel the whole width of the arc in the space where
the image is produced. As long as it has not been proven that an
image has its own spontaneous and intelligent movement, one can
only see it as an optical and physiological phenomenon.


                                158

                           Visual Manifestations


        The same thing happens with the ‘stars’ sometimes produced
by the contraction of the eye muscles, and which appear in more or
less tight bunches. These are probably due to the phosphorescent
electricity of the iris because they are usually confined to the circle
of that part of the eye.
        Similar types of these illusions can only be the result of imperfect
observation. Whoever has seriously studied the nature of spirits
through the means offered by practical Spiritism will understand how
naïve they are. Just as we combat the foolhardy theories that attack
spirit communications when such theories are based on an ignorance
of the facts, we must also seek to destroy the erroneous ideas that result
more from enthusiasm than mental reflection, and which therefore
cause more harm than good to disbelievers, who are already naturally
disposed to looking for the ridiculous side of the matter.
       109. As we have seen, the perispirit is the principle for all
manifestations. Understanding it has given us the key to numerous
phenomena; it has led to a large advance in Spiritist science and
has enabled it to enter upon a new path by removing any relic
of the miraculous from it. Thanks to the Spirits themselves
(we must always point out that it was they who taught us the
way), we have found in the perispirit an explanation for spirits’
action upon matter, the moving about of inert objects, noises
and apparitions. In the perispirit we will find an explanation for
many other phenomena yet to be examined before proceeding to
a study of the communications per se. We will understand these
communications much better the more completely we understand
their fundamental causes. If we understand this principle, it will
be easier for us to apply it to the various phenomena that may
present themselves for observation.
      110. However, far be it from us to regard the theory that we
are presenting as absolute and as being the last word on the issue.


                                    159

                             Chapter VI


It will undoubtedly be completed or corrected later on through
new studies, but no matter how incomplete or imperfect it may be
at present, it can always help if we understand the possibility of the
phenomena resulting from causes that have nothing supernatural
about them. If it is a theory, we nevertheless cannot deny the merit
of its reasonableness and probability, and that it is worth as much
as all the explanations that our detractors have attempted to use
in order to prove that everything involving spirit phenomena is no
more than illusion, phantasmagoria and deception.

              The Hallucination Theory
       111. Those who do not accept the existence of the
incorporeal and invisible world think they can explain everything
away with the word hallucination. The definition of this word is
well known: it means the error, the illusion of those who believe
they experience certain perceptions when in fact they do not (it
comes from the Latin allucinari, to err, from ad lucem). But we
know that scholars still have not explained its physiological cause.
       Since it seems that optics and physiology no longer hold
any secrets from these learned individuals, why haven’t they been
able to explain the nature and origin of the images that are shown
to the spirit under certain circumstances? They want to explain
everything using the laws of matter, and should therefore be able
to provide a theory of hallucination based upon such laws – good
or bad, it would at least be an explanation.
      112. The cause of dreams has never been explained by
science. It attributes them to an effect of the imagination but it
does not tell us what this imagination is or how it produces the
images that are so clear and distinct, which at times appear to us.
Thus, they explain one unknown thing with another that is even


                                 160

                           Visual Manifestations


less known – everything remains the same. They say that dreams
should be regarded as a memory of our waking state concerns.
However, even if we were to accept this solution, it would actually
resolve nothing; we would still need to know what this magic
mirror is that retains the impression of such concerns. Above all,
how can they explain the visions of real things that we have never
seen before or thought of in the waking state? Only Spiritism
can provide us with the key to those strange phenomena that
pass unnoticed simply because they are so common, as are all the
wonders of nature that we so undervalue.
       Scholars have not wanted to deal with hallucinations,
but whether they are real or not, they are a phenomenon that
physiology should be able to explain; otherwise, it would run the
risk of exposing its incompetence. If someday a scholar were to
decide to give not only a definition but a physiological explanation
of this phenomenon, we would still have to see if that theory
resolved all the cases, if it omitted the very common occurrences
of apparitions of persons at the moment of death, and if it clarified
the coincidence of the person’s apparition with his or her death.
If these were isolated events, they might be attributed to chance,
but since they are quite frequent, chance cannot produce such
recurrences. If the one who saw the apparition had had the notion
that the person was about to die, then fine; however, in most cases,
the apparition involves someone who was not thought about in
the least. Consequently, imagination has nothing to do with it.
       Still less can the knowledge about the completely unknown
circumstances of death be explained away by imagination. The
adherents of the hallucination theory will state that the soul (if they
in fact believe in the soul) undergoes moments of over-excitation,
in which the faculties are heightened. We would agree, but when
what the soul sees is real, it cannot be treated as an illusion. If in this
heightened excitation the soul sees something that is not present, it


                                   161

                                Chapter VI


is because it goes to where that something actually is, and if our soul
can go to a person who is not present, then why couldn’t the soul of
the absent person come to us just as easily? Let those who adhere to
the hallucination theory take such facts into consideration and not
forget that a theory that is contradicted by the facts is necessarily
erroneous or incomplete. While we await their explanation, we
shall try to provide some ideas of our own on the matter.
       113. The facts prove that there are true apparitions,
which the Spiritist theory explains perfectly, and which can only
be denied by those who accept nothing beyond the physical
organism. However, apart from these real visions, aren’t there also
hallucinations in the normal sense of the word? We cannot doubt
it. But what is their cause? The Spirits themselves have sent us in
the right direction, and they have given us a complete explanation
in their responses to the following questions:
       – Are sightings of apparitions always real or are they sometimes
an effect of hallucination? When we see the Devil, for example, or other
fantastic things while dreaming or in some other way, and which we know
could not possibly exist, isn’t it due to nothing more than imagination?
       “Yes, sometimes, as when someone is affected by reading
certain materials or by stories of witchcraft, and then recalls
them and believes he or she is seeing what does not, in fact, exist.
However, we have also already stated that a spirit, by means of its
semi-material envelope, can take on all sorts of shapes in order to
manifest itself. Thus, a mocking spirit can appear with horns and
claws if it wants to in order to mock the gullible, just as a good
spirit may show itself with wings and a shining appearance.”
       – May we regard as apparitions the faces and other images that often
appear when we are half asleep or when we simply have our eyes closed?
       “When the senses go numb, the spirit frees itself and can
see close or far away what it would not be able to see with the
eyes. These images are almost always visions, but they can also be

                                   162

                         Visual Manifestations


the effect of impressions that the sight of certain objects have left
on the brain, which retains their outline just as it retains sounds.
The freed spirit then sees in its own mind the impressions fixed
therein like on a photographic plate. The variety and mixture of
such impressions form bizarre and fleeting combinations that
almost always immediately disappear despite every effort made to
retain them. These fantastic apparitions should be attributed to
a similar cause and they have nothing real about them; they are
often produced during illness.”
        It is an accepted fact that the memory is the result of the
impressions retained by the brain. But by what strange phenomenon
is it that these impressions, so varied and numerous, are not to be
confused with one another? That is an impenetrable mystery, but
it is no more strange than the sound waves that crisscross through
the air, but which retain their own distinctness. In a sound and
well organized brain, these impressions are clear and precise; in a
less favorable state, they are diluted and become confused; hence
the reason for the loss of recollection or the confusion of ideas.
This seems less strange if one accepts, as in phrenology, a special
destination for each part or even for each fiber of the brain.
        The images transmitted to the brain by the eyes leave their
impression on it, which enables one to remember a picture as if it
were still present, although this should always be regarded as an act
of the memory since nothing is in fact seen. Moreover, in the state
of emancipation, the soul can see the brain and find those images
in it, especially those that have impressed it the most according to
the nature of the spirit’s preoccupations or its inner dispositions.
That is how it recalls the impressions of religious, diabolical,
dramatic or mundane scenes, as well as bizarre animal-like figures
that it had seen sometime before in a painting or had heard about
in a story, because these also leave their impressions. Thus, the soul
really sees, but it only sees a photographic image in the brain.

                             Chapter VI


        In the normal state, these images are fleeting and ephemeral
because all sections of the brain are functioning freely. During an
illness, however, the brain is weaker and the normal equilibrium
in the parts of the brain disappears; only some of the parts remain
active while others are more or less paralyzed. This results in the
permanence of certain images that are not erased as they would
be in the normal state regarding external affairs. This is a true
hallucination and the main cause of idées fixes.
        One can see that we have explained this anomaly with a
well known physiological law – that of cerebral impressions –
but it is also always necessary to take the soul’s intervention into
consideration. If the materialists have not yet been able to give a
satisfactory solution for the phenomenon, it is because they have
not wanted to believe in the soul. Thus, they will say that our
explanation is erroneous because it is supported by a contested
principle. Contested by whom? By them. However, it has been
accepted by the great majority since humankind has existed on the
earth. The denial by a few does not comprise a law.
        Has our explanation been satisfactory? We have provided
it for what it is worth in the absence of some other, and, if
you wish, we might call it a simple hypothesis while awaiting
something better. As it is, can it explain all the cases involving
visions? Certainly not, but we challenge all physiologists to present
one that, according to their exclusivist opinions, can explain all
of them. However, when they proffer their sacramental words
of over-excitation and heightened imagination, they actually
pronounce nothing at all. So, if all the theories about hallucination
are insufficient for explaining all the facts, it is because there is
something more involved than hallucinations per se. Our theory
would be incorrect if we applied it to all cases involving visions,
however, because some would contradict it; it is correct insofar as
it is applied only to certain effects.

       Apparitions of Spirits of the Living
       114. Bi-corporeality and transfiguration are two varieties of
visual manifestations. As extraordinary as they might seem at first
sight, it will be easy to realize through the explanations that may
be given for them that they are not outside the order of natural
phenomena. Both are based upon the principle that everything
that has been stated concerning the properties of the perispirit
after death applies to the perispirit of the living as well.
       We know that during sleep the spirit partially recovers
its freedom; i.e., it isolates itself from the body, and it is in this
state that we often have the opportunity to observe it. But the
spirit of both the living and the dead always retains its semi-
material envelope, which, for the same causes that have already

                                 165

                             Chapter VII


been referred to, can acquire visibility and tangibility. There have
been well proven cases that can leave no doubt on this point. We
will cite only a few examples that we know about personally and
whose truthfulness we can guarantee. Additionally, everybody can
consult their memory and add their own examples.
        115. The wife of a friend of ours repeatedly saw entering her
bedroom during the night, whether the light was on or off, a woman
who sold fruit in the neighborhood, and whom she recognized by
sight but with whom she had never spoken. This apparition left
her very frightened especially because at the time she new nothing
about Spiritism and because the phenomenon frequently repeated
itself. The woman was perfectly alive and was certainly asleep at
that time of the night; however, while her physical body was at
home, her spirit and fluidic body were in the other woman’s house.
What was the reason for this? We do not know. In this case, an
experienced Spiritist would have asked her what she wanted, but
the idea never even occurred to our friend’s wife. The apparition
always disappeared without the wife knowing how, and always after
its disappearance she would make sure that all the doors had been
tightly shut and that no one could have possibly entered her room.
        This precaution proves that she was wide awake and was not
fooled by a dream. On another occasion she saw an unknown man
in the same way. However, one day she saw her brother, who was
living in California. His appearance was so real at first sight that
she thought he had returned and wanted to speak to her, but he
disappeared without giving her the opportunity. Later, she received
a letter from him that proved he had not died. This woman was
what may be called a natural seeing medium, but at that time, as
we have already stated, she had never even heard of mediums.
      116. Another lady who resides out in the country was
seriously ill, and one particular night at around 10:00 she saw an


                                166

                   Bi-Corporeality and Transfiguration


older gentleman from her city, whom she had sometimes seen at
social functions, but with whom she had no closer relationship.
He was sitting in an armchair at the foot of her bed, and now and
then would take a pinch of snuff. He seemed to be watching over
her. Surprised at having a visitor at such an hour, she wanted to
ask him why he was there, but the gentleman made a sign for her
not to talk, but rather to go back to sleep. She tried several times to
speak to him, but each time he repeated his silent recommendation
and she would fall back to sleep.
       A few days later, after she had recovered from her illness, she
received a visit from the same gentleman; however, at a convenient
hour and actually in person this time. He was dressed in the same
manner with the same snuffbox and displayed the same mannerisms.
Certain that he had visited her during her illness, she thanked him
for the effort he had made. However, he was quite surprised and said
that he had not had the pleasure of seeing her for a long time. The
lady was familiar with spirit phenomena, and thus understood what
had transpired, but she did not wish to go into explanations and
was content with telling him that it had probably just been a dream.
       Disbelievers will say that it was in fact a dream – those
know-it-alls, who believe themselves to be enlightened individuals.
However, it is a fact that this woman had been no more asleep
than the other one. Was it a waking dream or, in other words,
a hallucination? That is the final catchphrase, the universal
explanation for everything that they cannot comprehend. Since
we have already sufficiently refuted this objection, we shall proceed
on behalf of those who are able to understand us.
      117. Here is a more characteristic case and we would be
curious to see if it can be explained away as being a simple play of
the imagination.
      A certain gentleman, who lived out in the country, never
wanted to marry despite his family’s entreaties. They were

                                  167

                             Chapter VII


particularly insistent that he meet a young lady from a neighboring
city, whom he had never seen. One day while in his bedroom, he
was surprised at the presence of a young lady dressed in white with
a wreath of flowers around her head. She told him that she was his
bride and extended her hand to him, which he took in his own and
noticed a ring on it. A few moments later, she vanished. Surprised
at this apparition and certain that he had been wide awake, he tried
to find out if anyone had come during the day. He was told that no
one had visited the house.
       A year later, he yielded to the renewed entreaties of
a relative and decided to go see the lady who had been
recommended to him. He arrived on the day of Corpus Christi.
Everybody was returning from the procession and one of the
first people he saw upon entering the house was a young lady
whom he recognized as the one who had appeared to him
earlier. She was dressed in the same clothing because the day
of the apparition had also been on Corpus Christi. He was
astonished and the girl herself cried out in surprise and fainted.
When she recovered, she explained that she had already met this
gentleman on the same day a year earlier. They were married.
That was in 1835. At the time, no one knew about spirits and,
furthermore, both were extremely practical and possessed of
less heightened imaginations than most.
       One will probably say that both had been preoccupied
with the idea of the proposed union and that this state provoked
a hallucination; however, one must not forget that the future
husband had remained so indifferent in the matter that a whole
year passed without his going to see his future bride. Even if
we accepted the hallucination hypothesis, we would still have
to explain the similarities between the double apparitions: the
coincidence of the dress, the Day of Corpus Christi and, finally, the
fact that two individuals who had never met physically recognized


                                168

                   Bi-Corporeality and Transfiguration


each other – circumstances that could not have been produced by
the imagination.
        118. Before proceeding any further, we must respond
at once to a question that inevitably arises: how can the body
remain alive while the spirit is absent? We will respond that the
body is kept alive by its organic life, which does not depend on
the presence of the spirit – like plants, which are alive but have
no spirit. We should also add, however, that during life the spirit
is never completely detached from the body. Like certain seeing
mediums, spirits recognize the spirit of a living individual by a
luminous trail that ends at the body, a phenomenon that never
occurs if the body is dead, for then the separation is complete. It
is by this connection that the spirit is warned, wherever it may be
at the time, that it must return to the body, which it does at the
speed of light. The result is that the body can never die during the
spirit’s absence, and that upon returning, the spirit will never find
the door shut, as some romanticists have portrayed in their stories
meant to entertain people. (See The Spirits’ Book, nos. 400 ff.)

          Spirit Doubles – St. Alfonso of
         Liguori and St. Anthony of Padua
        119. Let us return to our subject. While away from the
body, the spirit of a living person can show itself just as the spirit of
someone who is deceased can, and with all the appearances of reality.
Furthermore, for reasons that we have already explained, it can acquire
momentary tangibility. It is this phenomenon, designated by the
name bi-corporeality, which has given rise to stories involving doubles;
i.e., individuals whose simultaneous presence may be confirmed in
two different places at the same time. There are two examples of this
occurring, not in popular legends, but in ecclesiastical history.


                                  169

                               Chapter VII


       St. Alfonso of Liguori was canonized before the time
normally required for having shown himself simultaneously in two
different places, which was regarded as a miracle.
       While St. Anthony of Padua was preaching on one occasion
in Spain, his father, who was in Padua, was being led to his death
after having been accused of murder. St. Anthony appeared at
that moment, proved his father’s innocence and made known the
identity of the true criminal, who was later put to death. It was
proven that at the time, St. Anthony had not left Spain.
       When we evoked St. Alfonso and questioned him about this
incident, he provided us with the following answers:
       1) Would you be willing to give us an explanation for this
phenomenon?
       “Yes. When humans have completely dematerialized
themselves through their virtue and have lifted their soul toward
God, they can appear in two places at the same time. Here is how:
the incarnate spirit, sensing the approach of sleep, can ask God
permission to go somewhere. This spirit (or soul, if you wish)
then abandons the body along with a portion of its perispirit and
leaves the coarse matter behind in a state that resembles death. I
say ‘resembles death’ because the body remains connected to the
perispirit, and the soul to matter, by a link that cannot be defined.
The perispirit then appears in the desired place. I believe that is
everything you will want to know.”
       2) But that does not give us an explanation for the visibility and
tangibility of the perispirit, does it?
       “Since it is detached from matter, and depending on how
highly evolved it is, the spirit can become tangible.”
       3) Is the sleep of the body indispensable for the spirit to be able
to appear in other places?
       “The soul can split itself whenever it feels attracted to a place
different from where the body is. The body does not have to be asleep,


                                   170

                    Bi-Corporeality and Transfiguration


although in that case it is quite rare; however, at such a time it is not
in a perfectly normal state. It is always in some degree of ecstasy.”
      The soul does not actually split itself in the literal sense of the word.
      Rather, it radiates in several directions and can thus manifest itself in
      many places without becoming fragmented, just as light can be reflected
      in several mirrors at the same time.

      4) If someone were deep in sleep while the spirit was appearing
somewhere else, what would happen if he or she were suddenly awakened?
      “That would not happen, because if someone intended to
awaken the person, his or her spirit would return to the body in
anticipation, given that the spirit would have read the thought.”
      An identical explanation has been given to us many times
by spirits of both deceased and living individuals. St. Alfonso has
explained the double presence phenomenon, but has offered no
theory concerning visibility and tangibility.

                              Vespasian
        120. Tacitus reports a similar case:
        During the months that Vespasian spent in Alexandria while
awaiting the periodic return of the summer winds and the season
in which the sea was safest, many wonders occurred that were
regarded as heaven displaying its protection and the interest of the
gods in the prince.
        These wonders increased Vespasian’s desire to visit the sacred
dwelling place of the gods in order to consult them regarding the
empire. He ordered the temple to be closed to everyone else. He
then entered it and was completely attentive to what the oracle
was about to proclaim, when he saw standing behind the oracle
a highly important Egyptian named Basilides, whom he knew to
be ill in a place several days away from Alexandria. Vespasian later


                                    171

                                            Chapter VII


asked the priests if Basilides had come to the temple that day; he
asked various pedestrians if they had seen him in the city and he
finally sent horsemen who returned to assure him that Basilides
had in fact been eighty miles away at the time. Consequently, he
no longer had any doubts that the vision was supernatural and the
name of Basilides became an oracle to him (Tacitus, Histories, bk.
IV, chaps. 81 & 82, translated by Burnouf ).
       121. The person who appears simultaneously in two
different places therefore has two bodies, only one of which is real,
while the other is merely an appearance. One could say that the
former has organic life and the latter has animic life. When the
person awakens, the two bodies reunite and the animic life re-
enters the physical body. It does not seem possible - at least, we
have no examples – but reason seems to demonstrate that when
separated, the two bodies cannot simultaneously enjoy the same
degree of active and intelligent life. Moreover, concerning what
we have just stated, we would emphasize that the real body cannot
die while the apparent body remains visible: the approach of death
would always call the spirit back to the body even if for only a
moment. This also means that the apparent body could not be
killed, since it is neither organic nor composed of flesh and bone –
it would vanish the second that anyone wanted to kill it.23

                                   Transfiguration
       122. We shall now consider the second phenomenon,
transfiguration, which entails a modification of the appearance of
a living body. Regarding it, here is a case that occurred between

                  Bi-Corporeality and Transfiguration


1858 and 1859 on the outskirts of Saint-Etienne, and whose
perfect authenticity we can guarantee.
      A young lady of about fifteen possessed the strange
faculty of being able to transfigure herself, in that at any given
moment she could take on the appearances of certain deceased
individuals. This illusion was so complete as to lead one to
believe that one was actually in the person’s presence due to the
similarity of the facial traits, expressions, voice tone and even
the specific speech patterns. This phenomenon repeated itself
hundreds of times without any interference from the girl’s will.
She often took on the appearance of her brother, who had died
a few years earlier, reproducing not only his facial features but
also his girth and height.
      A local doctor who was often present during these strange
occurrences wanted to assure himself that he was not the victim
of an illusion, so he performed the following experiment (we
gathered the information from the doctor himself, the girl’s father
and many other trustworthy and honorable eye witnesses). The
doctor decided to weigh the girl in her normal state, and then
during a transfiguration in which she took on the appearance of
her brother, who had died at age twenty and who had been much
larger and stronger than she. The doctor subsequently verified
that during transfiguration the girl’s weight nearly doubled.
      The experiment was conclusive since it was impossible to
attribute the appearance to a simple optical illusion. We will try to
explain this type of occurrence, which has always been regarded as
a miracle, but which we simply label as a phenomenon.
       123. In certain cases, transfiguration can occur as the
result of a simple muscular contraction that can cause a very
different facial expression to such a degree that the person
becomes unrecognizable. We have often observed this in a few
somnambulists; however, in this case transformation is not radical.

                                 173

                              Chapter VII


A woman may appear to be young or old, beautiful or homely, but
she will always be the same woman and her weight will neither
increase nor decrease. However, in the case of the young lady,
there was obviously something more involved. The theory of the
perispirit will send us in the right direction.
       We accept in principle that the spirit can give its perispirit any
appearance it chooses, and by modifying its molecular arrangement
it can render it visible and tangible, and, consequently, opaque; that
while separated from the body, the perispirit of a living individual
can undergo the same transformations, and that this change of
state occurs through a combining of fluids.
       Next, let us imagine the perispirit of a living person,
not separated from the body, but, instead, radiating all
around the body in such a way as to envelop it like a kind
of vapor. In this state it can undergo the same modifications
as when it is away. If it loses its transparency, the body can
seem to disappear, to become invisible and veiled as if it had
been immersed in some kind of fog. It can even change its
appearance and become luminous, depending on the will or
power of the spirit. If another spirit were to combine its own
fluids with those of the former, it could substitute itself for
the person’s appearance in such a way that his or her real body
disappears, covered by an exterior fluidic envelope, whose
appearance can vary as the spirit wills. This appears to be the
true cause of this strange phenomenon, and we must state
that transfiguration is quite rare. The difference in weight can
be explained in the same way as the change in inert objects;
that is, the intrinsic weight of the body itself does not vary,
since the amount of its matter does not increase; instead, the
body is influenced by an outside agent that can increase or
decrease its relative weight (as we explain in nos. 78 ff. above).



                                  174

                         Bi-Corporeality and Transfiguration


Therefore, the transfiguration into the form of a child would
probably decrease the weight proportionally.

                                  Invisibility
       124. We can understand that the body can take on a larger
appearance than its own, or an equal one, but how can it assume
the smaller appearance of a child, as we have just proposed? In such
a case, wouldn’t the real body supersede the limits of the apparent
one? That is why we have not said that such an occurrence has
ever been actually produced. By referring to the theory of specific
weight, we simply wanted to show that the apparent weight might
also decrease.
       As for the phenomenon per se, we will neither affirm nor
deny its possibility. However, if it is indeed possible, the fact that
we cannot explain it satisfactorily does not invalidate it. We must
not forget that we are still at the beginning of this science and
that it is still far from having said the final word concerning this
point as well as many others. Besides, the parts of the body that
would exceed the limits of the smaller one could perfectly well be
rendered invisible.
       The invisibility theory naturally highlights the preceding
explanations and those that refer to the apportation phenomenon.
(See nos. 96 ff )
      125. We might have added a brief discussion of the strange
phenomenon of agénères24, which, as extraordinary as it might
appear at first glance, is no more supernatural than any of the
others. But since we have already explained it in Revue Spirite
of February 1859, we believe it would not be worthwhile to go
into detail at this time. We would simply state that it is a variety
24
     From the Greek: a, deprived of, and géine, géinomï, to engender; that which is not
     engendered – Auth.



                                          175

of tangible apparition and a state of certain spirits who can
momentarily assume the forms of living persons so as to produce
a perfect illusion.

        Spirit Clothing; The Spontaneous
         Formation of Tangible Objects
      126. We have stated that spirits often appear dressed in
tunics, enveloped in flowing drapery or in ordinary clothes.
Flowing drapery seems to be what is generally worn in the spirit
world. However, we might ask where they find clothes that are
similar in every way to those worn in life, along with all the added
accouterments. They obviously did not take these objects with
them, since such objects remain behind with us. So where do they
obtain the clothing they wear in that other world?
      This is a highly intriguing question, but for many it is no
more than mere curiosity. Nevertheless, it raised a very important


                                177

                             Chapter VIII


issue, whose solution led us to discover a general law that may
be equally applied to our own corporeal world. Numerous facts
have complicated the subject and have exposed the insufficiency
of suggested theories.
       Up to a certain point, the existence of clothing per se would
be acceptable because we could regard it as being in some way
part of the individual; however, the same cannot be said regarding
accouterments, such as the snuffbox of the man who visited the
ill lady discussed in no. 116 above. We should note that in that
particular case we were not dealing with a deceased person but a
living one, and that when the visitor returned in person, he had
an identical snuffbox. Then where did his spirit find the one used
at the foot of the ailing woman’s bed? We could cite numerous
cases in which the spirits of both deceased and living individuals
appeared with various objects such as sticks, weapons, tobacco
pipes, lanterns, books, etc.
       We then had an idea: inert objects might have ethereal
correspondents in the invisible world, and the condensed matter that
forms various objects might contain a quintessential component
that our senses cannot detect. Although this theory was not devoid
of probability, it could not explain all the facts. There was one in
particular that appeared to frustrate all interpretations. Until then,
we had only dealt with images or appearances, and we had already
seen that the perispirit can assume the properties of matter and
render itself tangible. But this tangibility is temporary, and solid
objects can vanish like shadows. Such a phenomenon is in and
of itself quite extraordinary, but what is even more impressive is
the production of matter that remains solidified, which has been
demonstrated by numerous authenticated occurrences, notably
those involving direct writing, which we shall return to in more
detail in a special chapter. However, since these phenomena are
intimately connected to our present subject and represent one of


                                 178

                  The Laboratory of the Invisible World


its more positive manifestations, we shall anticipate the order by
making a few preliminary remarks at this time.
       127. Direct writing or pneumatography is writing that is
produced spontaneously without the medium using his or her
hand or a pencil. All that is needed is a clean sheet of paper, which
can be prepared taking all necessary precautions in order to prevent
any kind of fraud. The paper is folded and placed somewhere –
in a drawer or simply on a piece of furniture. Under the proper
conditions, within a certain amount of time letters or various
marks, words, sentences and even entire communications will
appear on the paper, usually in some dark substance resembling
graphite but sometimes as though written with a red pencil,
ordinary ink or even printer’s ink.
       Such is the phenomenon in its simplest form, and whose
reproduction, although not very common, is not that rare either,
for there are mediums that can induce it very easily. When a pencil
is placed together with the paper, one might believe that the spirit
has utilized it to write with, but when only the paper is provided it
is obvious that the writing has been produced by matter put there
by the spirit itself. Where did the spirit obtain it? We were led to the
solution of this question by the snuffbox example mentioned earlier.
       128. St. Louis gave us the solution with the following
responses:
       1) We have cited a case involving the apparition of a living
person’s spirit, who carried a snuffbox and took pinches from it now and
then. Did it feel the same sensations that we would feel in such a case?
       “No.”
       2) The snuffbox had the same shape as the one the man habitually
used at home. What was the snuffbox that the spirit was using?
       “An appearance. It was made to look like the real object in
order to be noticed and so that the apparition would not be taken


                                  179

                                Chapter VIII


to be only a hallucination caused by the seer’s state of health. The
spirit wanted the lady to believe he was really present, and so he
took on all the appearances of reality.”
       3) You have said it was an appearance, but an appearance is not
actually real; it is like an optical illusion. We would like to know if the
snuffbox was an unreal image or if there was something material about it.
       “Of course there was. It is with the help of this material
principle that a perispirit can appear dressed in clothes similar to
those that it wore while alive.”
       Obviously, we must understand the word appearance to mean aspect,
       imitation. The spirit was not carrying the real snuffbox; it was only a
       representation of it. Hence, it was an appearance when compared with
       the original, although composed of a material substance.

       Experience has taught us that we must not always take the
expressions used by spirits as being literal. If we interpret them
according to our own ideas, we expose ourselves to big mistakes.
That is why we must get to the bottom of the meaning of their
words whenever they present the least ambiguity. The Spirits
themselves constantly make this very recommendation. Without
the above explanation, the word appearance, which is always used
in similar cases, could be wrongly interpreted.
       4) Could inert matter be reproduced? Could the invisible world
contain an essential matter that assumes the forms of the objects we see
in this world? In other words, could the objects in this world have their
etheric double in the invisible world in the same way that humans are
represented there by spirits?
       “Such is not the case. A spirit exerts a power over the material
elements scattered throughout the space of your atmosphere, a
power that you are far from having any inkling about. A spirit
can concentrate these elements by using its will and give them the
appearance that matches its intentions.”

                    The Laboratory of the Invisible World


       One may notice that this question was the translation of our thought
       involving the idea that we had already formed concerning the nature
       of spirit-produced objects. If the answer had been a reflection of our
       own thought, as some have suggested, we would have received the
       confirmation of our theory instead of a contrary one.

        5) I would once more categorically state the question in order to
avoid any misunderstanding: are the clothes worn by spirits something real?
        “It seems to me that the preceding answer has resolved
the question. Don’t you already understand that the perispirit is
something real?”
        6) Your explanation indicates that spirits submit ethereal matter
to the transformations they desire; thus, for example, in the case of the
snuffbox the spirit did not find it already made, but it itself produced
it when needed by an act of its will, and then un-made it in the same
way. Is this the same procedure for all other objects such as clothing,
jewelry, etc.?
        “But that is obvious.”
        7) The snuffbox was made so visible to the lady that it produced the
illusion of a real object. Could the spirit have also made it tangible to her?
        “It could have.”
        8) If so, could she have held it, believing it to be a real snuffbox?
        “Yes.”
        9) If she had opened it, would she have found snuff? If she had
inhaled some, might it have made her sneeze?
        “Yes.”

The Modification of the Properties of Matter
       10) Then, a spirit doesn’t merely form an object, but can endow
it with its own particular properties?
       “If it wants to. It was due to that principle that I responded
in the affirmative to the previous questions. You will receive proofs


                                     181

                                Chapter VIII


of the powerful actions that a spirit exerts over matter, and which
you are far from imagining – as I have already stated.”
        11) Let us suppose that a spirit wanted to make a noxious
substance, which a person then swallowed. Would he or she be poisoned?
        “A spirit could do that, but wouldn’t because it would not
be allowed to.”
        12) Could a spirit produce a wholesome substance that could
cure an illness, and has such a thing ever happened?
        “Yes, many times.”
        13) In the same way, could it make a nutritious substance? Let
us suppose that it made a piece of fruit or something; could someone
eat it and feel satiated?
        “Yes, yes; however, do not try so hard to figure out what
is so very easy to comprehend. It only takes a ray of sunlight
to enable your coarse organs to perceive the physical particles
filling the air in the midst of which you live. Don’t you realize
that air contains water vapor? Condense it out and it will return
to the liquid state. Deprive those impalpable and invisible water
molecules of heat and you will see them transformed into a very
solid object. Thus, chemists will form many other substances into
other extraordinary, even more astonishing substances. Spirits
simply possess instruments more perfect than yours: the will and
permission of God.”
      The above question on satiety is very important in this matter. How can
      a substance whose existence and properties are merely temporary and
      somehow conventional produce satiety? When it reaches the stomach,
      the substance produces the feeling of satiety, but not the satiety that
      would normally result from fullness. If such a substance can act on the
      organic economy and modify a morbid state, it can also act upon the
      stomach and cause a feeling of satiety. But we would ask pharmacists
      and restaurant owners not to be jealous or think that spirits have arrived
      to compete with them. These cases are rare and exceptional, and never


                                     182

                   The Laboratory of the Invisible World


      depend on some individual’s own will; otherwise, everyone would be fed
      and healed too cheaply.

       14) Can the objects that have been rendered tangible by a spirit’s
will remain in such a state and be used?
       “That could happen, but it is never done, for it is outside
ordinary laws.”
       15) Do all spirits possess the same degree of power for producing
tangible objects?
       “It is obvious that the more evolved a spirit is the more easily
it does so, but it also depends on the circumstances; less evolved
spirits can possess such power.”
       16) Is a spirit always aware of the way in which it produces its
clothes or the objects it renders visible?
       “No. It is often aided in their formation by an instinctive
action, which it itself does not comprehend if it is not sufficiently
enlightened.”
       17) If a spirit can draw from the universal element the
matter for such objects and give them a temporary reality with
their own particular properties, can it also draw the matter needed
to write with, which would give us the key to the phenomenon of
direct writing?
       “Finally, you have arrived at the correct point!”
      In fact, this is exactly where we wanted to arrive at with all the previous
      questions, which proves that this Spirit had read our thoughts.

        18) If the matter used by a spirit has no permanence, why don’t
letters produced by direct writing disappear?
        “Don’t draw conclusions from words. To start with, I did
not use the world never, because I was referring to a voluminous
material object. In the case of direct writings, however, these are
signs that are useful to preserve – and so they are. What I meant to
say was that the objects thus composed by a spirit cannot be made


                                     183

                              Chapter VIII


useful, since in reality they cannot possess the same aggregation of
matter as your solid objects.”
       129. The above explanation may be summarized as follows:
the spirit acts upon matter; it draws from the universal cosmic
matter, as it pleases, the elements required to form objects with the
appearance of various objects of the earth. It can also act through its
will upon the elementary matter to cause an inner transformation
that gives it certain properties. This faculty is inherent to the nature
of the spirit, who often employs it instinctively when necessary
and, therefore, without realizing it. The objects thus formed by
the spirit are temporary, depending on its will or need – it can
make them or un-make them at its own pleasure. The objects can,
in certain cases, appear perfectly real to living persons, becoming
momentarily visible and even tangible. This procedure must be
regarded as one of formation and not creation, since the spirit
cannot produce something out of nothing.
       130. The existence of a unique elementary matter is today
almost universally accepted by science and confirmed by the Spirits,
as we have just seen. This matter gives origin to all the bodies of
nature, and by the transformations it undergoes, it also produces
their various properties. That is how a healthful substance can
be made noxious by a simple modification. Chemistry itself has
provided numerous such examples.
       Everyone knows that two harmless substances can be
combined in certain portions to result in something harmful. One
part oxygen and two parts hydrogen, both harmless by themselves,
form water, but by adding only one more atom of oxygen we
have a corrosive liquid. Even without altering the proportions it
is often that a simple modification in the form of the molecular
aggregation is enough to change the properties, which is how an
opaque object can become transparent and vice-versa.


                                  184

                  The Laboratory of the Invisible World


      Since a spirit can act so decisively upon the elementary
matter by merely exerting its will, we can understand that not
only can it form various substances but it can even denature their
properties by using its own will as a reactive agent.

              Curative Magnetic Action
       131. This theory provides us with the solution to a problem
in magnetism that has been well known but inexplicable until
now – the phenomenon of the modification of the properties of
water by willpower. The acting agent is the magnetizer’s spirit,
who, in most cases, is assisted by a discarnate spirit. It causes a
transmutation by means of the magnetic fluid, which, as we have
already stated, is the substance most nearly like cosmic matter or
the universal element. And if it can thereby cause a modification
in the properties of water, it can just as easily cause a modification
in the organic fluids, which will result in the healing effect of the
magnetic action when properly directed.
       We know the crucial role played by the will in all magnetic
phenomena, but how may we explain the material action of such
a subtle agent? The will per se is not an entity, a substance or even
a property of highly etherealized matter; rather, it is the essential
attribute of the spirit; i.e., of the thinking being. With the aid
of this lever, the spirit acts upon the elementary matter, and by
a consequent action it reacts upon its components, whose inner
properties can thus be transformed.
       The will is an attribute of both the incarnate and the errant
spirit, and hence the power of the magnetizer, which we know
results from the force of his or her will. The incarnate spirit can
act upon the elementary matter and thereby modify the properties
of things within certain limits. This explains the ability to heal
by contact and the laying-on of hands, a faculty which some


                                  185

                          Chapter VIII


individuals possess to a high or low degree. (See the chapter on
Mediums, the paragraph referring to healing mediums. Also see

                 Haunted Places
       132. The spontaneous manifestations, which have occurred
down through time, and the persistence of certain spirits in making
their presence ostensibly felt in certain places, have given origin to
the belief in haunted places. The following responses were given to
questions about them:
       1) Do spirits attach themselves to individuals only or to things also?
       “It depends on how evolved they are. Certain spirits may
attach themselves to earthly objects. For example, misers who have
hidden their money and who are not sufficiently dematerialized
may continue to watch over it and guard it.”
       2) Do errant spirits show a predilection for certain places?
       “It is the same principle. Spirits who are not attached to earth
prefer places where they can practice loving deeds; these spirits are
more attracted to people than to material objects. Nevertheless,
there are those who might prefer certain places for a while, but
they are always less evolved spirits.”
       3) Since a spirit’s attachment to a place is a sign of impurity,
does it also mean that it is evil?
       “Of course not. A spirit can be little-advanced without being
evil. Doesn’t the same occur among individuals?”


                                    187

                               Chapter IX


       4) Is there any factual basis for the belief that spirits prefer to
frequent ruins?
       “No. Spirits go to those places as well as anywhere else,
but people’s imaginations are impressed by the lugubrious aspect
of certain places and attribute to their presence what is only, in
most cases, a very natural effect. How often does fear turn a tree’s
shadow into a ghost, the growl of an animal or the whistling of the
wind into a spirit? Spirits enjoy the human presence and that is
why they prefer inhabited places to abandoned ones.”
       – Nonetheless, by what we know about the diversity of
temperaments among spirits, there must be misanthropes who may
prefer solitude.
       “That is why I did not give you a definite answer to your
question. I stated that they can go to abandoned places as well as
anywhere else, so it is obvious that those who avoid human contact
do so because it suits them. This does not mean, however, that ruins
are necessarily preferred by spirits, since it is certain that they are
more often found in cities and in palaces than deep in the woods.”
       5) Popular beliefs are usually based on truth. What is the origin
of the belief in haunted places?
       “The basis of truth in this case is indeed the manifestation
of spirits, which humans have instinctively believed in throughout
time, but as I said, the notion of lugubrious places strikes
the imagination and naturally fills it with beings regarded as
supernatural. This superstitious belief is re-enforced by the works
of poets and children’s tales.”
       6) Do spirits who gather together prefer certain days and hours?
       “No. Days and hours are used by humans to control time
during their material life, but spirits do not have that need and do
not care about it.”
       7) What is the origin of the idea that spirits prefer to appear at
nighttime?


                                   188

                             Haunted Places


       “The impression made on people’s imaginations by darkness
and silence. All such beliefs are superstitions that the rational
knowledge of Spiritism must abolish. The same applies to the belief
in propitious days and hours. You must realize that the influence
of midnight has never existed except in fables.”
       – If that is so, then why do certain spirits announce that they
will arrive and manifest themselves at midnight and on particular
days, such as Friday, for example?
       “They are spirits who take advantage of human credulity for
the fun of it. It is the same reason that some say they are the Devil
or give themselves other devilish names. Show them that you are
not that stupid and they will not return.”
       8) Do spirits have any preference for visiting the graves in which
their bodies lie?
       “The body was no more than a garment. They have no
more preference for the envelope in which they had to suffer than
a prisoner for his chains. Being remembered by persons dear to
them is the only thing they value.”
       – Are prayers that are offered over their graves more pleasing to
them and do they attract them more than prayers offered elsewhere?
       “As you know, prayer is an evocation that attracts spirits. The
more fervent and sincere a prayer is, the more effect it will have.
Thus, beside the grave of some venerated person people concentrate
harder, and the preservation of pious relics is a witness to the
affection given to the spirit and to which it is always sensitive. It is
always the thought that acts upon a spirit – not material objects.
Such objects have more influence upon the one who prays by fixing
the attention upon them rather than upon the spirit.”
       9) Then the belief in haunted places would not appear to be
completely erroneous, correct?
       “We have stated that certain spirits may be attracted to
material things and can therefore be attracted to certain places in


                                  189

                                           Chapter IX


which they appear to take up residence until the circumstances
that have drawn them there no longer exist.”
      – What circumstances could so draw them?
      “Their affinity for some of the people who frequent such
places or the desire to communicate with them; however, their
intentions are not always so praiseworthy. When evil spirits are
involved, they may seek revenge against certain individuals
with whom they have some complaint. Having to remain in a
determined place may also be for some a punishment that has
been imposed, especially if they have committed a crime there, of
which they will constantly be reminded.”25
      10) Are such places always haunted by their former residents?
      “Sometimes, but not always. If the former resident was an
advanced spirit, it would have no more connection to its former
abode than to its body. The spirits who haunt certain places nearly
always do so out of caprice, at least those who may be attracted out
of sympathy for certain persons.”
      – Might they affix themselves to a place in order to protect a
person or family?
      “Assuredly, if they are good spirits. But in that case they
never make their presence known disagreeably.”
      11) Is there any truth to the story of the White Lady?
      “It is a fable derived from a thousand real incidents.”
      12) Is it rational to be afraid of places that are haunted by spirits?
      “No. The spirits who haunt certain places and make
disturbances are mostly trying to entertain themselves at the
expense of the gullible and cowardly, rather than doing evil.
Remember that spirits are everywhere and that wherever you
are there are spirits right beside you – even in the most peaceful
houses. They only seem to haunt certain residences because they
find the opportunity to manifest their presence in them.

                            Haunted Places


       13) Is there a way to get rid of them?
       “Yes, but nearly always what is done only serves to attract
them instead. The best way to expel evil spirits is to attract good
ones. Therefore, attract good spirits by doing as much good as
possible. Then, the evil ones will flee, since good and evil are
incompatible. Always be good and you will only have good spirits
at your side.”
       – But there are very good individuals who are nonetheless
confronted with petty annoyances by evil spirits.
       “If they are really good, it could be a test to exercise their
patience and incite them to be better still. But don’t believe that
all those who always speak of virtue actually possess it themselves.
Those who possess true moral qualities are nearly always unaware
of them or do not talk about them.”
       14) Is exorcism an effective means of expelling evil spirits from
haunted places?
       “Have you ever seen an effective exorcism? No, you haven’t;
on the contrary, haven’t the troubles doubled after exorcism rites?
That is because such spirits love being taken for the Devil. Spirits
who have no evil intentions can also manifest their presence by
making noises or even by making themselves visible, but they never
do so to cause trouble. They are quite often suffering spirits, for
whom you can provide relief by praying for them. At other times,
they are benevolent spirits, who wish to show that they are with
you, or, finally, they may be frivolous spirits who are entertaining
themselves. Since those who disturb the peace with noises are
nearly always spirits who are amusing themselves, it is best simply
to laugh at their antics. They will depart when they see that they
can neither frighten nor vex you.” (See chap. V: Spontaneous
Physical Manifestations).
       The result of the above explanations is that there are spirits
who attach themselves to certain places and prefer to remain there,


                                  191

                             Chapter IX


but they do not have to manifest their presence by perceivable
effects. Any place at all may be the obligatory or preferred dwelling
of a spirit, even if it is an evil one, without ever having produced
any kind of manifestation.
       Spirits who connect themselves to places or material things
are never highly evolved, but just because they are not evolved it
does not mean they are evil or fed by evil intentions. At times, they
are even companions who are more useful than harmful, for if they
take an interest in certain persons, they may protect them.

             Communications

     Serious Communications • Instructive Communications



        133. We have stated that every effect revealing the act of a
free will as its cause, and no matter how insignificant it may be,
proves that such a cause is in fact an intelligent one. Thus, the simple
movement of a table which has responded to our thought, or which
displays an intentional character, may be regarded as an intelligent
manifestation. If table-moving were all that happened, we would not
be nearly as interested in the matter. However, we have received proof
that there is more than simple physical action in these phenomena.
Any practical usefulness that we could derive from them would be
zero or at least very limited; however, everything changes when this
intelligence reaches a point where a regular and continuous exchange
of ideas may ensue. At such point, they can no longer be treated
as simple intelligent manifestations but as true communications. The
means at our disposal nowadays that enable us to receive them are as
extensive, explicit and rapid as those we have with one another.

                             Chapter X


       If we have fully understood the infinite variety of spirits
as to their intelligence and morality according to the Spirit
Hierarchy (The Spirits’ Book, no. 100), we will easily comprehend
the differences in their communications. Their communications
must necessarily reflect the nobility or baseness of their ideas,
their wisdom or ignorance, and their vices or virtues. In other
words, their communications no more resemble one another than
the communications of people of illiterate and more educated
cultures among humans. The different types of communications
can be classified into four main categories. According to their
predominant characteristics they may be crude, frivolous, serious
or instructive.

               Crude Communications
        134. Crude communications are those containing expressions
that shock decorum. They can only come from spirits of the
lowest orders, who are still soiled by all the impurities of matter,
and there is nothing different about them than the expressions
used by depraved and crude human beings. Any person with a
minimum amount of sensitivity is repulsed by them, for they are
trivial, ignoble, obscene, insolent, arrogant, malevolent and even
impious, depending on the character of the spirit.

             Frivolous Communications
      135. Frivolous communications are those from frivolous,
mocking or mischievous spirits, who are more cunning than
downright evil and who give no importance to anything they say.
Since these communications have nothing improper about them,
they please certain individuals who find them entertaining and
who find satisfaction in useless conversations in which much is

                                194

                    The Nature of Communications


talked about but nothing is actually said. These spirits sometimes
let loose with witty and biting tirades, often mixing banal jokes
with hard truths that nearly always hit with great accuracy.
Frivolous spirits are the ones who swarm around us and use every
opportunity to meddle in our spirit communications. Truth
concerns them very little, and thus they feel a malicious pleasure
in befuddling those who are weak and predisposed enough to
believe their words. People who like this sort of communication
naturally open themselves up to frivolous and deceiving spirits.
Serious spirits stay away from them, as among us serious men and
women stay away from groups of irresponsible people.

               Serious Communications
       136. Serious communications are serious both as to subject
and form. Every communication which does not display any
frivolousness or crudeness, and which has a useful purpose,
even though perhaps of private interest only, is naturally serious.
However, that does not mean that such communications are always
without error, since serious spirits are not all equally enlightened.
They are ignorant of many things and they may be mistaken about
them, though in good faith. That is why truly high order spirits
constantly recommend that we submit all communications to the
control of reason and the strictest logic.
       Hence, we must distinguish between communications that
are truely serious and those that are erroneously serious, which is not
always easy, for due to the seriousness of their language, certain
presumptuous or pseudo-scholar spirits may attempt to impose
the most wrong-headed ideas and the most absurd theories. In
addition, to render them more acceptable and lend them more
importance, they have no scruples about adorning themselves with
the most respectable and even the most venerated names.

       This is one of the biggest obstacles faced by practical
Spiritism. We shall return to deal with this subject further on,
giving it the development required by its importance, and at the
same time we shall shed light on the means of avoiding the danger
of erroneous communications.

            Instructive Communications
       137. Instructive communications are serious communications
whose main purpose is to provide teaching given by spirits
about the sciences, morality, philosophy, etc. Their greater or
lesser profoundness depends on the particular spirit’s degree of
advancement and dematerialization. In order to take full advantage
of such communications, they must be regular and followed with
perseverance. Serious spirits connect themselves to those who desire
to be taught and they assist them, whereas they leave frivolous
spirits the job of entertaining those who only see communications
as being a type of temporary distraction.
       It is only through the regularity and frequency of these
communications that we can appraise the moral and intellectual
value of the spirits who are communicating with us, as well as the
degree of trust they deserve. If we require experience in order to
judge other people, we need it even more to judge spirits.
       If we deem such communications to be instructive, we therefore
suppose them to be true, for something that is not true cannot be
instructive even if transmitted in the most striking language. Thus,
in this category we cannot include teachings that often display a
striking and pompous style, since they come from spirits who are more
pretentious than wise and who wish to deceive us. However, such spirits
cannot disguise their shallowness or keep up their charade for very
long. They soon expose their weak side by showing little continuity in
their communications, or by our challenging of their statements.


                                 196

                    The Nature of Communications


       138. The means of communication vary widely. By acting
upon our physical organs and senses, spirits can express themselves
through sight – apparitions; touch – concealed or visible tangible
impressions; hearing – noises; smell – odors whose cause is
unknown. Although it is very real, this last means of manifestation
is undoubtedly the least dependable due to the numerous causes
that can lead to error, and thus we will not take any time for it at
present. What we must carefully examine are the diverse means of
receiving communications; i.e., a regular and continuous exchange
of ideas. The means for doing so are raps, speech and writing. We
shall pursue our study of them in special chapters.




                                197


                           CHAPTER XI

 Sematology and Typtology
  • The Language of Signals and Raps; Alphabetical Typtology



       139. The earliest intelligent manifestations were expressed
by means of raps or typtology. This primitive method, restricted
by the initial conditions of the process, offered only very little
usefulness. Consequently, communications received in this manner
were at first limited to monosyllabic yes/no responses through a
predetermined number of raps. As we have stated, however, the
method was later improved upon. Raps are produced by two
procedures through special mediums, and in order for this method
to work an aptitude for physical manifestations is usually required.
The first procedure, which may be called seesaw typtology, consists
in the movement of a table which rises to one side and then drops
to strike with the formerly upraised leg. All that is required of the
mediums in this case is for them to rest their hands on the edge
of the table. If they want to converse with a particular spirit, an
evocation is required; if not, the first spirit to arrive or the one
who habitually comes manifests itself. For example, having agreed
that one strike means yes and two means no (the number does not
matter), questions are then asked of the spirit (later, we will see


                                199

                              Chapter XI


which questions we should refrain from asking). The problem is
the briefness of the answers and the difficulty in formulating the
question so that the answer can be either yes or no. Suppose we
want to ask the spirit, “What do you want?” It can only respond
with one word. So we would have to ask, “Do you want this?”
“No.” That?” “Yes.” And so on.
        140. It is interesting to note that in employing this method,
the spirit normally adds a sort of mimicry; i.e., it expresses how
emphatic the affirmation or negation is through the force of the
strikes. It may also express the nature of the sentiments that prompt
it: violence by rough movements, or anger and impatience by
strong repeated raps – like someone tamping his or her foot with
anger – to the point of even smashing the table leg to the floor.
However, if it is a kind and gentle spirit, at the end of the session
it will incline the table as if waving goodbye. If the spirit wants to
address one of the participants directly, it will raise the table toward
him or her either smoothly or violently, depending on whether it
wants to display affection or hostility. Properly speaking, this is
semiotics or sign language, as typtology is the language of raps. Here
is a notable example of the spontaneous use of semiotics: we knew
of a gentleman who was in his living room one day, where several
persons were involved in spirit manifestations, when he received
one of our letters. While he was reading it, the small table that
was being used for the experiments suddenly moved toward him.
When he had finished reading the letter, he went to place it on
a table at the other end of the room. The small table followed
him and directed itself toward where he had deposited the letter.
Surprised at the coincidence, he thought there might be some
relation between the movement and the letter, so he asked the
spirit, who responded that it was one of our [Kardec’s] familiar
spirits. When the gentleman informed us of what had happened,
we asked the spirit about its reason for the visit that it had made.

                                  200

                       Sematology and Typtology


It responded, “It is natural that I visit the persons with whom you
maintain relations so that I can provide you and them both, if
necessary, any needed advice.”
       It is obvious that the spirit wanted to call the man’s attention
to the fact that it was there and it had sought an opportunity to do
so. A mute person could not have done any better.
       141. It did not take long for typtology to be improved upon
and to be enriched with a more complete form of communication,
i.e., alphabetical typtology, which consists in the indication of
letters by means of raps. It was then possible to receive words,
sentences and even entire discourses. Depending on the method
employed, the table strikes as many raps as necessary to indicate
each letter, that is, one strike for a, two for b and so on while
someone records the letters indicated. The spirit indicates when
the process is finished by means of a predetermined signal.
       It is easy to see that this procedure is very slow and requires
quite some time for the longest communications. Nevertheless, there
were persons who were patient enough to use it in order to obtain
several pages. This practice, however, led to the discovery of shortcuts
that allowed the work to proceed faster. The one most commonly
employed consists in having in front of the mediums the alphabet
and a series of numbers indicating units. While one medium is at
the table, another points to the letters if they want to obtain words,
or to the numbers if they want a number. When the second person
reaches the letter needed, the table strikes a rap and the experimenter
writes the letter. This procedure is repeated for the second, third and
following letters. If there is a mistake, the spirit warns the mediums
by making the table strike or move and they then start over. This
procedure becomes quite rapid with practice. By guessing the
word which has just started to form, according to the context, the
communication procedure can be shortened. If there is any doubt,
the spirit is consulted, who then responds by yes or no.

                                  201

                              Chapter XI


       142. All these effects may be obtained even more simply
through raps occurring within the wood of the table itself without
any movement at all (in conformance with what we reported in
the chapter on physical manifestations – no. 64); this is known as
internal typtology. Not all mediums are equally skilled at this latter
form of communication and some can only receive tilting table
raps. However, with practice most can manage it and this method
has the double advantage of being faster, lending itself less to
someone suspecting that the tilting can be attributed to voluntary
pressure applied by the medium. It is true that internal raps can
also be imitated by deceitful mediums – the best things are subject
to imitation – but this proves nothing against their reality. (See the
chapter toward the end of this volume entitled Fraud and Trickery)
       Whatever improvements may be introduced into this
method, it can never attain the speed and ease that writing presents,
which is why it is little used nowadays. Nonetheless, it is sometimes
of interest because of its phenomenological aspect, particularly
for newcomers, since it has the special advantage of peremptorily
proving absolute independence from the medium’s own thoughts.
With this method we often receive responses that are so unexpected
and surprising that one would have to be very prejudiced indeed
to deny the evidence. Thus, it has been a powerful motive of
conviction for many individuals. However, when this method is
employed – even more than when others are employed – spirits do
not like to be submitted to the caprice of the curious who want to
put them to the test with questions off the subject.
       143. In order to better safeguard the independence of
communications from the medium’s own thoughts, several
instruments have been invented, such as dial plates on which
letters like those used in electric telegraphs have been engraved. A
needle, which moves under the medium’s influence and with the
help of a conducting wire and pulley, indicates the letters.

                                 202

                      Sematology and Typtology


      We have only become familiar with such instruments through
designs and descriptions published in America; thus, we cannot
determine their true worth but it seems that their complexity
would be quite inconvenient. We believe that independence from
the medium is perfectly proven by internal raps – even more so
by the unexpectedness of the answers – than by all other material
means. Moreover, disbelievers, who are always predisposed to
seeing pieces of string and set-ups, will be even more inclined to
distrust some sort of special mechanism than a plain table devoid
of any kind of accouterments.
       144. A simpler device, but one that bad faith can easily
abuse (as we will see in the chapter on fraud) is what we will
designate by the name Girardin Table, in memory of the use
made of it by Madame Emile de Girardin during the many
communications she received as a medium. Although she was
very bright, Madame Girardin had the weakness of believing in
spirits and their manifestations! The device consists of a small
round table top about 18 inches in diameter that can turn freely
and easily around an axle like a wheel. Letters, numbers and the
words yes and no are engraved on its surface around the edge,
and in the center is a fixed pointer. The medium puts his or her
fingers on the edge of the top, which spins until it stops with
the desired letter in line with the pointer. The letters are written
down, quickly forming words and sentences.
       One should note that the round table top does not slide
around under the medium’s fingers; instead, they remain fixed
in one place on the edge and follow the movement. A powerful
medium could possibly manage to produce an independent
movement. We believe that it is possible but we have never
witnessed it. If the experiment could be performed in this
way, it would be more conclusive because it would be less
open to fraud.

                              Chapter XI


       145. We must correct a widespread error that consists in
confusing all spirits who communicate through raps with those who
are specifically known as ‘rapping spirits’. Typtology is a means of
communication like any other and is just as worthy of being used by
high order spirits as is writing and speech. All spirits, whether good
or evil, can use it as well as the other means. What characterizes
highly evolved spirits is the loftiness of their thought and not the
instrument that they use to transmit it. They undoubtedly prefer
the most convenient and rapid means, but when there is no pencil
or paper available, they have no qualms about using a plain talking
table. This is demonstrated by the fact that we have received
communications in this way that are most sublime. If we no longer
use the table, it is not because we despise it, but rather because as
a phenomenon it has already taught us everything we needed to
know and can no longer add to our convictions. Additionally, the
length of the communications that we now receive requires a speed
that is incompatible with typtology.
       Hence, all the spirits that communicate through raps are not
rapping spirits – a designation that should be reserved for those
whom we may call ‘professional’ rappers, who use this means either
to entertain people, or else to vex others with their troublemaking,
sometimes with witty exchanges, but never profound ones. It would
therefore be a waste of time to ask them any questions of a certain
scientific or philosophical interest. Because of their ignorance and
inferiority, other spirits have justifiably characterized them as the
jesters and clowns of the spirit world. Nonetheless, we must add
that they do not always act on their own count but often serve as
the instruments of highly evolved spirits who may want to produce
material effects.

 Pneumatography or Direct
  Writing Pneumatophony
                       Direct Writing
       146. Pneumatography is writing produced directly by a spirit
without any intermediary. It differs from psychography, which is
the transmission of a spirit’s thought in writing through the hand
of a medium.
       The direct writing phenomenon is unarguably one of the
most extraordinary in Spiritism, but as strange as it may at first
appear to be, today it is a proven and incontestable fact. If a theory
is needed in order to comprehend the possibility of Spiritist
phenomena in general, this case especially requires one since it is
one of the most startling presented so far. Nonetheless, it ceases to
seem supernatural when the principle underlying it is understood.
       When this phenomenon first appeared, the dominant feeling
about it was one of distrust. Fraud was quickly suspected because
everyone in fact knows about so-called invisible inks, whose marks
are invisible at first but become visible sometime after the writing.
Hence, it seemed like it was a possible abuse of people’s credulity,

                                 205

                                     Chapter XII


and we cannot say that such has never occurred. We are even
convinced that whether out of a mercenary interest or plain vanity,
or to elicit belief in their powers, some individuals have employed
such subterfuges. (See the chapter on Fraud)
       Just because something can possibly be imitated, however,
it is absurd to conclude that it therefore does not exist. Haven’t
the means of imitating somnambulistic lucidity to the point of
causing illusion been recently discovered? And just because this
deceitful method has been used in all the carnivals, must we
therefore conclude that there are no true somnambulists? Just
because some retailers sell adulterated wine can we say that there
is no such thing as pure wine? The same applies to direct writing;
however, the precautions that were taken to assure the reality of the
phenomenon were very simple and easy, and thanks to these, there
can no longer be any doubt about the phenomenon nowadays.
       147. Since the possibility of writing without an intermediary
is an attribute of spirits, who have always existed and in every era
have produced the various phenomena with which we are familiar,
they surely must have produced direct writing during antiquity as
well as today. This could explain the appearance of the four words
written on Belshazzar’s26 party hall wall. During the Middle Ages –
so steeped in secretive wonders, which the stake tried to hush up –
direct writing must also have been known about. Perhaps, in the
theory regarding the modifications that spirits can produce in
matter (and which we developed in chap. VIII), the principle for
the medieval belief in the transmutation of metals may be found.
       Whatever the results obtained in previous eras may have
been, however, it was only after the popularization of spirit
manifestations that the issue of direct writing began to be taken
seriously. The first time it became known in Paris a few years ago

                                The Development of Mediums


seems to have been when Baron Guldenstubbe published a very
interesting work on the subject employing a large number of
facsimiles that had been written in this manner.27 The phenomenon
had already been known about in America for quite some time.
Guldenstubbe’s social position, his independence and the respect
he enjoyed in high society undeniably discounted any suspected
voluntary fraud because he had no ulterior motive to encourage
him. At most, what could be accepted was that he had been the
victim of illusion himself. However, a decisive fact was presented
against such a notion: the same phenomenon was witnessed by
other persons, who had taken all the necessary precautions for
avoiding any fraud or cause for error.
       148. As with most of the non-spontaneous spirit manifestations,
direct writing is received through meditation, prayer and evocation.
Many times it has been obtained in churches, on tombs and at the foot
of statues and images of the personages so evoked. Yet, it is obvious
that the location serves only to influence meditation and engender
greater mental concentration, since it has been shown to be equally
obtainable without such accessories and in the most ordinary places
such as upon simple domestic furniture, whenever the required moral
conditions exist and if the necessary mediumistic faculty is available.
       At first, it was found that it was necessary to place a pencil
and paper together; thus, the phenomenon could be more easily
explained. Since we know that spirits can move and dislocate
objects and that they can sometimes pick them up and throw
them about, then they could easily pick up a pencil and write
with it. Since they can also write by using the medium’s hand
or planchette28 as an intermediary, then they can surely write
directly. Consequently, it was soon discovered that the pencil was

unnecessary, that it was enough to supply a sheet of paper, folded
or not, and that in a few minutes, letters would begin to appear.
Here, the phenomenon completely changed its character and we
were introduced to another order of ideas. The letters were written
with some kind of substance, and since we were not the ones who
furnished it, the spirit itself had to have produced and brought it.
But from where? That was the question.
        If we refer back to chap. VIII, nos. 127 and 128, we will
find a complete explanation for this phenomenon. In this type
of writing, a spirit does not use our substances or instruments. It
itself produces what it needs by drawing matter from the universal
primitive element, which, under the influence of the spirit’s will,
undergoes the necessary modifications to attain the desired effect.
In this way it can produce the writing of a red pencil, typographical
printer’s ink or ordinary ink, like black ink, or even typographical
characters that are sufficiently firm to leave an indentation in the
paper, as we have had the opportunity to witness. The daughter of
one of our acquaintances, a girl of 12 or 13 years, received pages
written in something resembling pastel colors.
       149. Such was the result that led us to the phenomenon of
the snuffbox in chap. VII, no. 116 - a matter we discussed at great
length because it seemed to be an opportunity to probe into one of
the most important laws of Spiritism, a law whose understanding
could clarify many mysteries surrounding the invisible world. It
is thus that the light can be derived from an apparently ordinary
incident; we only need to observe closely, something we and
everyone else can do when we do not limit ourselves to watching
effects without looking for their underlying causes. If our faith
becomes stronger day by day, it is because we understand. Make
sure you understand if you want to win serious adherents. The
understanding of matters has a further result in that it establishes
a dividing line between truth and superstition.

                                208

                    The Development of Mediums


       If we take into consideration the advantages that direct
writing can offer, we will admit that until now its main usefulness
has consisted in the material proof of an important fact: the
intervention of a hidden power that can use this process as a new
means of manifesting itself. However, communications obtained
in this way are rarely very lengthy. They are generally spontaneous
and are limited to words, sentences and, quite often, unintelligible
symbols. They may occur in all languages: Greek, Latin, Syriac,
in hieroglyphs, etc., but they cannot yet lend themselves to
the continuous and rapid conversations obtained through
psychography – writing using the medium’s hand.

                     Pneumatophony
       150. Since spirits can produce noises and raps, they can
naturally make all kinds of cries and vocal sounds, including
imitating the human voice, either right at our side or in the air.
We call this phenomenon pneumatophony. According to what we
know about the nature of spirits, we can imagine that some of
those who belong to a lower order are deluded with the belief that
they can speak as they did when they were alive. (See Revue Spirite,
Feb. 1858: Histoire du revenant de mademoiselle Clarion)
       We must therefore avoid taking for occult voices all sounds
with an unknown cause behind them, or a simple ringing in the
ears, and especially accepting the popular belief that ringing ears
are warning us that someone is talking about us somewhere. These
ringings have a purely physiological cause and are meaningless,
whereas the sounds of pneumatophony express thoughts, and
we can thus recognize that there is an intelligent rather than an
accidental cause behind them. As a guiding principle, we can
establish the fact that only obviously intelligent effects can attest
to the manifestation of spirits. As for other effects, the odds are


                                209

                            Chapter XII


more than a hundred to one in favor of them being produced by
fortuitous causes.
      151. When we are half-asleep we frequently hear words,
names and sometimes entire sentences distinctly pronounced so
loudly that we awaken startled. Although some of these incidents
may really be manifestations, there is nothing so remarkable about
them that we cannot attribute them to a cause similar to what we
developed in the theory of hallucination (chap. VI, nos. 111 ff.).
Hence, what is usually heard in this state is of no consequence. The
same does not apply, however, when we are truly awake, because
then if we are actually hearing a spirit, we can usually exchange
thoughts with it and strike up a normal conversation.
      Spirit sounds or pneumatophonics manifest in two very
distinct ways: sometimes as an inner voice that resonates within
us, and although the words may be clear and distinct, they are not
physically produced; at other times, as words that are outside of us
and which are so distinctly articulated that they seem to be coming
from someone standing right beside us.
      Whichever way it is produced, the phenomenon of
pneumatophony is nearly always spontaneous and it can rarely
be evoked.

        • Indirect Psychography: Baskets and Planchettes
                • Direct or Manual Psychography



                Indirect Psychography:
                Baskets and Planchettes
       152. Spiritist science has progressed like all the other
sciences but even more rapidly. Only a few short years separate us
from the primitive and incomplete methods that we trivially called
table turning, to where we are now, communicating with spirits
as easily and quickly as ordinary persons do amongst themselves
and by the same means: speaking and writing. Writing has the
special advantage of physically demonstrating the intervention of
a concealed power by leaving traces that we can preserve in the
same way that we can preserve our own correspondence. Our first
method was to use planchettes or small baskets fitted with a pencil,
and which were prepared as follows.
      153. As we have stated, a person gifted with a special
aptitude can produce a rotational movement in a table or other


                                211

                                        Chapter XIII


object. Instead of a table, let us take a little basket of four to six
inches in diameter (it does not matter if it is wood or wicker; the
substance is not important). Now if we firmly attach a pencil to
the bottom of the basket, with the tip pointed downwards, and
keep it balanced on a sheet of paper while placing our fingers on
the edge of the basket, it will begin to move. Instead of turning,
however, the basket will guide the pencil in various directions on
the paper in order to trace meaningless symbols or letters. If a spirit
is evoked and wishes to take part, it will respond not with raps but
by writing. The movement of the basket is not automatic like that
of the turning tables; it becomes an intelligent process. Rigged in
this manner, the pencil does not return to the margin to begin
another line when it reaches the edge of the paper, but continues
to write in a circle. The writing thus forms a spiral, which requires
rotating the paper in order to read it. The writing received in this
way is not always very legible, because words are not separated,
but by using a sort of intuition the medium can easily decipher it.
For the sake of economy we can replace the paper and pencil with
a slate and slate pencil. We shall call this little basket by the name
spinning basket. The basket is sometimes replaced with a cardboard
box similar to a little pill box, with the pencil forming an axis like
in the game called teetotum.29
      154. Many other gadgets have been invented for the same
purpose. The most convenient is what we shall call the beaked
basket, which consists in fitting to the basket a wooden spindle in
an inclined position and sticking out of the basket a few inches,
resembling a ship’s bowsprit. After boring a hole in the tip of the
spindle, a pencil is placed in it, which is long enough to rest its
point on the paper. Then, the medium places his or her fingers
on the edge of the basket and the entire instrument moves with

the pencil writing as described above, except that the writing is
usually more legible with spaces between the words, and the lines
are not in a spiral but in parallel as in normal writing, because the
medium can easily return the pencil when each line is finished. We
have obtained dissertations of many pages using this method and
as rapidly as if we had hand-written them.
      155. The manifesting intelligence often reveals itself
through other unequivocal signs. For example, when coming to
the end of the page, the pencil spontaneously makes a motion
for it to be turned over; if it wants to refer to a preceding
passage on the same page or on another, it indicates it with
the pencil point – as someone would do with his or her finger
- and underlines it. If the spirit wants to direct itself toward
a particular participant, the tip of the wooden basket points
toward that person. For brevity, it often uses a special sign for
yes and no as we do by nodding or shaking our head. If it wants
to show anger or impatience, it taps repeatedly with the pencil
and often ends up breaking the point.
       156. Some persons replace the basket with a type of
specially made miniature table about five inches in length and
about two inches in height, with three legs and a pencil attached
to one; the other two are rounded or fitted with a little ivory
ball so that they can slide easily across the paper. Still others
simply use a square, triangular, oval or rectangular planchette
about five inches long with an oblique hole near one of the
edges into which a pencil is fitted. When placed on the paper
to write, it tilts and is supported on one side on the paper.
Sometimes it is fitted with two small wheels on each side to
facilitate the movement. In conclusion, we should understand
that there is nothing absolute about any of these devices. The
most convenient is the best.

                             Chapter XIII


       With whichever type of apparatus is used, there must be two
operators, but they do not both have to be mediums. One only
serves to help balance the device and reduce the medium’s fatigue.

          Direct or Manual Psychography
        157. We call writing received in the above manner indirect
psychography, as opposed to direct or manual psychography written
by mediums themselves. In order to understand the latter system
one must know how it works. The communicating spirit acts
upon the medium who, under its influence, then mechanically
moves his or her arm and hand to write, but in most cases does
not have the least awareness of what is being written; the hand acts
upon the basket, and the basket upon the pencil. Thus, the basket
itself does not become intelligent but only serves as an instrument for
an intelligence. The basket is actually nothing more than a pencil
holder, an extension of the hand and an intermediary between
hand and pencil. By simply eliminating this intermediary and
placing the pencil directly in the medium’s hand, we get the same
result with a much simpler mechanism since the medium writes
as is done under normal conditions. Therefore, any medium who
writes with the help of a basket, planchette or other device can also
write directly. Of all the means of communicating, manual writing,
which some call involuntary writing, is undoubtedly the simplest,
easiest and most convenient since it requires no preparation, and
like ordinary writing, it lends itself to more extensive dissertations.
We will return to this subject when we discuss mediums.
      158. When these manifestations first began to appear and
as no one yet had a precise understanding of them, there were
many publications containing articles such as: Communications of a
basket, of a planchette, of a table, etc.; however, today we understand


                                 214

                            Psychography


that such expressions are insufficient or erroneous, even without
having to consider their frivolous character. Actually, as we have
already seen, the tables, planchettes and baskets are not intelligent
instruments, although they are momentarily animated with
fictitious life; yet none of them can communicate by themselves.
Understanding to the contrary would be taking the effect for the
cause, or the instrument for the principle. It would be like an
author writing under the title of his or her book that it had been
written ‘by’ a metallic pen or ‘by’ a goose quill. Furthermore, such
instruments are not exclusive. We know someone who instead of
a spinning basket uses a funnel with a pencil in the neck. Hence,
communications could be received with a funnel, a saucepan or
a salad bowl. If they are received by means of raps, not with a
table but with a chair or walking-stick, then there will not be a
talking table, but a talking chair or stick. One can see that what is
important to understand is not the instrument but the manner in
which the communications are obtained. No matter what supports
the pencil, if we obtain them by writing, we call it psychography;
if by raps, we call it typtology. In taking on the proportions of an
actual science, Spiritism requires scientific language.

       159. Every individual who senses the influence of spirits
to any degree of intensity is a medium. This faculty is inherent to
humankind. It therefore does not constitute an exclusive privilege,
and there are very few individuals who do not possess it at least in
a rudimentary state. Thus, we can state that everyone is a medium
to a certain degree. Usually, however, this label is applied solely
to those who possess a well characterized mediumistic faculty
that expresses itself through patent effects of a certain intensity,
which depends on a more or less sensitive physical organization.
One should further note that this faculty does not express itself
in all mediums in the same way. Mediums usually have a special
aptitude for this or that order of phenomena, which divides them
into as many different varieties as there are kinds of manifestations.
The main varieties are: physical effects mediums, sensitive or


                                 217

                              Chapter XIV


impressionable mediums, hearing, speaking, seeing, somnambulistic,
healing, pneumatographic, writing or psychographical mediums.

               Physical Effects Mediums
        160. Physical effects mediums are particularly able to induce
physical phenomena such as movements of inert objects, noises,
etc. They may be divided into facultative mediums and involuntary
mediums. (See pt. 2, chaps. II and IV)
        Facultative mediums are aware of their ability and induce spirit
phenomena through their own will. As we have stated, although this
faculty is inherent in the human species, it is far from manifesting
itself in all mediums to the same degree. However, if there are few
individuals who do not possess it at all, there are even fewer who
can induce impressive effects, such as suspending heavy objects
in midair, moving them through the air and, especially, inducing
apparitions. The simplest effects involve the rotation of an object,
raps produced by the lifting of an object or raps produced internally
in the object’s own substance. Although we do not attribute any
major importance to these phenomena, we nevertheless do not
believe they should be slighted. They can provide interesting
observations and can contribute to strengthening one’s convictions,
but one should note that the faculty of inducing physical effects
rarely manifests among those who have more advanced means of
communication at their disposal, such as writing and speech. The
faculty usually decreases to the degree that another develops.
        161. Involuntary or natural mediums are those who exert
their influence without realizing it. They are unaware of their
ability and almost always, whatever happens around them that
appears to be abnormal does not seem so extraordinary to them
at all. These matters make up part of who they are, exactly like


                                  218

                               Mediums


persons gifted with second sight but who are unaware of it. These
individuals are worthy of observation and we should not neglect
gathering and studying the facts of this kind that may come to our
attention. They have occurred throughout history and frequently
among young children. (See chap. V: Spontaneous Manifestations)
        This faculty is not per se an indication of a pathological
state, because it is not incompatible with perfect health. If the
person who possesses it is ill, the illness is caused by something
else. Moreover, therapeutic procedures are powerless to make it
disappear. In some cases it can appear after a certain period of
organic weakness, but it is never the weakness’ efficient cause.
Therefore, there is no reason to become concerned with it as far
as one’s health is concerned. There would only be a problem if the
individual, upon becoming a facultative medium, used it in an
abusive manner, for then there could be an excessive emission of
vital fluid, which could then result in organic weakening.
        162. Reason revolts at remembering the mental and physical
tortures that science has sometimes inflicted on feeble and delicate
persons in order to assure that there was no fraud on their part. Most
of the time, such experiments performed with evil intentions are often
harmful to sensitive organisms and can cause serious disorders in the
organic economy. Performing tests such as these is to play with life
itself. A good faith researcher does not need to employ such means.
Those who are familiar with these phenomena moreover know that
they belong more to the mental than to the physical order, and that
it would be futile to try to find their solution in our exact sciences.
        Due to the fact that these phenomena belong to the mental
order, everything that could over excite the imagination of such
persons should be avoided with a no-less rigorous caution. We
know how many accidents can produce fear, and there would be less
imprudence if we knew all the cases of mental infirmity and epilepsy
that are provoked by stories of werewolves and bogeymen. So what

                                 219

                                         Chapter XIV


would happen if they could persuade someone that he or she was
dealing with the Devil? Those who seek to convince others of such
ideas do not know the responsibility they assume: they can kill! And
this danger does not exist only for the patients themselves, but also
for those around them, who might become terrified by thinking that
their house has become a den of demons. It was this disastrous belief
that produced acts of atrocity in times of ignorance. Therefore, a
little discernment would be sufficient to understand that in burning
bodies considered to be possessed by the Devil, they did not burn
the Devil. Since they desired to free themselves of the Devil, then
they should have burned him instead. By enlightening us about the
true cause of all these phenomena, the Spiritist Doctrine deals the
deathblow to this belief. Thus, far from confirming such an idea, it is
our moral and humane duty to fight it wherever it exists.
        What should be done when a faculty of this kind spontaneously
develops in an individual is to allow the phenomena to follow
their natural course: nature is wiser than human beings. Moreover,
Providence has its plans and the most humble creature may serve as
the instrument of its broadest designs. Nonetheless, we must concede
that the phenomena sometimes assume fatiguing and importune
proportions for everyone involved.30 In every case, here is what

30
     One of the most extraordinary incidents of this nature, both for the variety and strangeness
     of the phenomena, is undoubtedly one that took place in 1852 in the Palatinate (a
     province in Bavaria) of Bergzabern, close to Wissemburg. It is all the more remarkable
     since it brought together in the same individual almost all the types of spontaneous
     manifestations: loud noises that shook the house, overturned furniture; objects thrown
     about by an invisible hand; visions and apparitions, somnambulism, ecstasy, catalepsy,
     electrical attraction, cries and sounds in the air; musical instruments played without being
     touched, intelligent communications, etc. Furthermore, what is no less important is that
     these events were attested to for nearly two years by numerous eyewitnesses worthy of
     being believed because of their knowledge and social position. The official report of the
     occurrences was published at the time by several German newspapers and, particularly, in
     a now-defunct brochure, whose copies are quite rare. However, the complete translation
     of the brochure is contained in Revue Spirite of 1858, with commentaries and necessary
     explanations. As far as we know, that was the only French publication that has made
     reference to it. Besides the fascinating interest that they arouse, such phenomena are
     eminently educational from the point of view of the practical study of Spiritism – Auth.

                               Mediums


should be done. In chapter V, Spontaneous Physical Manifestations, we
already provided some advice on the matter by stating that we must
establish relations with the spirit in order to know what it wants. The
following method is equally based on observation.
       The invisible beings who reveal their presence through
sensible effects are usually low order spirits whom we can control
through moral ascendancy, and it is this condition of ascendancy
that we must endeavor to acquire.
       In order to do so it is necessary that the individual pass
from the state of natural medium to that of facultative medium. An
effect is produced similar to what occurs during somnambulism.
We know that natural somnambulism generally ceases when
replaced by magnetic somnambulism. The liberating faculty of
the soul is not extinguished but is rather given another course
to follow. The same thing happens with the mediumistic faculty.
Instead of preventing the manifestations, which can rarely be
done and is not free of danger, we must teach the medium to
induce them by the will, imposing it upon the spirit. In this way
the medium manages to overpower it, making a dominating
and sometimes tyrannical spirit into a subordinate, frequently
quite docile one. A noteworthy fact is that experience has
confirmed that in such a case a child can have the same or even
greater authority than an adult. This is another proof of the
fundamental principle of the Doctrine, according to which a
spirit is only a child due to its physical body, but has within
itself a development that it had acquired prior to its current
incarnation, which can confer upon it an ascendancy over spirits
who are less evolved.
       The moralization of a spirit through the counsels of a third
influential and experienced individual – if the medium is in no
position to do so – is nearly always an effective means. We shall
return to this subject later.


                                 221

                            Chapter XIV


                     Electrical Persons
        163. It would seem that to this mediumistic category
belong those persons gifted with a certain charge of natural
electricity, who are veritable human torpedoes, producing the
effects of attraction and repulsion through simple contact.
However, it would be erroneous to regard them as mediums, since
true mediumship supposes the direct intervention of a spirit,
and experiments have conclusively shown that in this particular
case electricity is the only agent behind the phenomena. This
strange faculty, which may almost always be regarded as an illness,
can sometimes be linked to mediumship, as seen in the case of
the Spirit-rapper of Bergzabern; however, most of the time it is
completely independent. According to what we have stated, the
sole proof of spirit intervention is the intelligent character of the
manifestations. Whenever this factor is absent, it is most logical to
attribute the phenomena to purely physical causes. The question
still remains as to whether electrical persons might have a greater
aptitude for becoming physical effects mediums. We believe they
would, but only experience will verify it.

     Sensitive or Impressionable Mediums
      164. This label is used to designate individuals capable
of sensing the presence of spirits through a vague impression, a
sort of general shudder of which they do not know the cause.
This variety does not display any well defined characteristics,
however. Mediums are necessarily impressionable, and thus
impressionability is a quality that may be regarded as more
general than special – it is a rudimentary faculty that is
indispensable to the development of all the others. It differs
from purely physical and nervous impressionability, with which

                                222

                               Mediums


it should not be confused, for there are persons who are not
neurologically sensitive but who sense the presence of spirits to
varying degrees, while others who are very susceptible cannot
perceive them at all.
       This faculty develops with habit and can attain such subtlety
that through the sensation received the individual possessing it can
recognize not only the good or evil nature of a nearby spirit, but also
its individuality, as a blind person recognizes the approach of this
or that individual by a sort of sensation. In relation to spirits, this
type of medium is a true sensitive. A good spirit always produces a
soft pleasant impression; an evil one, on the other hand, produces
a painful, anxious and unpleasant impression – it seems to bring
an odor of impurity.

                     Hearing Mediums
       165. These mediums can hear the voice of spirits. As
we stated when discussing pneumatophony, it is sometimes an
internal voice that is heard deep down, while at other times it
is an external voice as clear and distinct as if by a living person.
Hearing mediums can thus converse with spirits and when
they acquire the ability to communicate with certain ones,
they immediately recognize them by the tone of their voice.
Persons who do not possess this faculty can also communicate
with a spirit through a hearing medium, who then acts as an
interpreter.
       This faculty is very pleasing when such mediums hear only
good spirits or those whom they call, but the same is not true
when evil spirits hound them, making them hear every minute the
most disagreeable and often most inappropriate things. In such
cases it is necessary to get rid of them through the method we shall
indicate in the chapter on Obsession.


                                 223

                            Chapter XIV


                   Speaking Mediums
       166. Hearing mediums, who only transmit what they hear,
are not actually speaking mediums, who most of the time do not
hear anything at all. With such mediums, spirits act upon their
vocal organs, just as they act upon the hands of writing mediums.
In order to communicate, a spirit utilizes the most flexible organ
it can find in a particular medium. From one it borrows the hand;
from another, the vocal cords or from a third, the ears. In general,
speaking mediums express themselves without any awareness
of what they are saying, and they nearly always address subjects
completely foreign to their customary ideas, outside their sphere
of knowledge and even beyond the reach of their intelligence.
Although they are perfectly awake and normal during the process,
they rarely remember what they have said. In other words, the
medium’s voice is an instrument that the spirit uses, and through
whom another person can converse with it, as is the case with a
hearing medium.
       Nevertheless, the speaking medium’s passivity is not always
so complete. There are those who have an intuition about what
they are saying at the time they utter the words. We shall focus on
this variety when we address intuitive mediums.

                     Seeing Mediums
       167. Seeing mediums are those gifted with the ability to see
spirits. There are those who enjoy this faculty in a normal state,
who are perfectly awake and who retain a precise memory of what
they have seen. Others display it only in the somnambulistic state
or one close to somnambulism. This faculty is rarely permanent,
since it is almost always the result of a sudden and temporary
crisis. In this category of seeing mediums we may include all

                                224

                               Mediums


individuals gifted with second sight. The ability to see spirits while
dreaming is also a kind of mediumship, but does not comprise
seeing mediumship per se. (We have explained this phenomenon
in chap. VI, Visual Manifestations).
       Like those with second sight, seeing mediums believe they
see through their eyes, but in reality it is their soul who sees, which
is why they can see either with their eyes closed or open. Thus, a
blind person can see spirits as well as someone with normal sight.
It would be interesting to perform a study on this issue to see if
this faculty is more frequent among the blind. Spirits who have
lived on the earth as blind individuals have told us that through
their soul they had a perception of certain objects and that they
were not immersed in total darkness after all.
       168. We must distinguish between accidental and
spontaneous apparitions and the actual faculty for seeing spirits.
The former most frequently occur at the time of the death of loved
or known individuals who have come to serve warning that they
no longer belong to this world. There are numerous examples of
such cases, not to mention those that occur as visions during sleep.
At other times, they are relatives or friends who, although dead for
quite some time, appear to warn us of danger, to provide counsel
or to ask a favor, which normally consists in carrying out some
kind of service that they could not complete while alive, but which
may also entail prayers.
       These apparitions comprise isolated events and always have
an individual and personal character about them; consequently,
they do not comprise a faculty per se. The faculty itself consists in
the ability – if not permanent, at least quite frequent – to see any
spirits at all, even those who are completely unknown. This faculty
is what defines the seeing medium, properly speaking.
       Among seeing mediums there are those who see only evoked
spirits, who can describe in the smallest detail their gestures, facial

                                 225

                             Chapter XIV


expressions, the characteristic outline of their face, their clothing
and even the feelings they express. There are others who possess the
faculty in a more generalized sense, who see the entire surrounding
spirit population going and coming, and, we might say, going
about their daily business.
       169. On one particular evening we were watching a
performance of the opera ‘Oberon’ while seated beside an excellent
seeing medium. A large number of the seats were empty but many
were occupied by spirits who seemed to be watching the performance.
Some were sitting close to various audience members and seemed
to be listening in on their conversations. On the stage, another
scene was occurring: behind the performers, several jovial spirits
were having fun pantomiming them, grotesquely imitating their
movements. More serious spirits, however, appeared to be inspiring
the singers, supporting them by giving them more energy. One of
these stayed next to one of the principal female singers. We judged its
intentions as rather frivolous and after the curtain closed we evoked
it. Upon responding to us it severely reproved our rash judgment: “I
am not what you think; I am her guide, her protector spirit and it is
my responsibility to direct her.” After a few minutes of very serious
conversation, it left us saying, “Goodbye. She is in her dressing-room
and I must watch over her.” We also evoked the spirit of Weber, the
opera’s composer, during the performance and asked him what he
thought of it. “It isn’t bad,” he responded, “but weak; the performers
sing, but that is all. It lacks inspiration. Wait,” he added. “I shall
try to infuse them with a little of the sacred fire!” We then saw him
hovering over the stage above the singers. An emanation appeared to
flow from him to them, enveloping them. At that moment, there was
a visible resurgence of energy amongst them.
       170. Here is another event that proves the influence that
spirits exert upon humans without their knowing about it. We


                                 226

                               Mediums


were watching a theatrical performance like the other one but with
another seeing medium. While we were conversing with a spirit
spectator it told us, “Do you see those two ladies by themselves in
that box in the first tier? Well, I am going to make them leave the
theater.” He then entered the ladies’ box and began to talk to them.
They had been attentively watching the show when they suddenly
looked at each other, seemed to consult each other, then left and
did not return. The spirit then gave us a merry gesture, meaning he
had fulfilled his word, but we did not see him again to ask him for
more explanations. In this manner, we have often been witnesses
of the role that spirits play among the living. We have observed
them in many places where people gather: dances, concerts,
sermons, funerals, weddings, etc., and everywhere we have found
them stimulating evil passions, inciting discord, exciting disputes
and rejoicing in their exploits. Others, on the contrary, fight this
harmful influence but they are rarely listened to.
      171. The faculty for seeing spirits can undoubtedly be
developed but it is one of those whose development should proceed
naturally without being artificially stimulated in order to avoid
being exposed to illusions of the imagination. When we possess
the seed of a faculty, it will sprout by itself. As a rule, we should be
content with the abilities that God has granted us and not seek the
impossible, because if we want even more we run the risk of losing
what we already have.
      When we mentioned that the cases involving spontaneous
apparitions frequently occur (no. 107), we did not mean that
they are very common. Those involving seeing mediums per se
are even rarer and we have many reasons for distrusting those
who claim to have that faculty. One is prudent not to trust them
without positive proof. We are not referring to those who feed the
ridiculous illusion of globular spirits, which we described in no.
108, but those who claim to see spirits in a more rational manner.

                                  227

                            Chapter XIV


Some persons could undoubtedly be sincere though mistaken,
but others may simulate the faculty out of vanity or for ulterior
motives. In judging such cases we must pay special attention to the
person’s character, morality and sincerity; however, it is especially
in the details of the circumstances that we find the surest means of
appraisal. There are circumstances that can leave no doubt, such
as those involving exact descriptions of spirits whom the medium
never had the opportunity to know when they were incarnated.
The following case belongs to this category.
       A widow lady, whose late husband frequently communicated
with her, met a seeing medium one day who did not know her
or her family. The medium said to her, “I see a spirit beside
you.” “Oh,” replied the lady, “that is probably my husband, who
almost never leaves me.” “No,” responded the medium, “it is
a lady of a certain age, who has a strange hairdo and who is
wearing a white headband.”
       Because of this particularity and other descriptive details,
the widow fully recognized her grandmother, whom she had not
even been thinking about at the time. If the medium had only
been faking the faculty, it would have been easier to follow the
widow’s suggestion, but instead of the husband, whom she had
been thinking about, he saw a woman with a unique hairdo, of
which he could have had no idea. Moreover, this case proves that
what the medium saw was not a reflection of any outside thought.
(See no. 102)

              Somnambulistic Mediums
      172. Somnambulism can be considered as a variety of
mediumistic faculty, or rather, we should say that these two types
of phenomena are frequently found together. Somnambulists
act under the influence of their own spirit; it is their own soul


                                228

                              Mediums


who, in moments of emancipation, sees, hears and perceives
beyond the limits of the senses. What they express proceeds from
themselves. Their ideas are generally more correct than during
their normal state and their knowledge is broader since their soul
is free. In other words, they live in anticipation of the spirit life.
Mediums, on the other hand, serve as instruments for an outside
intelligence; they are passive and what they express is not their
own. In sum, somnambulists express their own thoughts, while
mediums express the thoughts of others. However, the spirit who
communicates through an ordinary medium might also do so
through a somnambulist. Frequently, the same state of the soul’s
emancipation during somnambulism makes spirit communication
easier. Many somnambulists see spirits perfectly well and describe
them with the same precision as seeing mediums. They can
converse with them and transmit their thought to us; thus, what
they say beyond the circle of their personal knowledge is almost
always suggested to them by other spirits. The following is a notable
example involving the simultaneous action of the somnambulist’s
spirit and another spirit, who reveals itself unequivocally:
       173. One of our friends employed as a somnambulist a
young boy of 14 or 15 years and of quite low intelligence and
extremely limited education. In the somnambulistic state,
however, he showed extraordinary lucidity and great astuteness.
He displayed his abilities particularly in the treatment of diseases,
having performed numerous healings that were otherwise
considered incurable. One day as he was attending a sick man,
he described the illness with perfect precision, “That is not
enough,” he was told. “Now you must prescribe a remedy.” “I
can’t,” he responded. “My angel doctor isn’t here.” “Who is your
angel doctor?” “The one who prescribes the remedies.” “Then,
you yourself don’t see the remedies?” “Oh, no; didn’t I just say my
angel doctor prescribes them?”

                                 229

                            Chapter XIV


       Thus, in the case of this somnambulist, it was his own spirit
who saw what the disease was and it did not need any assistance,
but the medical prescriptions were made by another spirit. If the
latter was not present, the former could say nothing about them.
By himself, he was only a somnambulist; assisted by whom he called
his angel doctor, he was a somnambulistic medium.
       174. The lucidity of the somnambulistic faculty is one
that depends on the organism, and so it is independent of the
elevation, advancement and moral condition of the subject.
As a result, somnambulists may be very lucid but incapable
of resolving certain issues if their spirit is little-advanced.
Somnambulists who speak by themselves may therefore say good
and bad, true or false things, and use greater or lesser delicacy
and scruples in their procedures, depending on the degree of
elevation or inferiority of their own spirit. In these cases, the
assistance of another spirit may overcome their deficiencies.
However, as is the case with mediums, somnambulists can also
be assisted by lying, frivolous or even evil spirits. This is where
the somnambulist’s moral qualities have an especially large
influence in order to attract good spirits. (See The Spirits’ Book,
sect. on Somnambulism, no. 425, and in this book, the chap. on
The Medium’s Moral Influence).

                    Healing Mediums
      175. We shall here only mention this variety of medium,
because the subject would require a much greater development
than our present purposes will allow. Moreover, we have been
informed that a doctor friend of ours has proposed to address
the subject in a special work on intuitive medicine. We will only
say that this kind of mediumship consists mainly in the gift that


                                230

                             Mediums


some people have of healing by simple touch, by a look or even
a gesture, without resorting to any medication whatsoever. This
will certainly be regarded simply as magnetism, and it is obvious
that the magnetic fluid plays a large role. However, when the
phenomenon is examined with due care, one may easily recognize
the presence of something more. Common magnetization is a bona
fide form of treatment requiring a methodical and regular sequence.
In mediumistic healing, however, matters proceed in an entirely
different manner. All magnetizers are able to heal to some degree if
they know how to go about it correctly, but among healing mediums
the faculty is spontaneous and they sometimes possess it without
ever having heard of magnetism. The intervention of a hidden
power – the characteristic of mediumship – becomes obvious in
certain circumstances, especially when we consider that most of the
individuals who qualify as healing mediums resort to prayer, and
this prayer in itself becomes a true evocation. (See no. 131)
       176. Following are responses we received from the Spirits
on the subject:
       1) May we regard individuals gifted with magnetic power as
forming a variety of mediumship?
       “You should have no questions about that.”
       2) So mediums are intermediaries between spirits and humans,
while magnetizers, who draw upon their own forces, do not appear to
serve as intermediaries for any foreign power.
       “That is an erroneous idea. The magnetic force belongs to
the individuals, but is augmented with the help of the spirits to
whom they appeal for it. For example, if you use magnetism to
heal, and you evoke a good spirit who takes an interest in both you
and the sick person, it augments your own forces and willpower
by directing your fluids and giving them the necessary qualities.”
       3) Nonetheless, there are excellent magnetizers who do not
believe in spirits.

                                         Chapter XIV


       “So do you think that spirits only act upon those who believe
in them? Those who magnetize for good purposes are aided by
good spirits. All those with moral aspirations call to them without
realizing it, in the same way that through the desire for evil and
bad intentions others call to evil ones.”
       4) Would magnetizers who believe in the intervention of spirits
act more effectively?
       “They could do things that would be regarded as miracles.”
       5) Do some individuals actually have the gift of being able to
heal by simple touch without employing magnetic passes?31
       “Certainly; haven’t you seen several examples?”
       6) Do such cases involve magnetic action or only the influence
of spirits?
       “Both. Such individuals are bona fide mediums since they
act under the influence of spirits, but that does not mean that they
are what you understand to be healing mediums, for example.”
       7) Is this power transmittable?
       “Not the power itself, but rather the understanding of what
is needed to exert it when one possesses it. There are those who
would not even suspect they had this power if they did not think
that it had been transmitted to them.”
       8) Can healing be effected through prayer alone?
       “Yes, sometimes God allows this; however, it is sometimes
for sick persons’ own good to continue to suffer, and they then
think their prayers have not been heard.”
       9) Are certain prayer formulas more effective than others for
healing?
       “Only superstition could attribute virtue to certain words,
and only ignorant or deceitful spirits could entertain such an idea
by prescribing formulas. However, for persons who are little-

enlightened and incapable of understanding purely spiritual
matters, the use of a formula might contribute to deepening their
confidence. In such a case, it is not the formula that is effective,
but rather the faith that has been augmented by the belief attached
to the use of the formula.”

            Pneumatographical Mediums
       177. This designation applies to mediums who have an
aptitude for obtaining direct writing, a gift that is not given to
all writing mediums. This faculty has remained quite rare. It can
probably be developed through practice but, as we have stated,
its practical usefulness is limited to its being obvious proof of
the intervention of a concealed power in the manifestations.
Only experience can tell if someone possesses it. Thus, one may
experiment with it just as one may inquire of a protector spirit
through other forms of communication. Depending on the greater
or lesser power of the medium, simple traces, symbols, letters,
words, sentences and even entire pages may be obtained. All that
is usually required is to place a sheet of folded paper somewhere
or in a place designated by the spirit for ten or fifteen minutes or a
bit longer. Prayer and meditation are essential; thus, we consider it
impossible for it to work in non-serious meetings or where persons
are not animated with sentiments of affinity and benevolence.
(See the explanation of direct writing, chap. VIII, Laboratory of
the Invisible World, nos. 127 ff., and chap. XII, Pneumatography).
       We will address writing mediums in particular in the
chapters that follow.

       178. Of all the forms of communication, manual writing
is the simplest, the most convenient, and, especially, the most
complete. All effort should be made to develop it, for it enables
relationships to be established with spirits that are as lasting and
regular as those we maintain amongst ourselves. We stress its use
so highly because it is the method through which spirits best reveal
their nature and the degree of their elevation or lowliness. Through
the ease with which they can express themselves in this way, they
provide us with knowledge of their inmost thoughts, enabling us
to evaluate them and determine their true worth. Moreover, for
the medium this faculty is the most susceptible of being developed
with practice.




                                235

                            Chapter XV


                 Mechanical Mediums
       179. If we examine certain effects that manifest in the
movements of a table, a basket or planchette that writes, we will
have no doubt that a spirit is exerting a direct action upon these
objects. The basket sometimes moves about so violently that
it jumps from the medium’s hands; at other times it will move
toward certain individuals in the circle in order to strike them;
at other times its movements display affection. The same occurs
when a pencil is placed in the medium’s hand. Often, it will fly
out of the hand, or the hand or basket may move convulsively
and angrily tap the tabletop – all this while the medium is
perfectly calm but surprised at not being able to control the
movements. We would state, in passing, that such effects always
denote the presence of less evolved spirits; high order spirits are
always calm and full of dignity and benevolence. If they are not
listened to with proper respect, they withdraw and others take
their place.
       Thus, a spirit can express its thought directly, whether
by moving an object for which the medium’s hand only acts as
support, or by acting directly upon the hand.
       When a spirit acts directly upon the medium’s hand, it
impels it completely independently of the medium’s will. The
hand writes without stopping and despite the medium’s will for as
long as the spirit has something to say, and will then stop when it
has finished.
       What characterizes the phenomenon in this instance is that
the medium is completely unaware of what he or she is writing.
This absolute unawareness characterizes those whom we call
passive or mechanical mediums. This faculty is all the more valuable
since it does not leave the slightest doubt about the independent
thought of the entity doing the writing.


                                236

                  Writing or Psychographic Mediums


                    Intuitive Mediums
       180. The transmission of a spirit’s thought may also
occur by means of the medium’s own spirit, or rather, his or her
soul, since we use that term for the spirit while incarnated. In
this case, the communicating spirit does not act directly upon
the hand in order to make it write, for it neither holds it nor
guides it, but acts upon the soul with which it identifies itself.
Then, under this impulsion, the medium’s soul guides the hand,
which in turn guides the pencil. Here we must note an important
fact: the communicating spirit does not replace the medium’s
soul, because it could not dislodge it from the body; rather, it
dominates it apart from the medium’s will and impresses its own
will on it. Consequently, the soul’s role is not completely passive;
it receives the spirit’s thought and transmits it. In this situation,
the medium is conscious of what is being written, although it is
not a reflection of his or her own thought. This type of person is
called an intuitive medium.
       One might say that there is nothing in this method that
proves that it is another spirit instead of the medium’s own spirit
who does the writing. In fact, the distinction is sometimes quite
difficult to make, but this may not be important, in that one
can recognize the spirit-suggested thoughts by the fact that the
medium has never had such thoughts him or herself; they are
suggested while they are being written down and often are even
contrary to the ideas that the medium previously had regarding
the subject. Moreover, they may be well beyond the knowledge
and capabilities of the medium.
       The role of mechanical mediums is that of a machine,
whereas intuitive mediums act as interpreters. In order to
transmit thoughts, the latter must comprehend them, and in a
sense assimilate them in order to faithfully translate them. But


                                237

                             Chapter XV


the thoughts are not their own; they do nothing more than pass
through their brain. This is precisely the role of intuitive mediums.

             Semi-Mechanical Mediums
       181. In the case of purely mechanical mediums the
movement of the hand is independent of their will, while with
intuitive mediums the movement is voluntary and facultative.
Semi-mechanical mediums, on the other hand, are a blend of
both; that is, they feel their hand being moved without their
willing it to do so, but at the same time they are aware of what
is being written while the words are being formed. With the first,
the medium’s thought appears after the writing; with the second,
before the writing; with the third, while the writing is in process.
Semi-mechanical mediums are the most numerous.

                    Inspired Mediums
       182. All those who either in a normal or an ecstatic state
receive mental communications that are foreign to their own
preconceived ideas may be considered to be inspired mediums. They
may be regarded as an intuitive variety, but with the difference that
the intervention of a concealed power is much less detectible, for
with an inspired medium it is more difficult to distinguish between
the inspired thought itself and the medium’s own thought. What
characterizes the former is especially its spontaneity. We may
receive inspiration from spirits who influence us either for good
or evil, but it is mainly the help of those who want what is good
for us, whose counsels we most often fail to follow. This applies to
all the circumstances of our life, in the decisions we must make.
In this sense we could say that all are mediums since there are
none who do not have their protector and familiar spirits, who do

                                238

                  Writing or Psychographic Mediums


everything they can to transmit good thoughts to their wards. If
everyone were convinced of this truth, they would more frequently
draw upon the inspiration of their guardian angel in moments
when they do not know what to say or do. Let us fervently and
confidently evoke our protector spirit in times of need, and we will
more assiduously wonder at the ideas that arise as if by magic,
whether for help in making a decision or in something to be done.
If no idea arises immediately, then all we must do is wait. The
proof that we are dealing with a suggested idea is precisely in that
if it were our own, it would always have been at our disposal and
there would have been no reason for it not to have manifested at
our beck and call. Those who are not blind only need to open their
eyes whenever they want to see. In the same way, those who have
their own ideas always have them at their disposal, but if they do
not surface when they want them, it is because they must go in
search of them outside themselves.
       In this category we may also include persons who, without
being gifted with exceptional intelligence and without leaving their
normal state, have flashes of intellectual lucidity that endows them
with surprising ease of conception and elocution and, in certain
cases, a presentiment about the future. At such times, which
we rightly call inspirational, ideas abound and follow upon one
another in an involuntary and almost feverish impulse. It seems
like a higher intelligence has come to our aid and that our spirit
has been freed of a great burden.
        183. All geniuses, artists, scholars and literati are
undoubtedly advanced spirits with the ability to comprehend and
conceive of great things, and it is precisely because spirits judge
them as possessing such abilities that, whenever they want to
accomplish certain deeds, they suggest the necessary ideas to them.
It is thus that in most instances they are mediums without realizing
it. Nevertheless, they have a vague intuition of being assisted, for

                                239

                              Chapter XV


those who appeal for inspiration actually make an evocation. If
they expected not to be heard, why would they often exclaim: My
guardian angel, help me!
       The following responses confirm this assertion:
       1) What is the primary cause of inspiration?
       “Mental communication from a spirit.”
       2) Is inspiration only meant for great revelations?
       “No. It is almost always meant for the most common life
circumstances. For example, you want to go somewhere and a
secret voice tells you not to because you would meet with danger,
or this voice suggests that you do something that you had not
thought of. This is inspiration. There are very few people who
have not been inspired on many occasions.”
       3) In moments of inspiration can writers, painters or musicians,
for example, be regarded as mediums?
       “Yes, because in such moments their soul is freer and more
separate from matter, and thus it recovers part of its faculties as a
spirit and more easily receives communications from other spirits
who inspire it.”

                    Prescient Mediums
       184. A presentiment is a vague intuition about future
events. Certain individuals possess this faculty to different degrees
of development. It may be regarded as a type of second sight
that enables them to see the consequences of the present and
the natural chain of events. But they are also often the result of
concealed communications, and it is particularly in these instances
that the individuals so gifted may be called prescient mediums, who
comprise a variety of inspired medium.

     • Special Aptitudes of Mediums • Synoptic Table of the
        Different Varieties • Varieties of Writing Mediums



            Special Aptitudes of Mediums
       185. Besides the mediumistic categories already enumerated,
mediumship offers infinite varieties that include what may be called
special mediums, those gifted with still-undefined particular aptitudes,
apart from the qualities and knowledge of the manifesting spirit.
       The nature of the resulting communication is always related
to the nature of the spirit and bears the stamp of its degree of
evolution, its wisdom or its ignorance. But in spite of similarities
among spirits of the same degree on the hierarchical scale, there
is undeniably a tendency for each spirit to occupy itself with a
particular specialty. Spirits who produce raps, for example, rarely
depart from physical manifestations, while among those who
provide intelligent manifestations there are spirits who are poets,
musicians, painters, scholars, moralists, physicians, etc. We are
referring to spirits of an average order because in a more elevated
degree of the hierarchy the aptitudes blend into the unity of


                                  241

                            Chapter XVI


perfection. However, alongside the aptitude of the spirit itself is
the aptitude of the medium, the instrument that may be either
more appropriate and flexible or less so, and in which the spirit
discovers individual qualities that we cannot always appraise.
       Let us make a comparison: a very skillful musician has several
violins at his disposal, which, to the ordinary person all appear
to be good instruments, but among which the consummate artist
can tell a big difference, perceiving extremely delicate nuances
that will enable him to choose some and reject others, nuances
that he perceives by intuition without being able to define them.
The same applies to mediums: despite the equality of their state
as to mediumistic potency, a spirit will nevertheless prefer one
over another according to the type of communications it wishes
to transmit. As a result, we see, for example, mediums under the
influence of a spirit who writes admirable poetry, even though they
themselves have never been able to make verse in their ordinary
state. Others, on the contrary, are normally poets, but as mediums
they only write prose in spite of their desire to write poems. The
same happens with paintings, music, etc. There are mediums
who, without possessing scientific knowledge, are most capable of
receiving communications of this nature. Others are more skillful
at historical studies; others more easily serve as interpreters for
moralist spirits. In a word, whatever the medium’s flexibility may
be, the communications he or she receives most generally have
a special stamp. Furthermore, there are those who never leave a
determined circle of ideas and when they try to do so, they only
receive incomplete, laconic and often erroneous communications.
Besides the issue of aptitudes, spirits also prefer to communicate
through this or that medium according to the affinity between
them. Thus, in spite of an obvious similarity of conditions, the
same spirit will be more explicit through certain mediums solely
because they are better suited to it.


                                242

                           Special Mediums


        186. It would be wrong to expect to receive good kinds
of communications of every variety just because we have a good
writing medium at our disposal. The first condition is undoubtedly
to be sure about the source of the communications, which means
the qualities of the spirit who transmits them. However, we
must no less surmise the qualities of the mediumistic instrument
offered to the spirit. We must therefore study the nature of the
medium as well as that of the spirit because they are both essential
elements for a satisfactory result. There is, however, a third
element that is equally important: the intent, the inner thought
and the degree of praiseworthiness of whoever interrogates the
spirit. This is easy to understand. In order for a communication to
be a good one, it must come from a good spirit. In order for such a
good spirit to be ABLE to transmit it, it must have a good instrument
at its disposal. In order for it to WANT to transmit it, the objective
must suit it. The spirit, who reads the thought, surmises whether
the proposed question deserves a serious response and whether
the person who formulates it is worthy of a response. If not, it
does not waste time sowing seeds among the stones. That is when
frivolous and mocking spirits take action because, since they are
little concerned about the truth, they do not analyze the subject
as they should and are generally as little scrupulous about the
means as about the ends.
        Let us now summarize the principal kinds of mediumship
in the form of a sort of synoptic table comprised of those that have
already been described in the preceding chapters, indicating the
paragraph numbers in which they are treated in more detail.
        We have grouped the different mediumistic varieties
according to the similarities of cause and effect, but this
classification is in no way absolute. Some are found quite often;
others, to the contrary, are rare and even exceptional – a fact which
we have been careful to point out. These latter indications were all


                                 243

supplied by the Spirits who, furthermore, reviewed this table with
particular care and completed it with several observations and new
categories so that we can say that it is now entirely their own work.
When we have deemed it worthwhile, we have highlighted their
textual observations by using quotation marks.32 Most of them are
by Erastus and Socrates.

                         Synoptic Table of the
                          Different Varieties
        187. We may divide mediums into two large categories:
        PHYSICAL EFFECTS MEDIUMS – Those who have the
power to induce physical effects or ostensive manifestations. (See
no. 160)
        INTELLECTUAL EFFECTS MEDIUMS – Those
who are more especially able to receive and transmit intelligent
communications. (See nos. 65 ff.)
        All the other varieties may be directly linked in various
degrees to one or the other of these two categories and a few fit
into both. By analyzing the various phenomena produced under
mediumistic influence, we see that all of them include a physical
effect of some kind and that such effects almost always appear along
with an intelligent effect of some kind. It is sometimes difficult to
establish a dividing line between both categories, but this does
not present a serious problem. In the classification of intellectual
effects mediums we have included those who can more especially
serve as intermediary instruments for regular and continuous
communications. (See no. 133)
          188. Varieties common to all types of mediumship:

                            Special Mediums


        Sensitive mediums – Individuals who are susceptible to
sensing the presence of spirits through a general or localized, vague
or physical sensation. Most of them distinguish between good and
evil spirits by the nature of the resultant sensation. (See no. 164)
        “Due to the resultant fatigue, delicate and overly sensitive
mediums must abstain from communicating with violent spirits or
those who cause a feeling of tiredness.”
        Natural or unconscious mediums – Those who induce phenomena
spontaneously without the intervention of their own will, and most of
the time without even being aware of it. (See no. 161)
        Facultative or voluntary mediums – Those who have the
ability to induce phenomena through an act of their own will.
(See no. 160)
        “As great as this will may be, they can do nothing if the spirits
refuse to come, which proves the intervention of an exterior power.”
        189. Special physical effects varieties:
        Typtological mediums – Those through whose influence
noises and raps are produced. A common variety, in which the
medium’s will may or may not participate.
        Motor mediums – Those who induce inert objects to move.
Very common. (See no. 61)
        Mediums for displacements and suspensions – Those who
induce the displacement of inert objects or their suspension
in the air without any point of support. They are more or less
rare, depending on the intensity of the phenomenon they can
precipitate. There are also some who can levitate, but they are rarer
still. (See nos. 75 ff. and no. 80)
        Musical effects mediums – Those who induce the playing of
musical instruments without contact. Very rare. (See no. 74, quest. 24)
        Mediums for apparitions – Those who induce fluidic or
tangible apparitions that are visible to those watching. Very rare.

                                   Chapter XVI


        Mediums for apportations – Those who serve spirits for the
carrying of physical objects. A variety of motor and displacement
medium. Exceptional. (See no. 96)
        Nocturnal mediums – Those who obtain certain physical
effects in darkness. Following is a spirit’s response about whether
or not these mediums may be regarded as a separate variety:
        “Certainly, these mediums may represent a specialty, but the
phenomenon is due more to the environmental conditions than to
the nature of the medium or spirit. I should add that some mediums
escape this peculiar influence of the environment, and that with a
little practice most nocturnal mediums could produce the phenomena
in both light and darkness.
        “This variety of medium is not very common and we must
make it clear that it is due to this requirement for darkness that allows
for complete freedom to employ trickery, ventriloquism, and acoustic
tubes, by which charlatans have frequently duped the credulous by
passing themselves off as mediums in order to get money. But it does
not matter. Tricksters in rooms, like tricksters in public squares, will be
cruelly unmasked, and the Spirits will show them that they do wrong
in interfering in their work. Yes, I repeat: certain charlatans shall be
openly and very rudely exposed so that their role as fake mediums will
end – it is only a matter of time.”
                                                                  Erastus

      Pneumatographical mediums – Those who obtain direct
writing. A very rare phenomenon and especially easy to imitate by
charlatanism. (See no. 177)
       Contrary to our own opinion, the Spirits have insisted that we place
       direct writing among the phenomena of the physical order because,
       according to them, “Intelligent effects are those that a spirit produces by
       utilizing the elements present in the medium’s brain, which is not the case
       with direct writing. The medium’s action in this instance is entirely physical,


                                        246

                              Special Mediums


       while in the writing medium, even if completely mechanical, the brain
       always plays an active role.”

        Healing mediums – Those who have the ability to cure or
alleviate illnesses by the imposition of hands or through prayer.
        “This faculty is not essentially mediumistic, because all true
believers possess it whether they are mediums or not. It is frequently no more
than the over-excitation of the magnetic power, which is strengthened, if
needed, by the participation of good spirits.” (See no. 175)
        Developer mediums – Those who have the ability to develop
the writing faculty in others through their influence.
        “There is more of a magnetic effect than a mediumistic one per
se, for it does not indicate the actual intervention of a spirit. In any
case, it belongs to the order of physical effects.” (See chap. on The
Formation of Mediums)
       190. Special intellectual effects mediums; various aptitudes:
       Hearing mediums – Those who hear spirits. Very common.
(See no. 165)
       “There are many individuals who fancy that they hear something
that really only exists in their own imagination.”
       Speaking mediums – Those who speak under the influence of
spirits. Very common. (See no. 166)
       Seeing mediums – Those who see spirits while awake.
The accidental and fortuitous sight of a spirit in a determined
circumstance is very frequent, but the habitual or facultative seeing
of spirits without any distinction is exceptional. (See no. 167)
       “The present condition of your physical organism opposes this
aptitude; thus, it is always prudent at first not to believe those who say
they see spirits.”
       Inspirational mediums – Those who receive thoughts suggested
by spirits, usually without being aware of it, whether for the ordinary
matters of life or for great intellectual works. (See no. 182)


                                     247

                               Chapter XVI


       Prescient mediums – Those who in certain circumstances
have a vague intuition of future common occurrences. (See
no. 184)
       Prophetic mediums – A variety of inspirational or prescient
medium, who receive, with God’s permission, and with greater
precision than prescient mediums, a revelation of future events
of general interest, and who are charged with transmitting it to
others for instructive purposes.
       “If there are true prophets, there are also false ones, who take the
delusions of their own imaginations to be revelations, whereas they are,
in fact, pretenders passing themselves off as prophets out of ambition.”
(See no. 624 of The Spirits’ Book concerning the characteristics of
a true prophet)
       Somnambulistic mediums – those who are assisted by spirits
while in a somnambulistic trance. (See no. 172)
       Ecstatic mediums – those who receive revelations from spirits
while in a state of ecstasy.
       “Many ecstatics are victims of their own imagination and of
deceiving spirits who take advantage of their heightened state. There
are very few who merit complete trust.”
       Painting or drawing mediums – Those who paint or draw
under the influence of spirits. We are referring to those who obtain
serious works, because we could not apply this name to certain
mediums whom mocking spirits cause to produce grotesque works
that the least experienced student would disavow.
       “Frivolous spirits are great imitators. When the famous drawings
of Jupiter appeared, a large number of alleged drawing mediums arose,
with whom mocking spirits had great fun by making them produce
the most ridiculous things. One of these spirits, in order to eclipse the
drawings of Jupiter, if not in quality, then at least in quantity, caused
a medium to draw a monument that required so many sheets of paper
that they could be stacked to the height of a two story building. Many


                                   248

                          Special Mediums


other mediums were made to draw supposed portraits that were merely
caricatures.” (See Revue Spirite, Aug. 1858)
       Musical mediums – Those who compose or perform music
under the influence of spirits. There are mechanical, semi-
mechanical, intuitive and inspirational musical mediums. There
are also literary mediums of the same nature. (See the section on
Musical Effects Mediums)

           Varieties of Writing Mediums
       191. 1) According to the method of execution:
       Writing or psychographical mediums – Those who have the
ability to write by themselves while under the influence of spirits.
       Mechanical writing mediums – Those who write by receiving
an involuntary impulse of their hand without being conscious of
what they are writing. Very rare. (See no. 179)
       Semi-mechanical mediums – Those who write under an
involuntary impulse of their hand, but who are immediately
conscious of the words and sentences they are writing. The most
common. (See no. 181)
       Intuitive mediums – Those who receive communications
from spirits mentally, but who write by their own will. They
differ from inspirational mediums, who do not necessarily
have to write. Intuitive mediums, on the other hand, register
thought, which is rapidly suggested concerning a specific topic.
(See no. 180)
       “These are quite common but they are also very prone to err
because they often cannot discern what comes from the spirit from
what comes from themselves.”
       Polygraphical mediums – Those who change their
handwriting according to the communicating spirit, or who have
the ability to duplicate the handwriting that the communicating


                                249

                              Chapter XVI


spirit exhibited during its lifetime. The former is very common;
the latter – identical handwriting – is rarer. (See no. 219)
       Polyglot mediums – Those who have the faculty of speaking
or writing in unknown languages. Very rare.
       Illiterate mediums – Those who write only as mediums, since
they can neither read nor write in their normal state.
       “Much rarer than the preceding types. There is a greater physical
difficulty to overcome.”
       192. 2) According to the development of the faculty:
       Novice mediums – Those whose faculties are not yet completely
developed and who do not yet possess the necessary experience.
       Unproductive mediums – Those who only receive
unimportant things: monosyllables, letters or strokes. (See chap.
on the Formation of Mediums)
       Developed or fully formed mediums – Those who have
their mediumistic faculties fully developed and who transmit
communications easily, rapidly and without hesitation. We
should understand that these mediums’ abilities can only be
obtained through practice, whereas among novice mediums the
communications are slow and difficult.
       Laconic mediums – Those who receive communications
easily but which are brief and undeveloped.
       Explicit mediums – Those who receive broad and lengthy
communications like those one would expect from a consummate
writer.
       “This aptitude is related to the ease with which the fluids are
combined. Spirits seek out these mediums in order to address subjects
that require great development.”
       Experienced mediums – Ease of writing is a matter of practice
and can be obtained relatively quickly, whereas experience is the
result of seriously studying all the difficulties that may arise in
the practice of Spiritism. Experience confers upon mediums the

                                  250

                           Special Mediums


necessary tact for appraising the nature of the spirits who manifest,
for determining through the smallest indications their good or
evil qualities and for discerning the trickery of deceptive spirits
who disguise themselves with the appearance of truth. We easily
comprehend the importance of this quality, without which all
others would lose their real usefulness. The problem is that many
mediums confuse experience – the fruit of study – with an ability
arising solely from the organism. They deem themselves to be
masters because they write easily, but they reject all counsel and
become the prey of deceitful and hypocritical spirits who latch onto
them by flattering their pride. (See the next chap. on Obsession)
       Flexible mediums – Those who possess faculties that more
easily lend themselves to the diverse kinds of communications,
and through whom all or nearly all spirits can manifest either
spontaneously or through evocation.
       “This variety of medium is very close to the sensitive type.”
       Exclusive mediums – Those who are preferred by a certain
spirit, even to the exclusion of all others. This spirit responds in
the stead of all others who are called through the medium.
       “This always results from a lack of flexibility. When the spirit
is good, it may link itself to the medium out of affinity and for a
praiseworthy purpose; when it is evil, however, it always aims to
submit the medium to its control. It is more of a defect than a quality
and is very close to obsession.” (See chapter on Obsession)
       Mediums for evocations – Flexible mediums are naturally more
appropriate for this kind of communication and are more able to
respond to the specific questions that are addressed to them. However,
for cases of evocation there are also entirely specialized mediums.
       “Their responses are almost always confined to a limited area
and are incompatible with the development of general topics.”
       Mediums for spontaneous communications – Those who receive
spontaneous communications by spirits who have not been called.


                                 251

                              Chapter XVI


When mediums have this faculty, it is difficult and sometimes
impossible to evoke a spirit by using them as an intermediary.
       “Nevertheless, they are better equipped than those of the
evocation variety. The term ‘equipped’ should be understood as
referring to the cerebral elements because a more developed intelligence
is often more necessary – I would even say always necessary – for
spontaneous communications than for evocations. Here, ‘spontaneous
communications’ means those that truly merit the designation and not
a few incomplete sentences or a few banal thoughts that are generally
found in human remarks.”
      193. 3) According to the type and specialty of the
communications:
      Verse-making mediums – Those who most easily receive
communications in verse. Very common for bad verse; very rare
for good verse.
      Poetic mediums – Although they do not receive verse per
se, they do receive communications of a vaporous, sentimental
style without any harsh quality about them. They are more able
than the others at expressing tender and affectionate sentiments.
Everything in their communications is vague, and it would not be
worthwhile to require anything precise from them. Very common.
      Positive mediums – Generally, their communications display
a clean and precise character, which spontaneously lends itself to
circumstantial details and exact teachings. Very rare.
      Literary mediums – Those who do not display the vague tone
of poetic mediums or the down-to-earth tone of positive mediums,
but who write with sagacity. Their style is correct, elegant and
frequently of notable eloquence.
      Incorrect mediums – Those who obtain very good
communications and thoughts displaying irreproachable morality,
but whose style is diffuse, incorrect and full of repetitions and
improper terms.

                                  252

                             Special Mediums


       “The material incorrectness of style usually stems from the
medium’s lack of education; this type of medium consequently does
not serve as a good instrument for the spirit. However, the spirit
attaches little importance to this matter, since for it thought is what is
essential, and so it leaves the medium free to provide the appropriate
form. The same does not apply to erroneous and illogical ideas that
may be communicated, which are always an indication of the low
evolutionary degree of the manifesting spirit.”
       Historian mediums – Those who have a special aptitude
for historical dissertations. Like all others, this faculty does not
depend on the medium’s own knowledge, for there are uneducated
individuals – even children – who address subjects far beyond their
reach. A rare variety of positive medium.
       Scientific mediums – We do not say scientists, because these
may be very uneducated; despite this, however, they are especially
able to receive communications related to the sciences.
       Medical mediums – Their specialty is that of most easily
serving spirits as interpreters for medical prescriptions. They must
not be confused with healing mediums, because they do nothing
more than transmit the spirit’s thought and do not exert any
influence in and of themselves. Quite common.
       Religious mediums – Those who more especially receive
communications of a religious character or address questions
related to religion, notwithstanding their own beliefs and practices.
       Philosophical/moralist      mediums        –     Those      whose
communications generally address moral issues or profound
philosophy. Very common for moral issues.
       “All these nuances comprise a diversity in the aptitudes of good
mediums. As for those who have special aptitudes for certain scientific,
historical, medical and other communications above their current
reach, we can be certain that they possessed such knowledge in another
existence and have retained it in a latent state, thereby making up


                                   253

                                  Chapter XVI


part of the cerebral elements needed for a spirit’s communication.
These elements are what make it easy for the spirit to transmit its own
ideas, since these mediums are for the spirit instruments who are more
intelligent and malleable than an ignorant one would be.”
                                                               Erastus

       Mediums for trivial and obscene communications:
       These words indicate the kind of communications that
certain mediums habitually receive and the nature of the spirits
who transmit them. Whoever has studied the spirit world in all
its degrees knows that there are spirits whose perversity is on par
with that of the most depraved individuals, and who are pleased
to express their thoughts through the grossest words. Others, who
are less abject, content themselves with trivial expressions. It is
understandable that these mediums should desire to free themselves
from being preferred by such spirits, and aspire to be like those
who receive communications that never display an unseemly word.
Only through a strange mental aberration and a lack of good sense
could one believe that such language could come from good spirits.
       194. 4) According to the medium’s physical qualities:
       Calm mediums – Those who always write at a rather slow
pace without the least agitation.
       Fast mediums – Those who write with a speed that they
could not voluntarily produce in their normal state. Spirits
communicate with them at the speed of lightning. One could say
that they possess a super-abundance of fluid, which enables them
to instantly identify with a spirit. Because of the speed, however,
this quality has the inconvenience of rendering the writing almost
illegible to all except the medium him or herself.
       “It is also very tiring because it uselessly wastes a great deal of fluid.”
       Convulsive mediums – Those who remain in an over-excited,
almost feverish state. Their hand – sometimes their entire body –

                                       254

                           Special Mediums


trembles in such a way that they cannot control it. The cause is
undoubtedly in their own physical composition, but much also
depends on the nature of the spirits who communicate through
them. Good and benevolent spirits produce an agreeable and gentle
impression; evil ones, on the other hand, a painful impression.
      “These mediums should rarely use their faculty, because frequent
use can adversely affect their nervous system.” (See chap. on Identity,
Distinction between Good and Evil Spirits)
       195. 5) According to the medium’s moral qualities:
       We only mention these mediums in passing at this point
in order to complete the table, since we shall address them in
the following special chapters: The Moral Influence of Mediums,
Obsession, The Identity of Spirits, and others for which we ask
particular attention. We will observe the influence that the
qualities and shortcomings of mediums can exert on the reliability
of the communications, and which mediums can rightly consider
themselves to be imperfect or good mediums.
      196. Imperfect mediums:
      Obsessed mediums – Those who cannot free themselves of
importunate and deceptive spirits, but who are nonetheless not
fooled by them.
      Deluded mediums – Those who are fooled by deceptive spirits
and delude themselves about the nature of the communications
they receive.
      Subjugated mediums – Those who are morally and often
physically dominated by evil spirits.
      Frivolous mediums – Those who do not take their faculty
seriously but use it only as entertainment or for useless purposes.
      Indifferent mediums – These take no moral advantage of the
instructions they receive, nor do they change anything about their
conduct and habits.


                                 255

                              Chapter XVI


       Presumptuous mediums – Those who claim that they are in
touch only with highly evolved spirits. They deem themselves
infallible and regard whatever does not come through themselves
as inferior and erroneous.
       Proud mediums – Those who flatter themselves because of
the communications they receive. They think they have nothing
more to learn about Spiritism and do not take to heart the lessons
they frequently receive from spirits. They are not content with the
faculties they currently possess – they want all of them.
       Susceptible mediums – A variety of proud medium, who take
offense at the criticisms leveled at their communications. They are
hurt by the least remark against them. When they display what
they have received, it is meant to elicit admiration rather than an
opinion. They usually have an aversion for persons who do not
lavish praise upon them and avoid meetings in which they cannot
impose themselves and dominate.
       “Let them strut about elsewhere and seek a more complacent
audience – or let them keep entirely to themselves. Meetings without
their presence lose nothing.”
                                                             Erastus

       Mediums for hire – Those who exploit their faculties.
       Ambitious mediums – Those who, even though they do not
actually sell their abilities, nonetheless hope to get something for them.
       Bad faith mediums – Those who, despite having real abilities,
pretend to have others in order to appear more important.
However, we cannot label as mediums those persons who, having
no mediumistic faculty whatsoever, only produce false phenomena
through charlatanism.
       Selfish mediums – Those who only employ their abilities
for their own use and keep the communications they receive to
themselves.


                                   256

                            Special Mediums


     Jealous mediums – Those who regard with spite those
mediums who are more appreciated and more highly developed.
     All these bad qualities necessarily have their counterpart in
good mediums.
        197. Good mediums:
        Serious mediums – Those who only use their abilities for the
good and for truly useful purposes. They regard it as a profanation
to put them at the service of curious and indifferent persons or for
useless purposes.
        Modest mediums – Those who attribute no merit to
themselves for the communications they receive no matter how
good they may be. They feel foreign to the communications and
do not imagine themselves to be beyond deception. Instead of
running from impartial criticism, they ask for it.
        Devoted mediums – Those who understand that true
mediums have a mission to fulfill and that, when necessary, they
must sacrifice their likes, habits, pleasures, time and even their
material interests for the good of others.
        Trustworthy mediums – Those who, besides the ease with
which they receive communications, merit great confidence due
to their own character and the elevated nature of the spirits who
assist them; they are less likely to be deceived. Later, we shall see
that this trustworthiness has nothing to do with the respectability
of the names taken by spirits.
        “It is undeniable, and you must well understand, that by exposing
the qualities and defects of mediums in this way you will provoke
annoyance and even animosity on the part of some. But what does it
matter? Mediumship is expanding more and more, and mediums who
were to take these remarks badly would only show that they are not good
mediums, which means that they are actually assisted by less evolved
spirits. Moreover, as I have already stated, all this shall quickly pass,
and bad mediums who abuse their abilities or put them to bad use will

                                  257

                              Chapter XVI


suffer sad consequences – as has already been the case with some. They
will learn at their own cost the consequences for turning a gift that God
has given them for their own moral progress into satisfying their earthly
passions. If you cannot lead them back onto the moral path, pity them,
for you may say that God has reproved them.”
                                                                  Erastus

       “This table is of great importance not only for the sincere
mediums who, in reading it, will seek in good faith to save themselves
from the stumbling blocks to which they may be exposed, but also
for all those who make use of mediums, because it will provide them
with a measure of what they can reasonably expect. The table, as
well as the spirit-scale which is its supplement, should constantly
be before those who concern themselves with manifestations. These
two tables summarize all the principles of the Doctrine and will
contribute more than you might think toward leading Spiritism
onto its true path.”
                                                              Socrates

       198. All the above mediumistic varieties present innumerable
degrees of intensity. There are many that strictly speaking do not
comprise more than simple nuances, but are nevertheless the result
of special aptitudes. We must realize that only very rarely is the
mediumistic faculty strictly limited to one type. A medium can
undoubtedly have several aptitudes, but there will always be a
predominant one, and this is the one that should be cultivated if
it is useful. It is a grave mistake to want to in any way force the
development of a faculty that one does not possess. On the other
hand, it is necessary to cultivate all those that one possesses in a
germinal state; however, to seek others is a waste of time in the first
place, and in the second it could mean the loss and certainly the
weakening of those that already exist.


                                  258

                             Special Mediums


        “When the principle or seed of a faculty exists, it always expresses
itself through unmistakable signs. If they would limit themselves to
their own specialty, mediums could perfect it and obtain grand and
beautiful results. However, if they concern themselves with everything,
they will not get any good results. In passing, it should be noted that the
desire to indefinitely extend the ambit of one’s faculties is pretentious
pride, which the Spirits never leave unpunished. Good spirits always
forsake the presumptuous, who then become the target of deceiving
ones. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see mediums who are not
content with the faculties they have received and who, out of vanity or
ambition, aspire to possess exceptional ones that they believe will make
them famous. Such pretence takes away their most precious quality:
being regarded as trustworthy mediums.”
                                                                  Socrates


       199. Studying the specialties of mediums is necessary not
only for mediums themselves, but also for those who call upon
them. According to the nature of the spirit whom one may want
to evoke, and depending on the questions one wishes to ask, it
is imperative to choose the most capable medium. Resorting to
the first one who comes along is to expose oneself to receiving
unsatisfactory or erroneous responses. Let us make a comparison
using ordinary facts. We would not trust an original draft or even
a simple copy to the first person to come along only because he
or she knew how to write. A musician wants an excerpt of a song
he has composed to be performed. There are several singers at
his disposal, all of whom are skillful; however, he will not choose
at random. For his interpreter he will try to find the one who
has the voice, the capacity for expression – all the qualities that
best correspond to the nature of the piece. Spirits do likewise
concerning mediums, as we must do likewise concerning spirits.


                                    259

                            Chapter XVI


      We must further note that the variations presented through
mediumship and to which others may be added, are not always
according to the character of the mediums themselves. Thus, for
example, a naturally joyful and jovial medium may habitually
receive serious – even severe – communications, and vice versa.
This is yet another proof that mediums act under the impulse of
an outside influence. We shall return to this subject in the chapter
dealing with the moral influence of the medium.

        The Development of Mediumship
        200. We are here particularly addressing writing mediumship
because this is the most widespread kind, and also because it is at
the same time the simplest and most convenient, and the one that
provides the most satisfactory and complete results. Furthermore,
it is the one most sought after. At present, unfortunately, there
is still no means of diagnosing, even roughly, those who possess
this faculty. The physical signs that some take as indications are
uncertain, and we may find it in children, old people, men and
women, whatever their temperament, health status or degree of
intellectual and moral development may be. There is only one way
to ascertain its existence: experimentation.
        As we have already seen, writing may be obtained by
using baskets and planchettes or directly by hand. Since this last

                               261

                                         Chapter XVII


method is the easiest and the only one used nowadays, it is the
one we recommend. The process is quite simple, consisting merely
in taking a pencil and paper and putting oneself in a writing
position; no other preparation is needed. Nonetheless, several
recommendations are indispensable for obtaining a good result.
      201. As for the physical conditions, we recommend
avoiding anything that might impede the free movement of the
hand – it is preferable that it not entirely rest upon the paper.
The point of the pencil should maintain enough contact to write
but not so much as to offer any resistance. All these precautions
are of no import, however, when the medium begins to write
fluently, for then no obstacle at all can deter the hand. They are
only preliminaries for the beginner.
       202. It does not matter whether a pen or pencil is used.
Some mediums prefer a pen, but it will only work for those who
are fully-developed and who write calmly. There are mediums who
write so quickly that using a pen would be nearly impossible or
at least very inconvenient.33 The same applies when the writing is
jerky or irregular, or when dealing with violent spirits who tap the
point and break it, tearing the paper.
       203. The desire of all aspirants to mediumship is of course
to be able to converse with the spirits of loved ones, but any
impatience must be moderated because communication with a
particular spirit nearly always presents physical difficulties that
render doing so impossible for the novice. In order for a spirit to
be able to communicate, there must be between it and the medium
certain fluidic combinations, which are not always immediately
established. Only to the degree that his or her mediumship
develops will the medium little by little acquire the aptitude
33
     At that time, of course, pens consisted of quills or points that had to be continually dipped
     in ink – Tr.



                                               262

                      The Development of Mediums


needed to communicate with the first spirit who presents itself
at the time. However, it could also be that the longed-for spirit is
not in a favorable condition to communicate in spite of actually
being present, or that it is neither able nor permitted to respond
to the evocation. Thus, it is best if in the beginning the medium
refrains from evoking a particular spirit to the exclusion of any
other, since fluidic relations often cannot be very easily established
between the two no matter how much affinity there may be.
Consequently, before thinking about receiving communications
from this or that spirit, it is first necessary to develop the faculty
by making a generalized evocation, and especially by addressing
one’s guardian angel.
       There are no sacramental formulas. Whoever claims to
recite a formula that draws spirits may be firmly branded as an
imposter, since formulas mean nothing to spirits. Nevertheless, the
evocation must always be made in God’s name. We may begin an
evocation of a spirit by using the following phrases or similar ones:
I pray that Almighty God will allow a good spirit to communicate
with me by causing me to write; I also pray to my guardian angel to
assist me and protect me from evil spirits. Then, we wait for a spirit
to manifest itself by causing us to write something. It could be that
the spirit whom we had hoped for will in fact manifest itself, or it
could be an unknown one or even our guardian angel. In any case,
it will usually identify itself by writing its name. This brings up
the problem of identity, a problem that requires much experience
to deal with because there are few novices who are not exposed to
the possibility of being fooled. We shall soon address this issue in
a special chapter.
       When we want to call certain spirits, it is essential that we first
address those whom we know to be good and attuned to us, and
who might have a reason to answer, such as relatives and friends.
Thus, we might make an evocation along these lines: In the name


                                   263

                             Chapter XVII


of Almighty God, I pray that the spirit of (name) will communicate
with me, or I pray to Almighty God to allow the spirit of (name) to
communicate with me, or other words to that effect. Also, the first
questions must be formulated in a way that the answers may be
given as simply yes or no; for example, Are you here? Do you wish
to answer? Can you make me write? etc. Later on, this precaution
will be unnecessary. In the beginning, however, it is a means of
establishing a relationship. The essential thing is that the question
not be useless, that it not refer to private matters, and especially
that it express a benevolent and sympathetic sentiment toward the
spirit to whom it is addressed. (See special chapter on Evocations).
       204. A more important guideline to observe than the
manner of making the appeal is calmness and meditation combined
with an ardent desire and a firm will to succeed. By ‘will’ we do not
mean an ephemeral and inconsistent desire, allowing ourselves at
any moment to be interrupted by other matters, but a serious and
persevering determination sustained with firmness and without
impatience or anxiousness. Meditation is aided by solitude, silence
and the avoidance of anything that could cause a distraction. Thus,
there is nothing more to it except this: renew the attempt every day
for ten or fifteen minutes at the most each time for fifteen days, a
month, two months – more if needed. We know of mediums who
only began to display their abilities after six months of practice,
whereas others began to write correctly from the start.
       205. In order to avoid futile attempts, one could question a
serious and high order spirit through another medium. However,
it is worthwhile to remember that when we propose a question to
spirits to find out whether or not we possess mediumship, they
almost always answer in the affirmative, which nevertheless does
not mean that there will not be many unfruitful attempts. This may
easily be explained. If a generalized question is posed to a spirit, it


                                 264

                     The Development of Mediums


will respond in a generalized manner. We know that nothing is
more flexible than the faculty of mediumship, for it may appear
under the most varied forms and to the most diverse degrees. Thus,
one may be a medium without realizing it or in a different sense
than one would expect. To the vague question: Am I a medium? The
spirit will respond: Yes. To the more precise question: Am I a writing
medium? It might respond: No. One must also take the nature of
the spirit being questioned into account. There are spirits who are
so frivolous and so ignorant that they respond at random like true
hair-brains. That is why we advise addressing enlightened spirits,
who usually willingly respond to one’s questions and point out the
best course to follow – if there is to be a possibility of success.
       206. An approach that almost always yields good results
is the use of a good, flexible and already-developed medium as a
temporary aid. If this medium places his or her hands or fingers
upon the hand that is to do the writing, it is rare that it will
not begin to move immediately. We may easily understand what
occurs in such an instance: the hand holding the pencil becomes a
kind of appendage of the medium’s own hand, much like a basket
or planchette. However, this does not mean the exercise is not
very useful when employed, because if it is repeated frequently
and regularly, it will help to overcome any physical obstacles and
enable the faculty to develop. It is also sometimes sufficient to
intently magnetize the arm and hand of the one who desires to
write. Often, all the magnetizer has to do is place his or her hand
on the person’s shoulder; we have seen individuals immediately
begin to write under such influence. The same effect may be
obtained without any contact whatsoever and by a simple effort
of the will. It is easy to understand that the confidence of the
magnetizer in his or her ability to produce such a result must play
a large role, and that an incredulous magnetizer will exert a weak
influence or none at all.

                                 265

                            Chapter XVII


       The help of experienced guides is also sometimes very useful
to point out a number of small precautions that novices usually
neglect to the detriment of the speed at which they progress. It is
especially useful for these guides to inform novices as to the nature
of their first questions and the way in which they should be asked.
Their role is that of a teacher who is no longer needed when the
student becomes sufficiently skillful.
        207. Another method that can also contribute a great deal to
the faculty’s development consists in gathering a certain number of
individuals together, who are all animated with the same desire and
intent. While waiting in absolute silence and spiritual meditation,
they all simultaneously experiment with writing, each appealing
to his or her guardian angel or to some sympathetic spirit. One of
them can also make a generalized appeal to good spirits on behalf
of all the members of the group, without special designation, and
say, for example: In the name of Almighty God, we pray that good
spirits will communicate through the persons gathered here. It is rare
that among them there are not a few who promptly show signs of
mediumship or who even write fluently in just a short time.
        It is easy to understand what occurs in such an instance.
Individuals gathered together for the same purpose form a
collective whole, whose power and sensitivity increases through a
kind of magnetic influence, which aids the faculty’s development.
Among the spirits attracted by this assembly of wills there are those
who find the instrument that best suits them in the midst of the
participants; if it is not one, then it will be another.
        This method should be particularly employed by Spiritist
groups that have no mediums available or that do not have them
in sufficient number.
      208. Means have been sought for finding processes for the
developing of mediums as well as means for diagnosing mediumship.


                                 266

                      The Development of Mediums


However, at present, we know of no other means that are more
effective than the ones we have just prescribed. By supposing that the
obstacle to developing the ability is entirely physical, some individuals
attempt to overcome it through a kind of gymnastics that can almost
dislocate the arm and the head. We will not describe this process,
which has come to us from across the Atlantic, not only because we
have no proof of its effectiveness, but because we are convinced that
it could actually be dangerous to delicate constitutions by harming
the nervous system. If the seeds of the faculty are not there, nothing
will work, not even the use of electricity, which some have already
employed without success.
       209. Faith is not an obligatory condition for beginners.
There is no doubt that it aids the effort, but it is not indispensable.
Pure intentions, desire and good will are enough. We have seen
completely disbelieving persons become startled at writing
without wanting to, while sincere believers cannot produce a
single thing, which shows that the faculty is somehow related to
organic predispositions.
       210. The first indication of the ability to write is a sort of
quivering in the arm or hand. Little by little the hand is seized by
an impulse that it cannot control. Almost always, in the beginning,
only meaningless symbols are traced. Later, the characters become
more precise, and finally the writing progresses to end up acquiring
the necessary speed. In all cases, however, it is always necessary
to abandon the hand to its natural movement, that is, the hand
should be neither hindered nor assisted.
       Some mediums write fluently and easily from the start,
sometimes even from the very first session, but that is quite rare.
Others, for a long time, only succeed at strokes and handwriting
exercises. The Spirits say that it is to loosen up their hand. If
these exercises are too prolonged or degenerate into meaningless


                                  267

                             Chapter XVII


scratches, it is undoubtedly a spirit having fun, because good spirits
do nothing useless. In such a case, the fervor in appealing to the
good spirits should be doubled. If despite this there is no change,
one should stop once one notices that nothing worthwhile is going
to occur. One may make a daily attempt but should stop at the
first equivocal symbol in order not to provide an opportunity for
mocking spirits.
       One spirit added to these observations: “There are mediums
whose faculty cannot go beyond such symbols. When after a few months
they obtain nothing more than insignificant responses such as a ‘yes’ or
a ‘no’, or isolated letters, it would be useless to persist and a waste
of paper.” These are mediums, but unproductive ones. Moreover,
the first communications should only be considered as mere
exercises that are entrusted to secondary spirits, a reason for not
attributing anything more to them beyond a mediocre value. They
should be regarded as spirits employed (so to speak) as writing-
masters, who train the novice medium. We should never believe
that high order spirits would lead the medium to perform these
preparatory exercises. In addition, if the medium does not have a
serious objective, these preparatory spirits may remain and attach
themselves to him or her. Nearly all mediums pass through this
test in order to develop. It is their responsibility to win the affinity
of truly highly evolved spirits.
       211. The main difficulty encountered by most novice
mediums involves having to deal with less evolved spirits, and
they should consider themselves fortunate when such spirits are
merely frivolous. All their attention should be employed not to
allow them to gain a foothold, for once they are firmly attached,
it is not always easy to break free of them. This is of paramount
importance, especially at the beginning, in which, without taking
the necessary precautions, it is possible to lose the fruits of the
finest abilities.

                                  268

                    The Development of Mediums


       The first precaution is for mediums to arm themselves with
sincere faith under the protection of God, asking the assistance of
their guardian angel. This spirit is always good, whereas familiar
spirits, who are attuned to the good or bad qualities of the medium,
may be frivolous or even evil.
       The second precaution is for them to dedicate themselves
with scrupulous care to recognizing, through all the indications
that experience offers, the nature of the first communicating
spirits, whom it is always prudent to distrust. If the indications
are suspect, they should fervently appeal to their guardian angel
and repel the evil spirit with all their might in order to discourage
it by showing that it cannot deceive them. That is why a study
of the Doctrine beforehand is indispensable if the medium
intends to avoid the trouble that is inseparable from a lack of
experience. Fully developed instructions for this matter may be
found in the chapters on Obsession and The Identity of Spirits.
Here we will limit ourselves to stating that besides language,
we can consider infallible indications of less evolved spirits as
including all useless or childish signs, figures, and symbols,
and any kind of bizarre, irregular and intentionally malformed
writing, whether exaggerated in size or ridiculous and unusual
in form. Nevertheless, the writing can be very bad, even barely
legible, without being unusual, a fact that might depend more
on the medium than the spirit itself. We have seen mediums who
are so badly deceived that they measured the superiority of the
spirits by the size of the letters, assigning great importance to
well-formed ones that appeared to be imprinted characters – a
childishness that is really incompatible with true superiority.
      212. If mediums must avoid unwillingly falling under the
dominance of evil spirits, they should even more avoid voluntarily
handing themselves over to them. An uncontrolled desire to write
should not lead them to believe in the first spirit that comes along,

                                269

                                          Chapter XVII


not even with the intention of freeing themselves from it later on
when it no longer serves them. Anyone will suffer the consequences
of asking for assistance in any matter whatsoever from an evil
spirit, who may demand a very steep price for its services.
        Some individuals, who have become impatient with their
mediumistic development because it seems to be progressing too
slowly, get the idea of seeking the help of any spirit whatsoever,
even an evil one, planning to send it away later on. Many are
quickly answered and immediately begin to write; however,
the spirits, not at all minding having been summoned as a last
resort, show themselves quite unmanageable when it comes time
to leave. We have known mediums who were punished for their
presumptuousness in thinking that they were strong enough to
send such spirits away at will. They were submitted to years of
obsession of every kind through the most outrageous hoaxes,
through tenacious fascination34 or even through physical disasters
and the cruelest disappointments. The spirit at first showed itself
to be plain evil but later became hypocritical by trying to make the
medium believe that it had reformed, or by pretending that it was
actually under the power of the medium, who could supposedly
expel it whenever desired.
       213. The writing is sometimes quite legible, with the words
and letters perfectly salient, but with certain mediums the writing
is difficult to decipher by anybody other than the person who
has written it, making it necessary to become accustomed to it.
Quite often the writing consists of large strokes – spirits are not
concerned with saving paper. Whenever a word or sentence is hard
to read, we ask the spirit to please write it again, which it usually
does willingly. Whenever the writing is habitually illegible, even
to the medium, he or she can nearly always render it clearer with

34
     See definition of this term below in chap. XXVII – Tr.



                                                270

                    The Development of Mediums


frequent and sustained practice performed with much willpower
and by arduously beseeching the spirit to be more accurate. Often,
some spirits adopt conventional marks, which they use during
habitual meetings. For example, to show that it finds a question
disagreeable and that it does not wish to respond, it will draw a
long stroke or other such indication.
        When the spirit reaches the end of what it wanted to say or
no longer wants to respond, the medium’s hand becomes still, and
no matter what his or her ability or willpower may be, not another
word will be obtained. On the other hand, when the spirit has
not yet finished, the pencil continues without the hand being able
to stop it. If the spirit wants to say something spontaneously, the
hand compulsively picks up the pencil and begins to write without
being able to oppose it. Moreover, the medium almost always feels
something that indicates whether there has only been a pause in
the communication or whether the spirit has indeed finished, and
it is rare that the medium does not sense the spirit’s departure.
        These are the most important explanations we have to give in
addressing psychographic development. With practice, experience
will bring certain details to light which would not be worthwhile
to discuss at present, and general principles will clarify how to
approach them. If people would only experiment, more mediums
would appear than was thought possible.
       214. Everything we have stated so far applies to mechanical
writing, which is the faculty that all mediums seek with good
reason to develop. Yet, a purely mechanical function is very rare
and quite frequently intuition is coupled with it to some degree.
When mediums are aware of what they are writing, they are
naturally led to doubt their ability, not knowing if the writing
is their own or if it is from a spirit. They should not be overly
concerned about it, however, and should proceed in spite of their
doubt. By careful self-observation, they will easily recognize in the

                                271

                             Chapter XVII


writings many matters that do not pertain to themselves, or which
are even contrary to their own thoughts – ample proof that they
did not originate in their own mind. If they will continue, their
doubt will dissipate with experience.
       215. If certain mediums are unable to be exclusively
mechanical, all attempts to obtain this result will be futile, but they
would be mistaken to suppose they had been deprived altogether.
If they are endowed only with intuitive mediumship, they should
be content with it because it will render them a great service if they
know how to take advantage of it instead of repudiating it.
       After futile attempts have been made for quite some time,
if there is no indication of involuntary movement, or if there
are only movements that are too weak to produce results, one
should not hesitate to write the first thought that comes to mind,
without being concerned as to whether it is one’s own or another’s:
experience will teach how to make the distinction. Besides, the
mechanical movement will often develop later on.
       We have stated above that there are cases in which it does
not matter if a thought comes from the medium or from a spirit.
This is especially true when purely intuitive or inspired mediums
are writing a work involving their own imagination. In such a case,
it matters little whether or not a thought has been suggested to
them. If worthwhile ideas occur to them, they should thank their
good spirit, who will then suggest more ideas to them. This is how
poets, philosophers and scientists are inspired.
      216. Let us now suppose that the mediums’ faculty has
been completely developed, that they write easily and are what
we might call fully-developed mediums. It would be a big mistake
on their part to regard themselves as being no longer in need of
further instruction, since they will have merely overcome the
physical resistance; it is now that the true difficulties begin and


                                 272

                      The Development of Mediums


that now, more than ever, they will need the advice of prudence
and experience if they do not want to fall into the thousands of
traps that will be awaiting them. If they want to fly blind on their
own wings, it will not be long before they are deceived by lying
spirits, who will try to exploit their presumptuousness.
       217. Once the faculty has been developed, it is essential that
mediums not abuse it. The satisfaction that some beginners derive
from it elicits an enthusiasm that needs to be controlled. They must
bear in mind that it has been given to them for good use and not to
satisfy vain curiosity. Thus, it is essential that they only utilize it at
appropriate times and not at every instant. Spirits are not constantly
at their orders and they run the risk of being deceived by pranksters.
To avoid such impropriety it is advisable to set certain days and
hours aside for practicing mediumship so that one may be more
concentrated, and so that the spirits who want to communicate,
knowing about it in advance, will also be more disposed to be present.
       218. If, in spite of all attempts, mediumship does not surface
in some form, then it is best to give up on it, as a would-be singer
would give up after discovering he or she had no voice after all. In
the same way that someone who does not understand a foreign
language resorts to an interpreter, the person will have to resort
to another medium. But even if there is no medium available, we
should not deem ourselves to be without the assistance of spirits.
Mediumship is only one means for spirits to communicate, but
it is not the sole means of attraction. Those who have dedicated
their affection to us are with us whether or not we are mediums. A
father does not abandon his son because the son is deaf and blind
and can neither hear nor see him; on the contrary, he involves
himself even more in his care – good spirits do the same for us.
If they are unable to physically transmit their thought to us, they
help us with their inspiration.


                                   273

                            Chapter XVII


               Changes in Handwriting
       219. A very common phenomenon among writing
mediums is the change in handwriting according to the spirits
who communicate. The most notable example is that the same
handwriting always repeats itself with the same spirit, often
appearing identical to the handwriting it displayed during its
lifetime. We shall later observe the consequences that can arise
from this fact when we address identification. Such changes
only occur with mechanical or semi-mechanical mediums, since
their hand movement is involuntary and guided by the spirit.
The same does not apply to purely intuitive mediums, because
in their case the spirit only acts upon their thought and the
hand is guided by the medium’s own will as in ordinary writing.
But if there are no changes in the styles of the writing, even
with a mechanical medium, this proves nothing against his or
her faculty in and of itself. Such changes are not an absolute
condition in the manifestation of spirits, but result from a special
aptitude with which the most purely mechanical mediums are
not always gifted. We designate those who possess this gift as
polygraphic mediums.

  The Loss and Suspension of Mediumship
       220. The mediumistic faculty is subject to interruptions
and temporary suspensions both for physical manifestations and
written ones. Following is the response of the Spirits to a few
questions on the matter:
       1) Can mediums lose their faculty?
       “This frequently happens, whatever may be the type of
faculty. But it is nearly always nothing more than a temporary
interruption that ceases with the cause that has produced it.”

                                274

                    The Development of Mediums


       2) Would the exhaustion of fluid be the cause of the loss of
mediumship?
       “Whatever mediums’ ability may be, they have no ability
whatsoever without the sympathetic cooperation of spirits.
Whenever they do not receive anything, it is not always because
they lack the faculty, but frequently because spirits do not want –
or are even unable – to use them.”
       3) What causes spirits to abandon mediums?
       “The way in which they use their mediumship is what most
influences good spirits. We may abandon them when they use
it on futilities or for ambitious purposes, or when they refuse to
transmit our words or to collaborate in producing phenomena for
incarnates who beseech them or who need to see them in order to
be finally convinced. God does not bestow this gift upon mediums
for their own pleasure, even less for them to serve their ambitions;
rather, it is to serve their own progress and to make the truth
known to humankind. If spirits see that their mediums are no
longer in harmony with their purposes or do not take advantage
of the instructions and advice they give them, they withdraw and
seek out more worthy wards.”
       4) Can’t spirits who withdraw be replaced, and if so, how are
we to understand the suspension of the faculty?
       “Indeed, there is no lack of spirits who are especially
desirous to communicate and who are always ready to replace
those who withdraw. However, when those who have withdrawn
are good spirits, it is possible that they might have only
withdrawn temporarily, depriving such mediums for a time of all
communication so that they may learn a lesson and realize that
their faculty does not depend on themselves and therefore must
not be used for their own vanity. This temporary deprivation
has the further aim of proving to them that they write under
the influence of another; otherwise, they would not experience


                                275

                              Chapter XVII


interruptions. Moreover, the interruption of the faculty is not
always a punishment, but sometimes demonstrates spirits’ care for
the mediums toward whom they are affectionate, and to whom
they want to provide a respite when they deem it necessary. In that
case, they will not permit other spirits to replace them.”
       5) But morally speaking, there are mediums of great worth,
who do not feel any need for respite and become very distressed at the
interruption because they do not understand its purpose.
       “It serves to test their patience and to evaluate their
perseverance. That is why spirits generally do not set a time limit
on the suspension, because they want to see if their mediums
become disheartened. It is also often for the purpose of allowing
them time to meditate on the instructions that they have given
them. Through such meditation we recognize who the truly
serious Spiritists are. We cannot regard as such those who are
actually mere amateurs at communications.”
       6) Then is it necessary for mediums to continue attempting to write?
       “If their spirits so counsel, yes; if they have advised them to
abstain, they must obey.”
       7) Is there a way for them to shorten the test?
       “Yes, through resignation and prayer. At most, it is enough
to make an attempt daily for a few minutes, for it would be useless
to waste time on fruitless efforts. Such attempt only serves to verify
whether the faculty has returned.”
       8) Does the suspension imply the withdrawal of the spirits who
habitually communicate?
       “In no way. Such mediums find themselves in the situation
of persons who have temporarily lost their sight, but who have
not been abandoned by their friends, even though they cannot see
them. These mediums can and should continue to converse with
their familiar spirits through thought and persuade themselves
that they are indeed listened to. If the lack of mediumship can


                                   276

                        The Development of Mediums


deprive them of physical communications with certain spirits, it
does not deprive them of mental ones.”
       9) Then the interruption of the mediumistic faculty is not
always a rebuke by the spirits?
       “Of course not, since it can also be a demonstration of
benevolence.”
       10) How can we recognize if an interruption is a rebuke?
       “Interrogate your conscience and ask yourself what use you
have made of your faculty, what good others have derived from
it and what profit you have derived from the counsels that have been
given to you, and you will have your answer.”
       11) Can’t mediums who have lost their writing ability resort to
another medium?
       “That depends on the cause of the interruption. It is nearly
always a need to allow them some time without communications
after the counsels that have been given to them so that they do
not get used to doing everything only under our guidance. In
that case, they will not find what they are seeking with another
medium. This has a further purpose, which is to demonstrate the
independence of spirits, whom they cannot make act at their own
pleasure. This is also the reason why those who are not mediums
do not always obtain all the communications they desire.”
      In fact, we must observe that those who resort to a third party to obtain
      communications, notwithstanding the medium’s quality, often receive
      nothing satisfactory, whereas on other occasions, the responses are very
      explicit. It depends so much on the spirit’s will that everything will remain
      the same in spite of the medium. It seems that the spirits themselves obey
      a word of order in this case, because whatever cannot be gotten from one
      medium cannot be obtained any better from another. We should thus
      avoid insisting and being impatient, so that we do not become victims of
      deceiving spirits, who will respond if we ardently desire it, for good spirits
      will allow them to do so in order to punish our insistence.

       12) For what purpose has Providence endowed certain
individuals with special mediumistic abilities?
       “It is a mission they have been charged with and about
which they should feel fortunate: they are interpreters between
spirits and humankind.”
       13) But there are mediums who only reluctantly employ their
faculty.
       “They are imperfect mediums. They do not realize the value
of the grace that has been granted them.”
       14) If it is a mission, why doesn’t it represent the privilege of
moral individuals only, since it is also given to those who merit no
consideration and who may even abuse it?
       “Precisely because such individuals need it in order to
evolve, and so that they may have the possibility of receiving wise
teachings. If they do not take advantage of it, they will suffer the
consequences. Didn’t Jesus himself prefer to speak to sinners,
stating that it is necessary to give to those who are in need?”
       15) Couldn’t persons who have a great desire to write as mediums
but who do not manage it reach negative conclusions about themselves
with regards to the goodwill of the spirits toward them?
       “No, because God could have refused to grant them the faculty,
just as God could have refused them the gift of poetry or music;
however, if they do not enjoy this faculty, they can enjoy others.”
       16) How can humans perfect themselves through spirits’ teachings
when they do not have the possibility of receiving such teachings
directly, whether through themselves or through other mediums?
       “Don’t they have books, just as Christians have the Gospel?
In order to practice the morals of Jesus, Christians do not need to
hear the words straight from the Master’s own mouth.”

      Problems and Dangers
         of Mediumship
          • The Influence of the Practice of Mediumship
              on the Health, the Mind and Children



        221. 1) Is the mediumistic faculty an indication of some
pathological state or simply an abnormal one?
        “Sometimes abnormal, but not pathological. There are
vigorously healthy mediums; unwell ones are so for other reasons.”
        2) Can exercising the mediumistic faculty cause fatigue?
        “The prolonged exercise of any faculty produces fatigue.
The same happens with mediumship, especially the physical
effects types, which necessarily cause an expenditure of fluids. This
leads the medium to become fatigued, but his or her fluids will be
restored with rest.”
        3) Apart from cases of abuse, can exercising mediumship in and
of itself cause health problems?
        “There are times when it is prudent and even necessary
to abstain from or at least moderate the use of mediumship. It


                                 279

                            Chapter XVIII


depends on the physical and mental state of the medium, who
usually becomes aware of it. When the medium begins to feel
fatigued, it is time to stop.”
        4) Might exercising the faculty present more problems for one
individual than for another?
        “As I just said, it depends on the medium’s physical and
mental state. There are persons who should avoid any cause of
over-excitement, and the practice of mediumship would be one of
them.” (See nos. 188 and 194)
        5) Can mediumship produce insanity?
        “No more than anything else could when mental weakness
predisposes one to it. Mediumship will not produce insanity
where the germ of insanity does not already exist. But if it does,
it is easily recognized through the individual’s mental condition,
and common sense tells us that we must take all the precautions
necessary, for in such a case any disturbance would be harmful.”
        6) Could developing mediumship in children cause problems?
        “Certainly, and sustaining it could also be very dangerous,
because such fragile and delicate organisms would be very disturbed
and their infantile imaginations too over-excited. Thus, prudent
parents will keep these ideas away from them, or at least they will
speak to them regarding their possible consequences from the
mental point of view.”
        7) Nonetheless, there are children who are natural mediums,
whether of physical effects, writing or visions. Is the same danger
involved in these cases?
        “No. When the faculty manifests spontaneously in children,
it belongs to their nature and their constitution is adequate. The
same does not apply when mediumship is artificially caused and
induced. You may notice that children who have visions are usually
little concerned about them; visions seem very natural, so they pay
little attention to them and almost always forget about them. Later

                 Problems and Dangers of Mediumship


on, however, the remembrance returns and is easily explained if
they understand Spiritism.”
      8) At what age may mediumship be practiced without causing
problems?
      “There is no precise age limit. It depends entirely on
physical development and more particularly on psychological
development. There are children of twelve years who would be
less impressionable than some already-developed individuals.
I am referring to mediumship in general, since physical effects
mediumship is more fatiguing to the body. As for writing, there
is another problem in that children lack experience, and also they
may want to practice it alone or make a game of it.”
      222. As we shall soon see, the practice of Spiritism requires
much tact in order to undo the ruses of deceptive spirits. If
adults are deceived by them, children and youths are even more
exposed to them due to their inexperience. We also know that
meditation is an essential condition, without which we cannot
address serious spirits. Evocations made carelessly or for purposes
of entertainment comprise a true profanation, and as such they
open the door to mocking or malevolent spirits. Since we cannot
expect the necessary seriousness for such an act from children, we
should fear that if left to themselves they might transform it into
a game. Even under the most favorable conditions we must hope
that children gifted with mediumship will only exercise it under
the supervision of experienced individuals, who, through their
own example, will teach them the respect due to the souls of those
who used to be of this world. Therefore, we see that the problem
of age is subordinate both to the conditions of temperament
and character. Nevertheless, what the above responses clearly
emphasize is that we must not force the development of the
mediumistic faculty in children when it is not spontaneous,
and that in all cases it is necessary to utilize it only with great

                                281

                            Chapter XVIII


circumspection, and never elicit or encourage its practice by frail
individuals. We must use all available means to keep mediumistic
practice away from those who show the least sign of eccentricity
in their ideas or weakness in their mental faculties, for they are
obviously predisposed to insanity, which any over-exciting cause
may develop. In this respect, Spiritist ideas have no more influence
than others, but should insanity manifest itself, it will take on the
character of the dominant preoccupation just as it would take on a
religious character in persons who hand themselves over to excess
in devotional practices, but the responsibility would be attributed
to Spiritism. The best thing to do with any persons who display
a tendency toward an idée fixe is to steer their preoccupations in
another direction in order to provide rest to their weakened organs.
       In this matter, we would call the attention of our readers to
section XII of the Introduction to The Spirits’ Book.

        Spirit’s Dissertation on the Role of Mediums



      The Influence of the Medium’s Spirit
       223. 1) During the time in which they exercise their faculty,
are mediums in a perfectly normal state?
       “Sometimes they are in a state of crisis that is more defined
or less so. This is what fatigues them and why rest is necessary.
But most of the time their state is not otherwise than normal,
especially where writing mediums are involved.”
       2) Can written or verbal communications also come from the
medium’s own spirit?




                                283

                                Chapter XIX


         “The medium’s soul can communicate like any other. If
it enjoys a certain degree of liberty, it recovers its qualities as
a spirit. You have proof of this when you are visited by the
souls of living persons, who communicate with you through
writing, often without having been called. You should realize
that among the spirits you evoke there are those who are still
incarnated on the earth. In these instances, they speak with you
as spirits and not as human beings. Why couldn’t the medium’s
own spirit do the same?”
         – Doesn’t this explanation seem to confirm the opinion of those
who believe that all communications emanate from the medium’s own
spirit rather than from another?
         “They are mistaken in understanding that their opinion is
absolute. The medium’s spirit can certainly act on its own, but this
is no reason for other spirits not to be equally able to act through
the medium’s intermediation.”
         3) How can we tell if the spirit who responds is that of the
medium or if it is another spirit?
         “By the nature of the communication. Study the circumstances
and language and you will be able to tell. The medium’s spirit manifests
especially in the somnambulistic or ecstatic state because that is when
it is freest, but in the normal state it is more difficult. Moreover, there
are responses that could not possibly be attributed to the medium’s
own spirit. That is why I have told you to observe and study.”
       When persons are speaking to us, it is easy to distinguish between what
       actually originates from them and what they are only repeating. The
       same applies to spirits.

       4) Since the medium’s spirit could have acquired knowledge
in previous existences, which it has forgotten in its present body, but
which it remembers as a spirit, couldn’t it draw from deep inside itself
the ideas that seem to go beyond the reach of its present education?

                         The Identity of Spirits


        “This often happens in cases of somnambulistic or ecstatic
trance, but there are still circumstances that allow for no doubt –
study the matter in depth and meditate.”
        5) Are the communications of the medium’s own spirit always
inferior to those that may be attributed to other spirits?
        “Always, no, since the communicating spirit can be of a
lower order than that of the medium, in which case it will speak
less sensibly. This may be seen during somnambulism because that
is when the somnambulist’s spirit frequently manifests; however, it
will often give very good information nonetheless.”
        6) Does the communicating spirit transmit its thought directly
or does it use the medium’s incarnate spirit as an intermediary?
        “The medium’s spirit is the interpreter because it is
connected to the body which serves for the communication, and
because this link between you and the communicating spirits is
necessary, just as an electric wire is necessary for transmitting news
over a distance, and an intelligent person is necessary on either end
of the wire to receive and communicate.
        7) Does the medium’s spirit influence the communications that
it must transmit from other spirits?
        “Yes, because if there is no affinity between them, the
medium’s spirit could alter the responses by adapting them to its
own ideas and tendencies, but it does not exert any influence on the
communicating spirits themselves; it is merely a bad interpreter.”
        8) Is that why certain spirits prefer certain mediums?
        “There is no other reason. They look for the interpreter
who best sympathizes with them and transmits their thought most
precisely. If there is no sympathy between them, the medium’s
spirit will be antagonistic and will put up resistance, making
itself an unwilling and, almost always, unfaithful interpreter. You
yourselves experience the same thing when the ideas of a scholar
are transmitted by a foolish or dishonest person.”

                              Chapter XIX


       9) We can understand how this might be true of intuitive
mediums, but not when we are dealing with mechanical mediums.
       “You do not understand the medium’s role very well.
There is a law that still escapes you. Remember that in order
to produce the movement of an inert object the spirit requires
a portion of the medium’s animalized fluid, which it uses to
momentarily animate a table, for example making it obey
its will. Very well, for an intelligent communication it also
needs an intelligent intermediary, and this intermediary is the
medium’s spirit.”
       – This does not seem to apply to what we call ‘talking tables’,
because when they and other ‘inert objects’, such as planchettes and
baskets, respond intelligently, it appears that the medium’s spirit does
not participate in any way.
       “That is a mistake. A spirit can give momentary fictitious life
to an inert object, but not intelligence. An inert object has never
had intelligence. It is therefore the medium’s spirit who receives
the thought without realizing it and transmits it little by little with
the help of various intermediaries.”
       10) Do these explanations imply that the spirit of the medium
is never completely passive?
       “It is passive when it does not mix its own ideas with those
of the communicating spirit, but it is never completely nullified.
Its cooperation is indispensable as an intermediary, even in so-
called mechanical mediums.”
       11) Isn’t there a greater guarantee of independence in the
mechanical medium than in the intuitive medium?
       “Without a doubt, and for some communications a
mechanical medium is preferable. When we are familiar with the
faculties of a particular intuitive medium, however, and depending
on the circumstances, it does not matter. I mean that certain
communications require less precision.”

                           The Identity of Spirits


            The Theory of Inert Mediums
       12) Among the different theories proposed to explain spirit
phenomena, there is one that presumes that there is true mediumship
in inert objects; for example, in the basket or cardboard box that serves
as the instrument. The communicating spirit would identify itself
with the object and render it not only living but also intelligent, which
has given rise to the designation ‘inert mediums’ to such objects. What
is your opinion?
       “I only need to state the following: if the spirit were to
transmit intelligence to the box and give it life, the box would be
able to write by itself without the medium’s support. It would be
as strange for an intelligent person to become a machine as for an
inert object to become intelligent. This is one of the many theories
derived from preconceived ideas, and which will crumble in the
light of experience and observation.”
       13) A well-known phenomenon seems to make acceptable
the idea that there is in inert animated objects more than just life –
perhaps even intelligence. It is the phenomenon of tables, baskets, etc.
expressing anger or affection in their movements.
       “When an angry man shakes a stick, it is not the stick that
is angry or even the hand that is holding it, but rather the thought
that directs the hand. Tables and baskets are no more intelligent
than a stick. They have no intelligent sentiment but obey an
intelligence. In other words, a spirit neither transforms itself into
a basket nor chooses to dwell in it.”
       14) If it is unreasonable to attribute intelligence to these objects,
could we nevertheless regard them as a variety of medium and designate
them as ‘inert mediums’?
       “That is a matter of words, which mean little to us, provided
you yourselves understand what you mean by them. You are free
to call a puppet a man.


                                    287

                             Chapter XIX


        The Aptitude of Certain Mediums
         for Things They Do Not Know:
         Languages, Music, Drawing, etc.
       15) Spirits only have the language of thought, not articulated
speech; therefore, they use only one language. Thus, a spirit could
express itself mediumistically in a language it had never spoken when
incarnate. In this case, where does it get the words it uses?
       “You already answered this question by yourself when you
said that spirits only have one language, which is that of thought.
Everyone understands this language – both humans and spirits.
When addressing the incarnate spirit of the medium, the discarnate
spirit does not speak in French or English, but in the universal
language of thought. In order to translate its ideas into articulated,
transmissible language, it utilizes the vocabulary of the medium.”
       16) If that is so, spirits would only express themselves in the
medium’s language, but we know that they write in languages that are
unknown to the medium. Isn’t that a contradiction?
       “First, you should realize that not all mediums are equally
adept at this type of exercise. Second, spirits only lend themselves
to it occasionally when they deem it to be useful. For normal,
lengthy communications they prefer to use a language that is
familiar to the medium because it presents them with fewer
material difficulties to overcome.”
       17) Doesn’t the ability of certain mediums to write in a foreign
language prove the fact that they had spoken it in another lifetime and
have intuitively retained it in the present one?
       “That could certainly be the case, but it is not the rule. With
some effort, a spirit can temporarily overcome material resistance,
which can be verified when mediums write in their own language
using words unknown to them.”


                                 288

                           The Identity of Spirits


      18) Could a person who does not even know how to write do so
as a medium?
      “Yes, but you must understand that there is a great
mechanical difficulty to overcome, because the hand is not used
to the movements required to form letters. The same applies to
painting mediums, who do not know how to draw.”
      19) Could a medium of very low intelligence transmit
communications of an elevated order?
      “Yes, for the same reason that a medium can write in
an unknown language. Mediumship per se does not depend
on intelligence or moral qualities. In the absence of a better
instrument, a spirit can use whatever one is at hand. However, for
communications of a certain order it is natural that it will prefer the
medium who offers it the fewest material obstacles. There is a further
consideration: mentally impaired individuals are only so because
of the imperfection of their brain, since their spirit may be more
advanced than one might think. You have proof of this through
some evocations of living and dead mentally impaired persons.”
      This is a fact borne out by experience. Many times we have evoked
      the spirits of living mentally impaired individuals, who provided patent
      proof of their identity and answered us in a very sane and even superior
      manner. Their impaired state is a punishment for the spirit, who suffers
      because of the constraint under which it finds itself. Mentally impaired
      mediums can thus sometimes offer a spirit who wants to manifest greater
      resources than one might think. (See Revue Spirite, July 1860, article on
      Phrénologie and on Physiognomonie).

       20) How can we explain the aptitude of certain mediums to
write in verse in spite of their poetic ignorance?
       “Poetry is a language in itself. They can write in verse, just
as they could write in an unknown language. Furthermore, they
could have been poets in a previous existence. As I have already


                                    289

                             Chapter XIX


stated, acquired knowledge is never lost by spirits, who must reach
perfection in all areas. Thus, without their realizing it, what they
knew in the past provides them an ease that they do not possess in
the normal state.”
       21) Does the same apply to those who display a special aptitude
for drawing and music?
       “Yes. Drawing and music are also forms for expressing
thought and spirits use instruments that offer them the most ease.”
       22) Does the expression of thought through poetry, drawing or
music depend solely on the aptitude of the medium or also on that of
the communicating spirit?
       “Sometimes, the medium; sometimes, the spirit. Highly
evolved spirits possess all aptitudes, whereas less evolved ones have
limited knowledge.”
       23) Why do individuals who were gifted with a great talent in
one existence not possess it in the next one?
       “That is not always the case, for often such individuals
perfect in one existence what they had begun in the previous
one. Nonetheless, it could be that a superior faculty lies
dormant for a certain amount of time in order to facilitate the
development of another. It will be a latent seed that will later
germinate again, but there will always be some visible signs of
it or at least a vague intuition.”
       224. Undoubtedly, a communicating spirit understands
all languages because they are forms for expressing thought, and
the spirit understands through thought. In order to transmit this
thought, however, it requires an instrument – the medium. The
medium’s soul, who receives the spirit’s communication, can only
transmit it through the bodily organs; thus, for transmitting in an
unknown language, these organs do not have the flexibility they
possess for the familiar language. A medium who only knows how
to speak in French could accidentally give a response in English,

                                 290

                         The Identity of Spirits


for example, if the spirit so wills. However, spirits, who find
human language already too slow in comparison to the speed of
thought – and therefore they try to abbreviate a language as much
as possible – become impatient with the mechanical resistance of
the transmission, and that is why they do not always attempt it.
This is also the reason why novice mediums, who write painfully
and slowly even in their own language, usually only receive brief
responses that are not fully developed. This is also why spirits
recommend that only simple questions be asked by such novices.
For farther reaching questions, a developed medium is required,
who offers no mechanical resistance to the spirit. We would not
choose a student who was just learning to spell to read a text for
us. A good worker does not like to use low quality instruments.
      Let us add another highly important consideration
regarding foreign languages. Endeavors in this area are always
done out of curiosity with the purpose of experimentation, and
nothing is more unpleasant to spirits than the proofs to which
some individuals try to submit them. Highly evolved spirits never
lend themselves to this and they depart from those who intend
to enter onto such a path. They love serious and useful subjects
as much as they loathe concerning themselves with useless and
purposeless ones. Disbelievers will say that this is nevertheless a
useful aim for convincing them in that it could result in winning
adherents for the cause of the Spirits. In response the Spirits state:
“Our cause does not need those who are so proud as to deem
themselves indispensable. We call to ourselves those whom we want
and who are always the humblest and most unassuming. Did Jesus
perform wonders for the scribes when they asked him to? And
what kind of individuals did he use to revolutionize the world?
If you want to convince yourselves, you have other means than
through demands. Start by submitting yourselves to the facts: it is
not normal for students to impose their will upon their master.”


                                  291

                             Chapter XIX


       The result of this is that, except for a few exceptions,
mediums transmit spirits’ thoughts through the available
mechanical means, and the expression of this thought could
and should be often affected by the imperfection of such means.
Thus, uncultured individuals will say the most beautiful things
and express the most elevated and philosophical thoughts in an
uncultured manner, for as we know, for spirits the thought means
more than everything else. This answers the objections of certain
critics as to incorrectness of style and spelling, which they would
blame the spirits for, but which could be attributed to either the
mediums themselves or the spirits. It is not worthwhile to dwell
on such matters, and it is no less childish to want to point out
such incorrectness with minute precision, as we have sometimes
witnessed. We should correct it without any scruples unless it is
characteristic of the communicating spirit, in which case it will be
useful to retain as proof of identity. Hence, for example, we have
seen a spirit always write Jule (lacking the ‘s’) when referring to its
grandson because during its lifetime, it wrote it like that, although
the grandson, who served as its medium, knew perfectly well how
to spell his own name.

A Spirit’s Dissertation on the Role of Mediums
      225. The following dissertation, given spontaneously by
a high order spirit who revealed itself through highly sublime
communications, clearly and completely summarizes the issue of
the medium’s role:
      “Whatever may be the nature of writing mediums, whether
mechanical, semi-mechanical or simply intuitive, our procedures
for communicating through them do not vary essentially. Actually,
our communications with incarnate spirits, as well as spirits per se,
occur solely by the radiation of our thought.


                                 292

                         The Identity of Spirits


       “Our thoughts do not have to be clothed in words in order
for spirits to understand them. All spirits perceive the thought that
we want to transmit to them by the simple fact that we direct it to
them, and this according to the degree of their intellectual faculties.
This means that a specific thought can be comprehended by some,
according to their respective advancement, whereas for others the
same thought will not be perceptible, as it awakens no memory or
understanding in the depths of their hearts or minds. In such a case,
the incarnate spirit, who acts as our medium, is more appropriate
for transmitting our thought to other incarnates – even though it
does not understand the thought – something a discarnate but less
evolved spirit could not do if we depended on its mediation. This
is because the earth-bound being gives its body as an instrument at
our disposal, which the discarnate spirit cannot do.
       “Thus, whenever we find mediums whose minds are full
of knowledge acquired during their present lifetime, and whose
spirits are rich in previously-acquired, latent knowledge proper
for facilitating our communications, we will prefer to employ
them, for then the phenomenon of the communication will be
much easier for us than through mediums of limited intelligence
and whose previously-acquired knowledge is insufficient. We will
try to make ourselves better understood through some clear and
precise explanations.
       “With mediums whose current or previously-acquired
intelligence is developed, our thought is communicated instantly,
spirit to spirit, through a faculty inherent in the essence of the
spirit itself. In this case, we find the appropriate elements in these
mediums’ minds for clothing our thought with the corresponding
words, whether these mediums are intuitive, semi-mechanical or
entirely mechanical. That is why that in spite of several spirits
communicating through the same medium, the data received
from them always bears the personal stamp of the medium both


                                  293

                              Chapter XIX


in form and style, because although the thought is not exclusively
the medium’s own, or the topic is not part of his or her customary
concerns, and even though what we want to say does not derive
from him or her in any way, the medium does not cease to exert a
personal influence on the form by giving it individualized qualities
and properties. It is precisely like when you look at several places
through tinted lenses – green, white, or blue. Although the places
and objects are entirely different and totally independent from one
another, they nonetheless always appear with the coloration given
to them by the various lenses. A better example: let us compare
mediums to those glass bottles that are filled with colored and
transparent liquids and that may be seen in drugstores. Well
then, we are like luminous focal points shining on certain moral,
philosophical and psychological inner scenes, illuminating them
through blue, green or red mediums in such a way that our luminous
rays take on their colorations. In other words, our rays must pass
through glass that varies in degrees of cut and transparency, which
means mediums with different degrees of intelligence. Our rays
only reach those objects that we want to illuminate by taking on
the coloration or personal style of these mediums. Finally, to finish
with one more comparison: we spirits are like musical composers
who have composed or would like to improvise on an air and have
only one of these instruments at our disposal: a piano, a violin, a
flute, bassoon or a ten-cent whistle. There is no doubt that with the
piano, the flute or the violin, we will play our piece satisfactorily to
our listeners. Even though the sound of the piano, bassoon or flute
is each essentially different for each instrument, our composition
will always be the same one in spite of the differences in sound.
However, if we only have the ten-cent whistle at our disposal, we
would run into difficulties.
       “In fact, when we have to use little-advanced mediums,
our work becomes slower and tedious because we must resort to


                                  294

                        The Identity of Spirits


incomplete forms of expression, which is an impediment to us.
We are then forced to break down our thoughts and dictate word
by word, letter by letter, which is tiring and fatiguing to us, and
comprises a real restraint on the promptness and development of
our manifestations.
       “That is why we feel fortunate to find mediums well prepared,
sufficiently equipped and furnished with mental elements that can
be quickly utilized; in other words, good instruments, for then our
perispirit, acting upon the perispirit of whomever we mediumize,
only has to give impulse to the hand, which serves as a pen or
pencil holder. With badly equipped mediums, we are obliged to
perform a work similar to when we have to communicate by means
of raps, that is, letter by letter, word by word in order to form the
sentences that translate the thought to be transmitted.
       “This is the reason why we prefer enlightened and educated
classes of individuals to divulge Spiritism and develop writing
mediumship, although in such classes we also encounter the most
incredulous, rebellious and morally depraved individuals. It is also
the reason why if nowadays we allow little-advanced spirits to
transmit tangible communications through raps and apportations,
the least serious persons among you also prefer phenomena
that touch their eyes and ears to those of a purely spiritual and
psychological nature.
       “Whenever we want to dictate spontaneous messages, we
act upon the mind, the mediums’ archives, and we join our own
material with the elements they provide us – all without them
realizing it. It is as if we took the money from their pockets and
arranged the coins in the order that seemed best to us.
       “However, whenever mediums themselves want to question
us through whatever means, it would be good for them to reflect
seriously beforehand in order to ask us questions methodically,
making our work of responding easier, because according to what


                                 295

                             Chapter XIX


was stated in a previous instruction, your minds are frequently
in inextricable disorder, making it difficult and tedious to move
about in the maze of your thoughts. Whenever questions must be
asked through a third party, it would be a good and appropriate
idea to communicate them beforehand to the medium so that he
or she may identify with the spirit to be questioned, becoming
impregnated (so to speak) with its thoughts, for then we will
find it much easier to respond thanks to the affinity between our
perispirit and that of the medium who is to serve as our interpreter.
       “Of course, we can discuss mathematics through a medium
that is completely unfamiliar with the subject, but almost always
the spirit of the medium possesses such knowledge in a latent state;
that is, knowledge that is personal to the fluidic being and not to
the incarnate being, since the current body is an inadequate or
rebellious instrument for this type of knowledge. The same applies
to astronomy, poetry, medicine and various languages, and with
all the other knowledge peculiar to the human species. Finally, we
still have the tedious task of preparation applied to mediums that
are completely unfamiliar with the subject under consideration,
which is that of putting the letters and words together as is done
in typesetting.
       “As we have already stated, spirits do not need to clothe their
thoughts in words. They perceive and transmit them naturally
amongst themselves. Incarnate beings, on the contrary, can only
communicate through thought translated into words. While letters,
words, nouns, verbs and sentences are required for your perception,
even mentally, no visible or tangible form is required for us.”
                                               Erastus and Timothy

      This analysis of the role of mediums and the processes
through which they communicate is both clear and logical. From
it we may derive the principle that a spirit does not utilize the


                                 296

                          The Identity of Spirits


ideas of the medium, but rather the necessary materials present in
the medium’s mind for expressing its own thoughts, and that the
richer the mind, the easier the communication becomes. When a
spirit expresses itself in a language familiar to the medium, it finds
the words already formed and ready for the translation of its ideas.
If it communicates in a foreign language, it does not have words
at its disposal but only letters. It is then that the spirit is obligated
to dictate letter by letter, exactly as if we wanted to make a person
who did not know even a word of it to write in German. If the
medium did not know how to read or write, not even letters would
be at the spirit’s disposal. Then, the spirit must guide the hand
as one would do with a child. In such a case there is a material
difficulty that is even harder to overcome. These phenomena are
possible and we have numerous examples of them. However, it
should be understood that this manner of proceeding does not
lend itself to lengthy and rapid communications, for which spirits
must prefer the easiest instruments possible, or, as they themselves
have said, well-equipped mediums from their point of view.
        If those who request such phenomena in order to be
convinced had attempted to study the theory first, they would
know about the special conditions under which they are produced.

            • Various Questions • A Spirit’s Dissertation
                    concerning Moral Influence



                      Various Questions
       226. 1) Does the development of mediumship have any relation
to the medium’s moral development?
       “No. The faculty per se is organic and therefore independent
of morality. However, the same does not apply concerning its use,
which can be good or bad according to the medium’s character.”
       2) It has always been said that mediumship is a gift from God, a
grace, a divine favor. Then, why isn’t it a privilege of moral individuals
only? And why are there unworthy persons who are endowed with it to
the highest degree but who use it badly?
       “All our faculties are favors for which we should thank God,
for there are some persons who do not possess them. You could
just as well ask why God has given good eyesight to criminals,
dexterity to thieves, or eloquence to those who only use it for evil.

                                   299

                              Chapter XX


The same applies to mediumship: unworthy individuals have been
endowed with it because they need it more than others in order
to better themselves. Do you think that God refuses the means of
salvation to the guilty? Instead, he multiplies such means at every
step by placing them right in their hands. It is their responsibility to
take advantage of them, however. Didn’t the traitor Judas perform
wonders and cure diseases as a disciple? God provided him with
this gift so that he might afterwards see more clearly the odiousness
of his betrayal.
       3) Will mediums who put their faculties to bad use, who do not
utilize them for the good, or who do not take advantage of them for
their own education suffer the consequences?
       “If they put them to bad use, they will be doubly punished
since they will have lost the opportunity to profit from a way of
enlightening themselves. A person who sees clearly and stumbles
anyway is more culpable than someone who is blind and falls
into a ditch.”
       4) There are mediums who quite often receive spontaneous
communications that are about the same subject, addressing certain
moral questions, for example, related to certain defects. Is there some
purpose for this?
       “Yes, and the purpose is to enlighten them concerning a
constantly-repeated subject or to correct them of certain defects.
This is why spirits always speak to some about pride and others
about charity, for only persistence will finally succeed in opening
their eyes. There are no mediums who misuse their ability out of
ambition or self-interest, or who disgrace it with some essential
defect such as selfishness, pride or frivolousness, who do not
time and again receive warnings from spirits. Most of the time,
unfortunately, they do not apply such warnings to themselves.
       Spirits nearly always give their lessons in a reserved indirect
way in order to allow for greater merit to those who know how


                                  300

                       The Medium’s Moral Influence


to apply and take advantage of them. However, some persons are
so blind and proud that they do not recognize themselves in the
picture they have right in front of them. Furthermore, if a spirit
gives them to understand that they themselves are the subject of
the lesson, they become angry and call the spirit a liar or a joker –
enough to prove that the spirit is correct.
       5) When they receive general lessons with no personal
application, don’t mediums act as passive instruments to serve for the
instruction of others?
       “Almost always such warnings and advice are not directed
toward them, but to others whom we can only reach through their
mediumship. Nonetheless, mediums should try to profit from
them themselves unless they are blinded with vanity.
      “Don’t think that mediumship is given only to correct one or two
      individuals; rather, the objective is greater: it is meant for all humankind.
      As individuals, mediums are very unimportant instruments. Thus, when
      we provide instructions of general interest, we utilize mediums who
      offer us the required abilities, but you can be very sure that the time will
      come when good mediums will be quite common and good spirits will
      no longer have to use faulty instruments.”

       6) If a medium’s moral qualities repel less evolved spirits, why
do mediums gifted with good qualities transmit erroneous or even crass
responses?
       “Do you know all the secrets of their soul? Besides, without
being nasty they can be irresponsible and frivolous instead, and
they could also be in need of a lesson in order to warn them.”
       7) Why do highly evolved spirits allow persons who are gifted
with great mediumship abilities, and who could do a great deal of
good, to become instruments of error?
       “Such spirits try to influence them, but when these
individuals allow themselves to be drawn onto a path of error, they


                                      301

                                 Chapter XX


do not stop them. That is why they use them so reluctantly, for the
truth cannot be interpreted with a lie.”
       8) Is it completely impossible to receive good communications
through an imperfect medium?
       “Imperfect mediums can sometimes obtain good
communications since, if they have a good faculty, good spirits can
use them in the absence of better ones in special circumstances.
They do so only temporarily, however, because when they find
others who would serve them better, they prefer them.”
       We should point out that when good spirits see that certain mediums
       cease to be good instruments, and due to their imperfections, start
       to become prey to deceptive spirits, they nearly always bring about
       circumstances that reveal their defects and they keep them away from
       serious, well-intentioned persons, whose good faith might be abused by
       them. In such cases, whatever their faculties may be, there is nothing to
       be sorry about.

       9) What are the qualities of mediums whom we could regard
as perfect?
       “Perfect? Alas! You know very well that there is no perfection
on the face of the earth. If such were not so, you would not be
there. Thus, we say ‘good’ mediums, instead, and that is saying
much, for they are rare indeed. Perfect mediums would be those
whom evil spirits would never dare to try to deceive. However, the
best ones are those who are attuned solely to good spirits, and who
allow themselves to be deceived the least.”
       10) If they are attuned solely to good spirits, why do these spirits
allow them to be deceived?
       “Good spirits allow the best mediums to be deceived
sometimes so that they can exercise their judgment and learn
to discern truth from falsehood. Besides, no matter how good
mediums may be, they are never so perfect that they do not have


                                     302

                     The Medium’s Moral Influence


a weak side that can expose them to being attacked. Such should
serve them as a lesson. The erroneous communications they
receive from time to time are warnings for them to avoid deeming
themselves infallible and becoming proud, because mediums who
receive the most noteworthy communications cannot be any more
proud of themselves than an organ-grinder, who only has to turn
the crank in order to produce beautiful tunes.”
       11) What conditions are necessary so that the word of highly
evolved spirits comes to us without any alteration?
       “Desire only what is good and avoid selfishness and pride:
both conditions are necessary.”
       12) If the word of high order spirits cannot come to us in its
purest form except under such difficult conditions, isn’t it an obstacle
to spreading the truth?
       “No. The light always comes to those who desire to receive
it. Those who desire enlightenment must run from darkness, and
darkness is to be found in the impurity of the heart.
       “Spirits whom you consider as personifications of morality
do not willingly answer those who have a heart stained with pride,
greed and a lack of charity.
       “Therefore, let those who desire enlightenment free
themselves of all human vanity and humble their reason before
the infinite power of the Creator. This will be the best proof of
their sincerity; all are able to fulfill this condition.”
      227. Even though mediums are merely instruments with
regards to execution, they nevertheless exert a large moral influence
because communicating spirits identify with the medium’s spirit,
and for this identification there must be sympathy between them –
we might even say an affinity. The soul exerts a kind of attraction
or repulsion upon the communicating spirit according to the
degree of similarity or dissimilarity between them. Thus, good
souls have affinity with good spirits, and bad souls have affinity

                                  303

                              Chapter XX


with bad spirits, from which it follows that the moral qualities of
mediums have a capital influence upon the nature of the spirits
who communicate through their intermediation. If mediums are
morally lacking, less evolved spirits huddle around them and are
always ready to take the place of the good spirits the mediums try to
contact. The qualities that attract the preference of good spirits are:
goodness, benevolence, simplicity of heart, love for one’s neighbor
and detachment from material things. The defects that repel them
are: pride, selfishness, envy, jealousy, hate, greed, sensuality and all
the passions that keep humans attached to matter.
       228. All moral imperfections are open doors for evil spirits,
but the one they most easily exploit is pride because pride is the
one that people least often confess about themselves. Pride has
led to the loss of many mediums gifted with the most beautiful
faculties and who, without pride, would have been remarkable
and highly useful instruments. As they became prey to deceiving
spirits, their faculties were at first twisted and then destroyed, and
many saw themselves humiliated by the bitterest disappointments.
       Pride expresses itself in mediums through unmistakable signs
that must be brought to light, for it is one of the elements that must
arouse distrust concerning the veracity of their communications.
It starts with a blind confidence in the superiority of the
communications and in the infallibility of the spirit who transmits
them. This causes a certain disdain for everything that does not
proceed from only them, since they deem themselves privileged
with the truth. The prestige of the great names, with which spirits
who say that they are their protectors adorn themselves, dazzles
them, and since their vanity would suffer if they had to confess
that they had been duped, they reject every type of counsel and
even avoid it altogether, shunning friends and anyone else who
might possibly be able to open their eyes. Even if they were
to agree to listen to such persons, they would not assign any

                                  304

                    The Medium’s Moral Influence


importance to their warnings, for to doubt the superiority of their
guiding spirit would almost be blasphemy. They are upset by the
least disagreement, by the slightest critical observation, and they
sometimes end up by even hating the persons who have tried to
be of help to them. Due to the isolation caused by the spirits, who
do not wish to be contradicted, these same spirits do everything
they can to entertain these mediums’ delusions by leading them to
naively regard the most absurd matters as being sublime. Therefore,
blind trust in the superiority of the communications they receive,
disdain for those that do not come through their intermediation,
unreflective regard for grand names, rejection of counsel, distrust
of any criticism, avoidance of those who can provide disinterested
opinions and confidence in their own skill despite their lack of
experience – these are the characteristics of proud mediums.
       We must remember that pride is almost always aroused in
mediums by those who surround them. If they are endowed with
slightly transcendental abilities, they are sought out and praised,
and they end up deeming themselves to be indispensable. Soon,
they put on airs of importance and disdain when they lend their
services. We have more than once lamented the praise heaped on
some mediums with the intention of encouraging them.
       229. On the other side of the coin, let us emphasize
the picture of mediums who are truly moral, in whom we can
trust completely. First, let us suppose an ease of performance
sufficiently great to enable spirits to communicate freely without
the burden of any material difficulty. Having done so, the most
important thing to consider is the nature of the spirits who
customarily assist them, and for this we must pay more attention
to their language than the names they assume. They must never
forget that the affinity gained among good spirits will always
be in proportion to the efforts they make to repel the evil ones.
Convinced that their ability is a gift that has been granted to

                                305

                            Chapter XX


them for good purposes, they will never take advantage of it or
attribute any merit to themselves for possessing it. They accept
the good communications received as a blessing, and they should
put forth every effort to render themselves worthy of them
through goodness, benevolence and modesty. The former group
of mediums pride themselves in their relations with so-called
superior spirits; the latter humble themselves by always regarding
themselves as unworthy of such a favor.

        A Spirit’s Dissertation concerning
                  Moral Influence
       230. The following instruction on the subject was given
to us by a Spirit whose many communications we have already
reproduced:
       “As I have already said: mediums in and of themselves exert
a secondary influence in spirit communications. Their role is
like that of an electric telegraph machine transmitting dispatches
between two distant places on the earth. Thus, when we want
to dictate a message, we act upon the medium like a telegraph
operator acts upon the apparatus; i.e. in the same way that the
tick-tack of the telegraph will trace the reproduced signals of the
dispatch upon a strip of paper thousands of miles away, we also
communicate what we want to teach you across the immeasurable
distances that separate the visible and invisible, the immaterial
and incarnate worlds, by means of a mediumistic apparatus.
However, just as atmospheric conditions often act upon and
disturb telegraphic transmissions, the medium’s moral influence
sometimes acts upon and disturbs the transmission of our
dispatches from beyond the grave, for we are then obliged to send
them through an environment which opposes them. Most of the


                               306

                    The Medium’s Moral Influence


time, though, this influence is nevertheless nullified by our energy
and will, and no disturbance occurs. As a matter of fact, dictations
of elevated philosophical reach and communications of perfect
morality are sometimes transmitted through mediums who seem
hardly appropriate for such superior instructions, whereas, on the
other hand, communications that are hardly edifying sometimes
arrive through mediums who are ashamed of having served to
transmit them.
       “We may affirm, as a general rule, that similar spirits
attract each other, and that groups of highly evolved spirits rarely
communicate through bad conductors when they have good
mediumistic apparatuses at their disposal; in other words, good
mediums.
       “Frivolous, little-serious mediums therefore summon
spirits of the same nature and that is why their communications
are characterized by banality, frivolousness, truncated ideas,
and are nearly always very heterodoxical, spiritually speaking.
Of course, they can and sometimes do say good things, but it
is precisely in such cases that one must submit them to a severe
and scrupulous examination, because in the midst of good things,
certain hypocritical spirits skillfully and calculatedly insinuate
imagined facts and lying assertions for the purpose of deceiving
good faith listeners. Every equivocal word and sentence must then
be eliminated without mercy, retaining only what logic approves
or what the Doctrine has already taught. Communications of this
nature only threaten isolated Spiritists and recently-formed or
unenlightened groups, because in meetings of more advanced and
experienced adherents it is futile for the crow to adorn itself with
peacock feathers since it will always be mercilessly exposed.
       “I will not speak of mediums who enjoy soliciting and
receiving obscene communications. Leave them to take pleasure in
the fellowship of cynical spirits. Besides, communications of this


                                307

                            Chapter XX


type require solitude and isolation. In any case, they could never
provoke anything but disdain and repugnance among members
of philosophical and serious groups. However, where mediums’
moral influence truly makes itself felt is when they substitute
their own personal ideas for those that spirits attempt to suggest
through them, and it is felt even more when they draw delusional
theories from their own imaginations, which they naively deem to
have resulted from an intuitive communication. In this case, there
are a thousand chances to one that it represents nothing more than
a reflection of their own personal spirit. A curious occurrence is
when the medium’s hand sometimes moves mechanically under the
impulsion of a secondary or mocking spirit. This is the touch-stone
against which ardent imaginations fall because led by the ardor
of their own ideas and by the artifice of their literary knowledge,
these mediums despise the modest dictation of a wise spirit, and
forsaking the prey to hunt the shadow, they replace it with puffed
up paraphrase. Another pitfall that these ambitious personalities
fall prey to is when, in the absence of the communications that
good spirits refuse them, they present their own works as having
come from them. Thus, it is necessary that the leaders of groups
be gifted with refined tact and rare sagacity in order to discern
authentic communications from those which are not, and at the
same time not harm those mediums who have allowed themselves
to be deluded.
       “‘When in doubt, abstain’, states one of your ancient
proverbs. Thus, accept only what is backed by indisputable
evidence. Whenever a new opinion appears that seems the least bit
doubtful, pass it through the sieve of reason and logic. Whatever
reason and common sense reprove, fearlessly reject it. It is better
to reject ten truths than to accept one single lie. In fact, upon
that one erroneous theory you could build an entire system, which
would crumble under the first breath of truth like a monument


                               308

                    The Medium’s Moral Influence


constructed on quicksand, whereas if you reject certain truths
today because they are not clear or logical to you, a shocking fact
or an irrefutable demonstration will soon come to you to affirm
their authenticity.
       “Nonetheless, O Spiritists, remember that nothing is
impossible for God and for good spirits, except injustice and
inequality.
       “Spiritism has already spread extensively among humankind
and has already sufficiently moralized the sincere followers of its
Doctrine, so that the Spirits no longer feel obligated to utilize bad
instruments or imperfect mediums. Now if mediums, whoever
they may be, become the object of suspicion due to their conduct,
their habits, their pride, or their lack of love and charity, reject
their communications – there is a serpent hiding in the grass. Thus
is my conclusion concerning the moral influence of mediums.”

         The Influence of the
           Surroundings
        231. 1) Do the surroundings in which mediums work exert
any influence on the manifestations?
        “All the spirits who surround mediums help them either for
good or evil.
        2) Can’t high order spirits overcome the ill will of incarnate
spirits who serve as their interpreters, and also overcome the ill will of
other spirits around them?
        “Yes, whenever they deem it useful to do so, and according
to the intent of the person who addresses them. We have already
said: highly evolved spirits can sometimes communicate to provide
special assistance despite the imperfection of the medium and
the surroundings, but then they remain completely outside such
surroundings.”
        3) Do high order spirits attempt to bring frivolous meetings
back to the field of more serious ideas?
        “High order spirits do not attend meetings in which
their presence would be futile. However, they willingly go to
surroundings where there has been little instruction, but where

                                   311

                             Chapter XXI


there is true sincerity even if they only find deficient instruments
there; however, they do not go to intellectual environments in
which sarcasm reigns. In such cases, it is necessary to impact eyes
and ears – the role of rapping and mocking spirits. It is fitting that
those who pride themselves on their knowledge be humiliated by
spirits who are less knowledgeable and less advanced.”
       4) Are low order spirits forbidden from taking part in serious
meetings?
       “No. Sometimes they are present at them in order to take
advantage of the teachings that you receive, but they keep quiet
like ignorant listeners during a meeting of scholars.”
       232. It would be erroneous to believe it necessary to be a
medium in order to attract the beings of the invisible world. They
are everywhere; they are constantly around us, next to us; they
watch and observe us, interfere in our meetings, and follow or
avoid us, depending on whether we attract or repel them. The
mediumistic faculty does not have any influence upon this; rather,
it is simply a means of communication. According to what we
have seen concerning the causes of sympathy and antipathy among
spirits, we can easily understand that we are surrounded by those
who have an affinity with our own spirit, that is, according to
our advancement. If we would further consider the moral state
of our globe, we would comprehend what kinds of spirits must
predominate among discarnate spirits. If we were to regard each
nation in particular, we would be able to discern which orders of
spirits would be found in it by the dominant character of its citizens
and the degree of their moral and humanitarian preoccupations
and sentiments.
       Using this as a starting point, let us imagine a meeting
of frivolous and inconsequential individuals, who are solely
interested in their own pleasures. What kinds of spirits would
prefer to be amongst them? Surely not highly evolved ones, since

                                 312

                   The Influence of the Surroundings


our own scholars and philosophers would not waste any of their
time in such places. Hence, every time persons meet together there
is amongst them a concealed assembly of spirits, who sympathize
either with their good qualities or imperfections – aside from all
thoughts of evocation. Now let us suppose that there is a possibility
for these persons to communicate with beings from the invisible
world through an interpreter, that is, a medium. Which spirits will
respond to their call? Obviously, the ones who are already there,
who are looking for nothing more than a favorable opportunity.
If a high order spirit were evoked during a frivolous meeting, it
might answer and even utter some sensible words like a good
shepherd who comes to his wandering sheep. However, if it sees
that it is being neither understood nor listened to, it will leave – as
you would do it in its place – and the other spirits will have the
field free for themselves.
       233. A serious meeting is therefore not always sufficient
for receiving elevated communications. There are individuals who
never smile and yet their hearts could not be purer. More than
anything else, it is the heart that attracts good spirits. No moral
condition impedes spirit communications per se, but if our moral
conditions are bad, we will communicate with those who are
similar to us, who will not waste the opportunity to deceive us and
who will almost always stimulate our prejudices.
       We can thus see the enormous influence of the surroundings
upon the nature of intelligent manifestations. However, this
influence does not exert itself as some persons formerly thought it
did when the spirit world was still unknown – unlike nowadays –
and before the most decisive experiences had cleared up doubts
about it. When the communications agree with the way that the
participants normally see things, it is not because their opinions
have been reflected in the spirit of the medium like in a mirror,
but because the spirits are sympathetic with them, whether for

                                 313

                            Chapter XXI


good or evil, and share in the same opinions. This is proven by the
fact that if they could attract other spirits to communicate with
them instead of those who customarily surround them, the same
mediums would speak in much different styles and would say
things quite removed from their normal opinions and convictions.
       In sum, the conditions of the surroundings will be better as
there is greater moral homogeneity for the good, purer and more
elevated sentiments, and a more sincere desire to learn without
preconceived ideas.

    Mediumship in Animals
       234. Can animals be mediums? This question has been
frequently proposed, and certain facts appear to indicate an
affirmative response. What have especially given a reason for
accepting such a possibility are the noteworthy indications of
intelligence in certain trained birds, which seem to guess people’s
thought in drawing from a pack of cards the ones corresponding
precisely to the question posed. We have observed such experiments
with special care, and what we have admired most is the skill that
had to be developed in order to teach the birds in the first place.
       We cannot deny that they possess a small dose of relative
intelligence, and we must agree that in the circumstances alluded
to, their perspicacity might surpass that of many humans because
few persons could boast about being able to do what these birds
do. It might even be necessary in a few cases to imagine that they
possess a gift of second sight superior to that of the most lucid
somnambulists. We know that lucidity is in fact essentially variable
and is subject to frequent intermittences, whereas amongst these
birds it appears to be permanent and functions with a regularity
and precision that could never be found in any somnambulist. In
other words, they would never lack it.


                                315

                             Chapter XXII


       Most of the experiments that we have witnessed resemble
those practiced by stage magicians, and we cannot help but doubt
the means employed, particularly the way the cards are prepared.
The art of stage magic consists in disguising the sleight-of-hand,
without which the desired effect would not be achieved. However,
even when the phenomenon of the birds is reduced to such
proportions, it is no less interesting, because we would nevertheless
have to admire both the talent of the trainer and the intelligence of
the student since the difficulties to overcome are much greater than
if the bird could only act by employing its own faculties. Managing
to enable the bird to do things that exceed the limits of what is
possible for human intelligence proves, by its very nature, the use
of some secret process. Moreover, it is indisputable that the birds
only acquired such a degree of skill after some time of special and
persevering care, which would not be necessary if their natural
intelligence had been sufficient to produce the same results. It is
no more extraordinary to train them to pull cards from a deck than
to accustom them to singing or repeating certain words. The same
applies when a stage magician wants to imitate second sight: he or
she takes the individual, who is under his or her influence, to the
extreme so that the illusion may be more lasting. Ever since the first
time we watched a session of that kind, we have seen nothing more
than a very imperfect imitation of somnambulism, which revealed
an ignorance of the most essential conditions of that faculty.
      235. In any case, the above experiments leave the principal
question intact, for even though somnambulism can be imitated,
that does not negate the actual existence of the faculty, and the
imitation of mediumship in the birds proves nothing against the
possibility of a similar faculty in them or in other animals. Therefore,
what we must determine is whether or not animals are as capable
as humans to serve as intermediaries for spirits and their intelligent
communications. It would at first seem logical to suppose that a

                                  316

                        Mediumship in Animals


living being that is gifted with a certain degree of intelligence would
be more appropriate for such effects than an inert, lifeless object – a
table, for example. However, such is not the case.

        A Spirit’s Dissertation on the Issue
       236. The issue of mediumship in animals is fully resolved
in the following dissertation given by one of the Spirits, whose
profundity and sagacity may be appreciated in the many quotations
that we have already cited. To better appreciate the value of his
comments, it is essential that we recall his previous explanation in
no. 225 above concerning the role of mediums in the transmission
of communications.
       The following communication was given at the Parisian
Society for Spiritist Studies following a discussion on the matter.
       “Today I shall address the issue of mediumship in animals,
which has been brought up and argued by one of your most avid
members. In virtue of the maxim ‘the one who can do the most can
do the least’, he believes that we should be able to mediumize birds
and other animals, using them to communicate with the human
species. It is what you call in philosophy, and more particularly
in logic, purely and simply a sophism. He has said, ‘Since spirits
can animalize inert matter such as a table, a chair or a piano, they
should with more reason be able to animalize already-animated
matter, especially birds’. Nevertheless, this is not and cannot be the
case within the normal laws of Spiritism.
       “First, let us consider things for a moment. What is a
medium? A medium is the individual being who serves as an
intermediary for spirits so that they can easily communicate with
humans, i.e., incarnate spirits. Therefore, without a medium, there
can be no tangible, mental, written, physical or any other type of
communication.


                                 317

                              Chapter XXII


        “There is a principle that I am sure all Spiritists accept:
similars act through similars and like their similars. Well, what
are the similars of spirits if not incarnate or discarnate spirits? Is it
necessary to repeat this incessantly? Well then, I will repeat it again:
your and our perispirits are drawn from the same environment;
they are of an identical nature; in a word, they are similars. They
both possess a capacity of assimilation that is more developed
or less so, and of magnetization that is more vigorous or less so,
which enable us, discarnate and incarnate spirits, very quickly and
easily to establish a connection. Thus, what pertains specifically
to mediums, to the very essence of their individuality, is a special
affinity, and at the same time a special power of expansion that
suppresses in them every possibility of rejection, establishing
between them and us a kind of current or fusion that facilitates
our communications. It is ultimately this possibility of rejection,
proper to matter, which opposes the development of mediumship
in most of those who are not mediums.
        “People are always eager to exaggerate everything. Some
(and I do not mean materialists) deny that animals even have
a soul, while others want to see them as possessing one that is
similar to ours. Why would they want to confuse the perfectible
with the imperfectible? No, no, be assured of this: the fire that
animates animals, the breath that enables them to act, move and
speak in their own language does not at present have any ability
to mix, unite or merge with the divine breath, the ethereal soul,
the spirit; in short, that which animates the essentially perfectible
being: the human being, ruler of all terrestrial creatures. Now, isn’t
it this essential condition of perfectibility that endows the human
species with superiority over all other earthly species? Thus, you
should realize that there can be no individuals of any other species
living on the earth that are similar to human beings, who alone are
perfectible in themselves and in their works.

                        Mediumship in Animals


       “Can the dog, whose intelligence is great amongst the
animals, and who has become humankind’s friend and companion,
perfect itself through its own initiative? No one would dare affirm
such to be the case, for dogs do not enable other dogs to progress,
and the most well-trained among them have all been trained by
their owner. For hundreds of thousands of years beavers have
constructed their lodge upon the water, always with the same
proportions and according to an invariable system; nightingales
and swallows have never built their nests differently than their
ancestors did. A sparrow’s nest before the Flood would have been
the same as a sparrow’s nest nowadays, made under the same
conditions and by the same system of interweaving grasses and
sticks gathered in springtime, the season of love. Bees and ants
in their little organized republics have never varied their habits
of gathering provisions, their way of behaving, their customs and
their productions. Finally, spiders have always weaved their web
in the same way.
       “On the other hand, if you search for the leaf huts and
tents of humankind’s early ages, you will find that they have
been replaced by the castles and palaces of modern civilization.
Garments of animal skin have been succeeded by fabrics of gold
and silk. Finally, at every step you will discover proof of the
unceasing forward march of humankind’s progress.
       “From this constant, invincible and undeniable progress
of the human species, and from the indefinite standstill of the
other animated species, you will conclude with me that there are
principles common to everything that lives and moves on the face
of the earth: breath and matter, and it is no less true that only you,
as incarnate spirits, are subject to that inevitable law of progress
that fatalistically impels you always onward and forward. God
has placed the animals at your side as auxiliaries to feed, clothe
and aid you. God has given them a small degree of intelligence,


                                 319

                             Chapter XXII


because, in order to help you, they must understand you, and God
has conditioned this intelligence to the services they must render.
However, in the divine wisdom God did not will for them to be
subject to the law of progress in the same way. That is how they
were created; that is how they have remained and shall remain
until the extinction of their species.
       “It used to be said: spirits mediumize and cause inert matter
to move – chairs, tables and pianos. Cause to move, yes; mediumize,
no! Once more: without a medium, none of these phenomena are
produced. What is so extraordinary about the fact that we can
cause inert, passive matter to move with the help of one or several
mediums is precisely because matter per se is inert and passive and
can be enabled to obey the movements and impulses with which
we want to endow it. It is obvious that we need mediums in order
to do this, but mediums do not have to be immediately present
or conscious, since we can act with the elements they furnish
us without their knowledge or presence, especially when the
phenomena of tangibility and apportations are involved. In our
fluidic envelope, which is more imponderable and subtler than
the subtlest and most imponderable of your gases, the joining,
combining with and blending of the medium’s more animalized
fluidic envelope, whose properties of expansion and penetrability
escape your coarse senses and is nearly inexplicable to you, enables
us to move furniture and even break it in empty rooms.
       “Certainly, spirits can make themselves visible and tangible
to animals, and it often happens that a sudden fright grabs hold
of them, which seems unreasonable to you, but is caused by their
seeing one or several such spirits, who have bad intentions with
regards to the individuals present or the animals’ owner. Quite
often, horses are seen refusing to advance or retreat, or rearing
before some invisible obstacle. Well, you can be certain that that
invisible obstacle is almost always a spirit or group of spirits having


                                 320

                        Mediumship in Animals


fun in deterring them. Remember Balaam’s ass, which upon seeing
an angel and fearing its flaming sword, did not want to go any
further. It was because before it visibly appeared to Balaam, the
angel only wanted to make itself visible to the animal. I will repeat,
however, we do not directly mediumize animals or inert matter.
We always need the conscious or unconscious participation of a
human medium because we need a joining of similar fluids, which
we cannot find in animals or plain matter.
       “They say that Mr. T. magnetized his dog. What was the
result? He killed it. The unfortunate animal died after having
fallen into a kind of lifelessness or languor as a result of having
been magnetized. In effect, infusing the dog with the absorbing
fluid of an essence superior to the special essence of its own nature,
the owner killed it by producing an action upon it similar to
lightning, though much slower. Thus, since there is no possibility
of assimilation between our perispirit and the fluidic envelope
of animals per se, we would immediately kill them if we tried to
mediumize them.
       “Having established this point, I perfectly recognize
the existence of diverse aptitudes among animals; that certain
feelings and passions identical to human feelings and passions
develop in them; that they are sensitive and grateful, vengeful
and rancorous, according to the good or bad treatment they
receive. God, in doing nothing incompletely, has given domestic
animals – humankind’s companions and servants – the qualities
of sociability that are completely lacking in animals that live in
the wild. However, between that fact and their ability to serve as
intermediaries for the transmission of spirits’ thoughts there is an
abyss: the difference of natures.
       “You know that we draw from the medium’s brain the elements
required to give our thought a form that is sensible and perceptible
to you, and that it is with the help of his or her own materials


                                 321

                           Chapter XXII


that the medium translates our thought into common language.
Very well, what elements would we find in the brain of an animal?
Would there be words, letters and certain symbols similar to those
that we find in even the least intelligent human? Nevertheless, you
will say that animals comprehend human thought and can even
divine it. Yes, trained animals comprehend certain thoughts, but
have you ever happened to see them reproduce them? No. Thus,
we must conclude that animals cannot serve as interpreters.
       “To summarize: mediumistic phenomena cannot be
produced without the conscious or unconscious participation
of mediums, and it is only among incarnates, who are spirits as
we are, that we find those who can serve us as mediums. As for
teaching dogs, birds and other animals to perform this or that
service, that is your business and not ours.”

       The September 1861 issue of Revue Spirite provides detailed
explanations concerning a process used by trainers of learned
birds, which enables the birds to draw from a deck of cards the
ones requested – Auth.

       237. Of all the difficulties presented in the practice of
Spiritism, among the worst we must place obsession, which is
the domination that certain spirits may acquire over certain
individuals. This domination is always the work of little-evolved
spirits, for good ones never exert any kind of coercion whatsoever;
instead, they provide counsel and fight against the influence of evil
spirits, and whenever they are not listened to, they prefer simply
to withdraw. Evil ones, on the other hand, latch onto whomever
they can control. If they manage to dominate someone, they
identify with the victim’s spirit, leading the person as if he or she
were a child.
       Obsession displays many characteristics which we must
distinguish precisely, and which result from the degree of
coercion and the nature of the effects it produces. Thus, the
word obsession is a generic term used to designate this kind
of phenomenon, whose main varieties are: simple obsession,
fascination and subjugation.


                                323

                            Chapter XXIII


                     Simple Obsession
       238. Simple obsession occurs when malevolent spirits impose
themselves upon mediums, interfere against their will in the
communications they receive, impede them from communicating
with other spirits and substitute themselves for those who are evoked.
       No mediums are obsessed by the simple fact of being
deceived by a lying spirit, because the best mediums are subject
to deception, especially in the beginning when they still lack
experience, just as among us the most honest individuals may be
deceived by swindlers. Hence, one may be deceived without being
obsessed. Instead, obsession consists in the tenacity of a spirit,
from which the victim cannot break free.
       In simple obsession, mediums know perfectly well that they
are dealing with a deceptive spirit, who does not in any way disguise
or cloak its evil intentions and its desire to cause trouble. These
mediums easily recognize the deceit, and since they are on the alert,
they are rarely fooled. Thus, this form of obsession is only unpleasant
and only has the inconvenience of making communications difficult
with serious spirits or those we are fond of.
       We can include in this category cases of physical obsession,
which consist in noisy and obstinate manifestations of certain
spirits, who spontaneously produce raps and other sounds.
Concerning this phenomenon, we refer the reader back to the
chapter, Spontaneous Physical Manifestations (no. 82).

                          Fascination
       239. Fascination has much more serious consequences. It
refers to a delusion created directly by a spirit in the thought of a
medium, which in a certain manner paralyzes his or her capacity
to judge the quality of the communications. Fascinated mediums

                                 324

                              Obsession


do not believe themselves to be deceived. These spirits manage
to inspire them with a blind confidence that prevents them from
realizing the deception and comprehending the absurdity of
what they write, even when it jumps out at the eyes of everyone
else. The delusion can reach the point to where it causes them
to consider the most ridiculous language as sublime. Those who
think that this type of obsession can only touch simple, ignorant
and senseless persons are mistaken. The most refined, educated
and otherwise intelligent individuals are not at all exempt from this
kind of delusion, which proves that we are addressing an aberration
produced by an outside cause, whose influence dominates them.
       We have stated that the consequences of fascination are very
serious. What happens is that, thanks to the delusion that results
from it, these spirits guide the victims whom they have managed
to dominate as if they were blind, and they can lead them to accept
the most absurd doctrines and erroneous theories as being the sole
expression of truth. Moreover, they can incite them to foolish,
compromising and even dangerous acts.
       One can easily and fully comprehend the difference between
simple obsession and fascination. One can also understand that
the spirits who produce these two types must differ from each
other in character. In the former, spirits who attach themselves to
mediums only inconvenience them by their tenacity, from which
the mediums try to break free. It is much different in the latter,
for in order to achieve their purposes such spirits must be skillful,
cunning and deeply hypocritical, since they can only succeed
at being deceptive if they impose themselves by wearing a mask
and putting on a false appearance of virtue. Grand words such as
charity, humility and love for God serve as their calling card, but
through it all shine signs of how little-evolved they are – which
only those who are fascinated cannot perceive. That is why these
spirits dread, more than anything else, persons who see things


                                325

                             Chapter XXIII


clearly. Their tactic is nearly always that of inspiring their mediums
to avoid whoever might open their eyes; thus, by avoiding any
contradiction, they are always certain to be in the right.

                          Subjugation
       240. Subjugation is a constriction that causes its victims’
will to become paralyzed, making them act in spite of themselves.
In other words, they find themselves under true bondage.
       Subjugation can be either mental or physical. In the former,
those who are subjugated are led to make frequently absurd and
compromising decisions, which, under a kind of delusion, they
regard as sane – it is a type of fascination. In the latter, the spirit
acts upon the physical organs to produce involuntary movements.
In writing mediums, it produces an incessant need to write, even at
inopportune times. We have seen subjugated mediums who, in the
absence of a pen or pencil, pretended to write with their finger and
they could even be seen on the street, writing on doors and walls.
       Corporeal subjugation sometimes goes so far as to lead the
medium to commit the most ridiculous acts. We knew of a man,
neither young nor handsome, who was dominated by an obsession of
this nature. He was coerced by an irresistible force to fall on his knees
before a young woman in whom he had no interest and to ask her to
marry him. At other times he felt a strong pressure in his back and
in the curves of his legs that, in spite of his resistance, caused him to
kneel and kiss the earth in public places in the midst of a crowd. He
was regarded as crazy by those who knew him, but we are absolutely
convinced that he was not, for he was fully conscious of the ridiculous
things he did against his will – he suffered from it terribly.
      241. Formerly, the dominion exerted by evil spirits was
called possession, when their influence reached the point of


                                  326

                             Obsession


producing an aberration of the human faculties. For us, possession
would be synonymous with subjugation. However, we have not
adopted the term possession for two reasons: first, it implies a
belief in the existence of beings who were created for evil and
forever turned to it, whereas in reality there are only beings who
are at different stages of imperfection and who are susceptible
to improving themselves; second, it also implies the idea of the
body being taken over by a foreign spirit, a kind of cohabitation,
whereas there is actually only coercion. The word subjugation
expresses the idea perfectly. Thus, for us there are no possessed
individuals in the ordinary sense of the word, but only obsessed,
fascinated and subjugated ones.

                  Causes of Obsession
       242. As we have said, obsession is one of the greatest
obstacles of mediumship, and it is also one of the most frequent.
Hence, every effort should be taken to combat it, especially, since
apart from the personal harm resulting from it, it comprises an
absolute obstacle to the purity and veracity of communications.
Since obsession to any degree is always the result of coercion,
and since such coercion can never be exerted by a good spirit,
it follows that every communication given through an obsessed
medium is of suspected origin and merits no confidence at all.
If per chance something good may be found in it, it is necessary
to keep it and reject everything else that displays the least reason
for doubt.
      243. Obsession is recognized by the following characteristics:
      1) A spirit’s insistence on communicating, whether or not
the medium desires it, through writing, audition, typtology, etc.,
and its opposition to all other spirits to do so.


                                327

                            Chapter XXIII


      2) The illusion is such that, in spite of the intelligence of the
medium, it prevents him or her from recognizing the falseness and
ridiculousness of the communications received.
      3) A belief in the infallibility and indisputable identity of
the spirits who communicate, and who state lies and absurdities
under respectable and venerated names.
      4) The medium’s acceptance of praise from the spirits who
communicate through his or her intermediation.
      5) A propensity for avoiding those who could provide
enlightenment about the situation.
      6) Offence taken at criticisms of the communications
received.
      7) An incessant and inopportune need to write.
      8) Any form of physical coercion that dominates the will
and forces one to act or speak without wanting to.
      9) Continuous noises and disturbances around the medium
that are either caused by the medium him or herself, or that have
the medium as their target.
       244. In light of the danger of obsession, the question arises
as to whether it is not actually regrettable to be a medium at
all and whether mediumship itself provokes obsession; in other
words, whether this is not evidence of the inappropriateness of
spirit communications. Our response is simple, and we ask that it
be pondered with care.
       Since it was neither mediums nor Spiritists who created
spirits, but rather it was the spirits who gave origin to Spiritists
and mediums, and since spirits are simply human souls, it is
obvious that spirits have existed as long as humans have, and that
they have always exerted their beneficial or harmful influence on
humankind. The mediumistic faculty is for them only a way to
manifest themselves, and in the absence of this faculty they do
so in a thousand other ways that are more concealed or less so.

                              Obsession


Therefore, it would be erroneous to believe that spirits only exert
their influence through written or verbal communications. Their
influence is on-going, and those who do not concern themselves
with spirits, or who do not even believe they exist, are nonetheless
exposed to it like everyone else – even more so, by not having any
means of defense at their disposal. It is through mediumship that
a spirit makes itself known. If it is evil, it always betrays itself no
matter how hypocritical it may be. We can therefore state that
mediumship enables men and women to meet their enemies
face to face (if we may so express ourselves), and combat them
with their own weapons. Without this faculty, evil spirits act in
the shadows, and counting on their invisibility, they truly do
much harm. Through how many acts are not men and women
urged to their disgrace, which could have been avoided if they
had had a way of enlightening themselves! Disbelievers do not
realize how right they are when they speak of someone who
persists in error: “His evil spirit drives him to his loss.” Thus, far
from making the domination by evil spirits easier, knowledge of
spiritism should have as its result – in the not-too-far-off future
and after its promulgation – the destruction of such domination by
giving everyone the means of being on guard against these spirits’
suggestions. Then, those who succumb to them will only have
themselves to complain about.
       A general rule applies: those who receive evil written or
verbal spirit communications are under an evil influence, and this
influence imposes itself on them whether they write or not; that
is, regardless of whether they are mediums or believers. Writing
offers them a way to be certain as to the nature of the spirits who
act upon them and a way to combat them if they are evil, which is
more successfully accomplished when they understand the motives
behind their writing. If their blindness is such that it does not
allow them to understand, others will be able to open their eyes.

                            Chapter XXIII


       To summarize: the danger is not in Spiritism, since, on
the contrary, we can use it to control and save ourselves from the
constant risk to which we expose ourselves without realizing it.
The danger is, instead, in the propensity of certain proud mediums
who light-heartedly regard themselves as exclusive instruments of
highly evolved spirits, and in the kind of fascination that does not
allow them to comprehend the idiocies they interpret. However,
even those who are not mediums may fall into the same trap. Let
us make a comparison. A certain man has a secret enemy, of whom
he is unaware, and who, unbeknownst to him, spreads slander and
everything of the vilest nature that he can engender. The man
loses his fortune; his friends avoid him and his inner happiness is
completely upset. Since he cannot discover the hand that is injuring
him, he cannot defend himself and ends up defeated. However,
one day the secret enemy writes to him and betrays his identity in
spite of his cunning. Having found out who his enemy is, the man
can now expose him and recover his reputation. Such is the role
of evil spirits, whom Spiritism provides us with the possibility of
discovering and outsmarting.
       245. The motives behind obsession vary according to the
character of the spirits. At times it entails revenge against persons
who wronged them during their present life or in a previous
one. Quite often it is simply the desire to do evil since because
they suffer, they wish to make others suffer too, feeling a kind of
pleasure in tormenting and humiliating them. The impatience of
their victims also excites them because they then accomplish their
objective; however, if their victims are patient, they tire of the
game. If their victims become irritated and show their anger, they
do exactly what they want them to do. Sometimes such spirits act
out of hatred and jealousy toward whatever is good; that is why
they cast their malevolence over honest individuals. One of these
spirits attached itself like a true limpet to a good family of our

                                330

                               Obsession


acquaintance, which it did not, however, have the satisfaction of
deceiving. When questioned as to the motive for its attack against
such good folk instead of latching onto individuals like itself, it
responded: they do not give me anything to be envious of. Others are
driven by sheer cowardice, taking advantage of the mental weakness
of certain persons whom they know to be incapable of offering
any resistance. One of these, who subjugated a boy of rather low
intelligence, responded to us concerning the reason for its choice: I
feel a real need to torment someone: a sensible person would repel me; I
have attached myself to a lamebrain, who cannot resist.
       246. There are obsessing spirits who are not evil, who are
even quite good, but are dominated by the pride of false wisdom:
they have their opinions and their own theories about the sciences,
social economics, morality, religion and philosophy. They wish to
impose their opinion, and to do so they seek out mediums that are
sufficiently credulous to accept them with closed eyes, fascinating
them to the degree that they can no longer distinguish between
truth and falsehood. These are the most dangerous, for they do
not vacillate in their sophistry and can impose the most ridiculous
utopian ideas. Since they are fully knowledgeable of the prestige of
famous names, they have no scruples about impersonating them
and do not even balk before the sacrilege of calling themselves Jesus,
the Virgin Mary or some venerated saint. They try to delude their
victims by using pompous language that is more pretentious than
profound, full of technical terms and highlighted with grandiose
words such as charity and morality. They avoid giving evil counsels
because they know that they would be rejected; hence, those whom
they deceive always defend them, affirming: You can see very well
that they have said nothing evil. However, for such spirits, morality
is merely a passport – it is the least of their concerns. What they
want more than anything else is to dominate and impose their
ideas no matter how truly absurd they are.

                                  331

                            Chapter XXIII


        247. Theorizing spirits are nearly always scribblers, which
is why they seek out mediums who write easily, attempting to
make them their tamed and, especially, enthusiastic instruments
through fascination. Such spirits are generally verbose and very
prolix, seeking to make up for a lack of quality through quantity.
They take pleasure in dictating to their interpreters voluminous,
indigestible and, very often, barely intelligible writings, which
fortunately have as a side effect the material impossibility of being
read by the masses. Truly high order spirits are frugal with words,
saying much in only a few lines – prodigious fecundity should
always be regarded with suspicion.
        One can never be too prudent when dealing with the
publication of such writings. The utopian ideas and eccentricities
that usually abound in them, and which violate common sense,
elicit a very disagreeable impression in the novices who are taken
in by them, giving them an erroneous idea about Spiritism. They
also serve as weapons for adversaries to ridicule it. Among such
publications are those that, without being evil and without being
characterized as obsession, can nevertheless be considered as
imprudent, untimely, and incompetent.
      248. It frequently happens that a certain medium can only
communicate with one particular spirit, who connects itself with
him or her and responds on behalf of other spirits. This does
not always represent an obsession, since it may result from such
a medium’s lack of flexibility and from a special affinity on his
or her part with this or that spirit. Obsession per se only exists
when a spirit imposes itself and willingly drives others away, which
is never done by a good spirit. Normally, spirits who latch onto
mediums in order to dominate them do not bear up under a critical
examination of their communications. When they see that such
communications are not blindly accepted but are submitted to
discussion, they do not leave their mediums; instead, they suggest

                                332

                               Obsession


the thought to them that they should avoid others – and quite
often they order them to do so. All mediums who feel offended
at criticisms of their communications are in fact echoing the
spirit dominating them, and such a spirit cannot be good, since
it inspires them with the illogical thought of rejecting scrutiny. It
is always harmful to mediums to isolate themselves because there
is no control mechanism for their communications. They should
not only receive clarification from third parties, but should also
study all the forms of communication in order to compare them.
By limiting themselves to those they receive, no matter how good
they may seem, they remain exposed to being deceived as to their
true value. They should also consider the fact that they cannot
know everything, and that they always go round and round within
the same circle of ideas. (See no. 192, Exclusive Mediums)

          Means of Combating Obsession
       249. The means of combating obsession vary depending on
the characteristics in which it appears. There is no real danger for all
mediums who are good and convinced that they are dealing with a
deceiving spirit, which is the case in simple obsession. It is nothing
more to them than a disagreeable situation; however, precisely by
being disagreeable, such spirits have one more reason to persecute
their victims in order to humiliate them. Two essential measures
must be taken by mediums in such a case: prove to the spirit that
they have not been fooled by it, and that it is impossible that they will
allow themselves to be fooled; second, tire its patience by showing it
that they have more patience than it has. When it is convinced that
it is wasting its time, it will end up withdrawing, just as in the case
of importune individuals when no one will listen to them.
       Nonetheless, this is not always enough and such spirits can
linger for a long time – there are some who are so tenacious that


                                  333

                            Chapter XXIII


months and years mean little to them. Furthermore, mediums
must fervently appeal to their guardian angel and the good spirits
with whom they have affinity, praying for their assistance. As for
the obsessing spirit, no matter how evil it may be, it is necessary to
deal with it strictly but at the same time benevolently, overcoming
it with goodness and praying for it. If it is a truly wicked spirit,
it will at first laugh at all this, but perseveringly submitted to a
process of moralization, it will end up emending itself. It is a
conversion to be undertaken, an often painful, difficult task, but
whose merit is in its very difficulty, and when it has been well
performed, it always brings the satisfaction of having fulfilled a
duty of charity, and frequently of having brought a lost soul back
to the path of goodness.
       It is also worthwhile to suspend written communications
when we realize that they proceed from an evil spirit who does
not want to see reason in order not to give it the pleasure of
being heard. In certain cases, it may even be worthwhile to stop
writing altogether for some time, depending on the particular
circumstances. However, if writing mediums can thus avoid such
conversations by abstaining from writing, the same cannot be said
of hearing mediums, whom obsessing spirits sometimes persecute
at every instant with gross and obscene blathering, and who do not
have the option of plugging their ears. Moreover, we must realize
that certain individuals are actually entertained by the trivial
language of this type of spirit – who encourages and provokes
them to laugh at its silliness – rather than imposing silence upon
it and guiding it morally. Our counsels cannot be applied to those
who want to drown themselves.
      250. Therefore, in simple obsession there is only annoyance
and no real danger to all mediums who do not allow themselves to
be deceived, since they cannot be misled. However, precisely the
opposite occurs with fascination, for then the domination of these

                                 334

                              Obsession


spirits over their victims is limitless. The only thing to do is to
convince their victims that they have been deceived, and to regress
their obsession to the degree of simple obsession. This is not always
easy and is sometimes impossible. The ascendancy of such spirits
over their victims is such that it makes them deaf to all reasoning,
and they can even reach the point of doubting the judgments of
science when such spirits commit some blatant scientific heresy.
As we have already stated, those who are fascinated normally do
not take advice very well. Criticism upsets and irritates them, and
they intensely dislike those who do not share in their admiration.
To suspect their obsessor is almost blasphemy to them, which is
exactly what the spirit wants: to make them kneel before its words.
       One of these spirits exerted an extraordinary fascination
over a person of our acquaintance. We evoked it, and after some
boastfulness and seeing that it could not fool us as to its identity,
it confessed that it had assumed a false name. We asked it why
it had been abusing this individual so much, and it responded
with these words, which clearly reveal the character of this kind
of spirit: “I looked for a man I could handle; I have found him and
I shall remain with him.” “But if we enlighten him about you, he
will make you go away.” “Well, we’ll just see about that!” Since there
is no one as blind as those who do not want to see, then when
we realize the futility of all attempts to open the eyes of those
who are fascinated, it is best to simply leave them alone with their
delusions. We cannot heal those who, being ill, persist in their
illness and find comfort in it.
      251. Corporeal subjugation almost always deprives those
who are obsessed of the energies needed for them to gain control
over the evil spirit. This is why the intervention of third persons is
required, who act through magnetism or through the force of their
own will. When those who are obsessed do not cooperate, then these
persons must gain ascendancy over the spirit themselves. However,

                                 335

                            Chapter XXIII


since this ascendancy can only be moral, it can be exercised only
by persons who are morally superior to the spirit, and their power
will be in proportion to such moral superiority because then they
can impose themselves on the spirit, who is obligated to submit to
them. That is why Jesus had such great power to expel what were
at the time called demons, that is, evil obsessor spirits.
       At this point, we can only offer some general advice,
since there is no physical process or formula or, especially, any
sacramental word, which has the power to expel obsessing spirits.
What is sometimes lacking in those who are obsessed is sufficient
fluidic power. In this case, the magnetic action of a good magnetizer
can provide them with effective help. Moreover, it is always a good
idea to obtain, through trustworthy mediums, the counsels of a
high order spirit or their guardian angel.
       252. The moral imperfections of those who are obsessed are
frequently an obstacle to their liberation. Following is a noteworthy
example that may serve as a bit of instruction for everybody.
       For several years, a group of sisters had been the victims of
very unpleasant acts of depredation. Their clothes were constantly
being scattered throughout the house, even in the ceiling, and
were shredded, cut and poked full of holes no matter how careful
the sisters were in keeping them locked up. Since these ladies were
isolated in a small provincial town, they had never even heard of
Spiritism. The first idea to occur to them was naturally to believe
that they were being victimized by pranksters, but the incidents
persisted and the precautions they took led them to give up
on that idea. Only after quite some time, and thanks to a few
references, they were directed to us to try to determine the cause of
the disturbances, and if there was any possible remedy for putting
an end to them. The cause was obvious, but the remedy was very
difficult. The spirit who was manifesting itself was obviously
malevolent. Upon being evoked, it displayed great perversity and

                                336

                              Obsession


was inaccessible to good sentiments. However, prayer seemed to
exert a good influence on it, but after a short break the depredations
began once again. A high order spirit then provided this advice:
       “The best thing for these ladies to do is to pray to their
protector spirits not to abandon them, and I have no better advice
to give them than to delve into their own consciences and come to
terms with themselves as to whether they have always practiced love
and charity toward their neighbor. I do not mean the kind of charity
that is doled out, but charity of speech, because, unfortunately,
they do not know how to hold their tongues, and therefore they
do not justify their desire to be free of their tormentor by pious
acts. They truly love to speak ill of their neighbor, and the spirit
who is obsessing them is taking his revenge, for during his life
he had been a scapegoat for them. They only need to probe their
memory and they will soon discover whom they are dealing with.
       “However, if they resolve to mend their ways, their guardian
angels will return to them, and their presence alone will be sufficient
to drive off the evil spirit, who has attached itself to one of them
in particular because her guardian angel has withdrawn from her
due to her reprehensible acts and her evil thoughts. They must pray
fervently for those who suffer, and above all they must practice the
virtues that God recommends to all according to their situation.”
       Upon commenting that these words seemed to us to be a
bit severe and that perhaps they should be toned down before
transmitting them, the spirit added:
       “I must say what I must say, because these ladies are
accustomed to believing that they are doing no harm with their
tongue, when in fact they are doing great harm. Thus, it has been
necessary for this spirit to shock them in such a way as to serve as
a warning.”
       This resulted in a far-reaching instruction in affirming that
moral imperfections may give access to obsessor spirits, and that


                                 337

                            Chapter XXIII


the surest way of getting rid of them is to attract good spirits
through moral deeds. Good spirits are naturally more powerful
than evil ones, and their will is sufficient to repel them, but they
only answer those who help themselves by making efforts to
improve. Otherwise, they stay away and leave the field free for
evil spirits, who thus become instruments of punishment – good
spirits allow them to act for this purpose.
      253. However, we must avoid attributing to the direct
action of spirits all our troubles, which are usually the result of
our own carelessness and lack of foresight. A farmer once wrote
to us that for twelve years all sorts of mishaps had befallen his
animals. His cows had either died or no longer gave milk, and his
horses, sheep and pigs had died. He had offered many novenas,
which had not remedied the problem, nor had the masses he
attended or the exorcisms he ordered. Thus, he believed according
to farm superstition that his animals had been the target of a spell.
Deeming us unquestionably to possess greater power to conjure
than the priest of his village, he asked us for advice. Here is the
response we received:
      “The death or sickness of this man’s animals stems from his
infected stables, which he has not cleaned because it would cost
too much.”
       254. We shall close this chapter with the Spirits’ responses
to a few other questions that will support what we have stated:
       1) Why can’t certain mediums free themselves from evil spirits
who attach to them, and why don’t the good spirits whom they call
upon have enough power to drive the others away and communicate
through their intermediation?
       “Good spirits do not lack the power; rather, the mediums
are almost never in any position to help them. Their nature is
more adequate for other relationships, and their fluid identifies


                                338

                                 Obsession


more with one spirit than another. This is what gives such power
to the spirits who want to deceive them.
        2) However, it seems to us that there are truly deserving
individuals, who are morally irreprehensible, but who are nevertheless
prevented from communicating with good spirits.
        “It is a trial. Who knows if they might not have a stain of
evil on their heart? If a little pride does not hide behind their
appearance of goodness? Such trials reveal to the obsessed their
weakness and that they should strive to be more humble.
        “Is there anyone on the whole earth whom you can call
perfect? Those who seem to possess all the appearances of virtue can
still have many secret defects, an old leaven of imperfection. Thus,
for example, you say that some particular man does not practice any
evil, that he is loyal in all his social relationships, and that he is a good
and worthy individual. But how do you know that those qualities are
not stained with pride? That there is not some trace of selfishness in
him? That he is not greedy, jealous, resentful, slanderous and many
other things that you do not perceive, since your relationship with
him gives you no opportunity to discover them? The most powerful
means of combating the influence of evil spirits is to approach the
nature of the good ones as much as possible.”
        3) Is the obsession that prevents mediums from receiving the
communications they desire always a sign of their unworthiness?
        “I did not say that it is a sign of unworthiness, but that
there can be obstacles to certain communications. They must
endeavor to overcome such obstacles, which are to be found within
themselves. If they do not, their prayers and supplications will do
nothing. It is not enough for a sick person to tell the doctor: “Give
me health; I want to get better.” The doctor can do nothing if the
sick person doesn’t do what is required.”
        4) Then, could the privation of communicating with certain
spirits be a kind of punishment?


                                    339

                            Chapter XXIII


       “In certain cases it may be a bona fide punishment, just as the
possibility of communicating with them is a reward that they should
try to merit.” (See Loss and Suspension of Mediumship, no. 220)
       5) Can’t we also combat the influence of evil spirits by guiding
them morally?
       “Yes, and that is exactly what you should do because it is
often a duty that has been given you, which you should charitably
and devotedly fulfill. By means of your good counsels, you may
lead them to repentance and hasten their advancement.”
       – How can we have more influence than the spirits themselves
in this case?
       “Perverse spirits more often draw close to humans, whom
they seek to torment, rather than spirits, whom they try to avoid as
much as possible. When they draw close to individuals who attempt
to moralize them, they at first do not listen and even laugh at them;
however, if such individuals know how to persist in the matter,
these spirits end up being affected by them. High order spirits can
only address them in the name of God, and this terrifies them.
Humans obviously have no more power than high order spirits,
but their language is more accessible to a less evolved nature, and
seeing the influence they can exert over low order spirits, they better
comprehend the solidarity between heaven and earth. Furthermore,
the ascendancy that humans can have over spirits is in proportion
to their superior moral development. They cannot dominate highly
evolved spirits, or even those who, without being so evolved, are
nevertheless good and benevolent. However, they can dominate
spirits who are of low moral development.” (See no. 279)
       6) If it develops further, can corporeal subjugation lead to
insanity?
       “Yes, a kind of insanity whose cause the world does not
recognize, but which is in no way connected to ordinary insanity.
Among those who are treated as insane, there are many who are


                                 340

                             Obsession


really subjugated instead. They require moral treatment because
they become truly insane when they are given treatments intended
for an organic cause. When doctors understand Spiritism
sufficiently, they will know how to make the distinction and will
heal a larger number of ill persons than they do with their present
techniques.” (See no. 221)
       7) What should we think of those who see some kind of danger
in Spiritism, and who think that the best way to prevent it would be
to prohibit spirit communications altogether?
       “Even if they could prohibit certain persons from
communicating with spirits, they could not prohibit the
spontaneous communications given to these same persons, because
they can neither suppress spirits nor prevent them from exerting
their secret influence. Such an attitude resembles that of children
who close their eyes and believe that no one can see them. It would
be crazy to suppress something that offers great advantages just
because imprudent people might abuse it. The way to prevent
problems is rather to make this Doctrine fully understood.

       The Identity of Spirits
           • Possible Proofs of Identity • Distinguishing
            between Good and Evil Spirits • Questions
           concerning the Nature and Identity of Spirits



               Possible Proofs of Identity
       255. The issue of spirit identity is one of the most
controversial, even among the followers of Spiritism, because
spirits obviously do not bring any documention with them, and we
know that some of them very readily use borrowed names. Hence,
after obsession, this is one of the greatest difficulties of practical
Spiritism. In many cases, however, the matter of unmistakable
identity is secondary and is of no real significance.
       It is most difficult to prove the identity of ancient personages
and it often becomes even impossible, rendering only the possibility
of making a purely moral appraisal. We judge spirits as we judge
individuals – by their language. For example, if a spirit presents itself
using the name Fenelon, but states only trivialities and puerilities,
it is obviously not Fenelon. However, if what it says is worthy of
Fenelon’s character and which he himself would not repudiate, we


                                  343

                                           Chapter XXIV


at least have some material and moral proof of the great possibility
that it is indeed Fenelon. It is in these cases, especially, that true
identity becomes a secondary issue: if the spirit says only honorable
things, it really does not matter what name it uses.
       Undoubtedly, some will object that if a spirit were to take
an assumed name, even for good purposes, it would nevertheless
be committing fraud, and therefore could not be a good spirit. At
this point, delicate issues arise which are difficult to comprehend,
but which we shall attempt to address.
       256. As spirits purify themselves and ascend within the
hierarchy35, the distinctive characteristics of their personality more
or less disappear into the uniformity of perfection, but this does
not mean that they do not retain their individuality. This applies
both to high order spirits and pure spirits. At this level, the names
they used while on earth during a thousand ephemeral existences
are something quite insignificant. Furthermore, we have noted that
spirits mutually attract one another through their similar qualities
and they comprise sympathetic groups or families. On the other
hand, if we were to consider the huge number of spirits, who,
since time began, must have finally reached the highest ranks, and
if we were to compare the highly limited number of individuals
who have left a great name on the earth, we would understand
that among the high order spirits who can communicate with us,
most are nameless. However, since we need names to fix our ideas
to, they may take on a name of a familiar personage whose nature
most identifies with their own. It is thus that our guardian angels
most of the time make themselves known by using the name of a
saint whom we venerate. Hence, if a person’s guardian angel uses
the name St. Peter, for example, there is actually no material proof
that it is in fact the apostle. It could instead be an entirely unknown

                          The Identity of Spirits


spirit belonging to the family of spirits to which St. Peter himself
belongs. The fact is that no matter by what name we evoke our
guardian angel, it will answer our call because it is attracted by our
thought – the name is irrelevant.
         The same occurs whenever a highly evolved spirit
communicates by using the name of a known personage. Nothing
proves that it is in fact the spirit of that personage, but if it said
nothing during its spontaneous dictation that would belie the
spiritual elevation of the name it uses, then there is a presumption
that it is who it claims to be. And, in any event, we may state that
if it is not the actual spirit, it must be one of the same level, or even
one who has been sent by it. In sum, the issue of names is secondary,
since we can regard a name as simply being an indication of the
place the spirit occupies in the Spirit Hierarchy.
         The situation is otherwise when a low order spirit assumes
a respectable name in order to add believability to its words. This
situation is so common that we can never be too careful regarding
such substitutions, because it is thanks to borrowed names –
especially with the aid of fascination – that certain theorizing
spirits, who are more proud than wise, try to impose the most
ridiculous ideas.
         Therefore, as we have said, the issue of identity is more
or less indifferent when addressing general instructions, since
the most elevated spirits can substitute for one another without
causing problems. Highly evolved spirits comprise a collectivity,
so to speak, wherein individualities are, with a few exceptions,
completely unknown. We are more interested in the teaching than
in the individual; thus, if the teaching is good, it matters little
whether it has come from Peter or Paul. We must judge it by its
quality rather than by its name. If a bottle of wine is bad, the label
will not make it any better. However, the situation is different with
intimate communications because then it really is the individual,


                                   345

                              Chapter XXIV


or his or her personality in whom we are interested. It is then with
good reason that we try to assure ourselves that the manifesting
spirit is really the desired one.
       257. Identity is much easier to verify when dealing with
contemporary spirits whose habits and character are well known
because such habits are precisely what they have not had time to
free themselves from, and which enable us to recognize them. We
could say that it is one of the surest signs of identity. A spirit can
obviously provide proof through the answers it gives to questions
asked of it, but only when it is appropriate, for usually requests of
this nature will insult it and it is best to avoid asking them. When
a spirit leaves its body, it does not rid itself of its susceptibility, and
any question meant to put it to the test will offend it. There are
questions that no one would ask it during life out of fear of offending
it, so why would we want to treat it with any less consideration
after death? If a man attending an exclusive function declined to
give out his name, would someone ask him to prove his identity
under the pretext that there are imposters? This gentleman would
have the right to remind such a person of the rules of civility. Such
is the case with spirits who either do not respond at all or who
withdraw. Let us take an example for comparison. Suppose that the
astronomer Arago presented himself while alive at a home in which
no one recognized him and was received with these words: “You say
you’re Arago, but we don’t recognize you, so we need you to prove it
by answering a few questions: solve this astronomical problem and
give us your Christian name, your surname and the names of your
children; also, tell us what you did at such and such a time on such
and such a day, etc.” How would he respond? As a spirit he would
do what he would if alive; other spirits would do the same.
      258. Even though they refuse to answer puerile and absurd
questions, which we would not dare ask of them if they were alive,


                                   346

                          The Identity of Spirits


spirits nonetheless often provide spontaneous and unarguable
proof as to their identity. They do so by revealing their character
through their language, by their use of expressions that had been
peculiar to them, and by referring to certain significant events and
particularities of their lives that are sometimes unknown to their
audience, but whose veracity may nevertheless be verified. Proofs
of identity also result from many unforeseen circumstances that
do not always appear the first time, but which do so in subsequent
manifestations. Thus, it is prudent to wait for them instead of
eliciting them, cautiously observing all those that may spring from
the nature of the communications. (See the related case in no. 70)
       259. A method that is sometimes used successfully to
confirm identity whenever the spirit is suspect is to make it affirm
in the name of Almighty God that it is who it says it is. A usurper
will often falter before committing sacrilege. After having begun
to write: I affirm in the name of…, it will stop and angrily scribble
some meaningless marks or break the pencil. A more hypocritical
spirit will skirt the problem by omitting something, for example,
writing: I assure you that I am telling the truth; or: I affirm, in God’s
name, that it is I myself who am speaking to you, etc. However, there
are some who are not even that scrupulous, who will swear by
anything you want them to. One of them used to communicate
with a medium saying, “I am God himself ”, and the medium,
being highly honored with such elevated grace, did not hesitate to
believe it. When we evoked it, it did not dare keep up the charade
and said: “I am not actually God, but I am his son.” “So then
you’re Jesus? (Of course, this was not probable, because Jesus is
too elevated to resort to subterfuge). Do you dare affirm in God’s
name that you are Christ?” “I didn’t say I’m Jesus; I said I’m a son of
God because I’m one of his creatures.”
       We should conclude from this that when a spirit refuses to
affirm its identity in the name of God, it is always proof that the

                                   347

                            Chapter XXIV


name it is using is fraudulent, but an affirmation only provides us
with the presumption and not the proof of identity.
      260. Among the proofs of identity we may also place
similarity of handwriting and signature. However, such a means of
proof is not available to all mediums, and neither does it represent
a foolproof guarantee, for there are forgers in the spirit world
as well as in our own. Therefore, there is only a presumption of
identity, which acquires value only within the circumstances in
which it is produced. The same applies to all physical signs, which
some individuals provide as talismans that cannot be imitated by
deceiving spirits. However, for spirits who dare perjure themselves
in God’s name or who imitate a signature, no physical sign could
possibly present much of an obstacle. The best of all proofs of
identity is in the language and unforeseen circumstances.
       261. One could certainly say that if a spirit can imitate a
signature, it can also imitate language. That is true. We have seen
those who ignominiously assume the name of Christ, and for an
even better deception, imitate his evangelical style by indulging
in well known expressions such as: Verily, verily I say to you. If we
would study the writing without allowing ourselves to be influenced,
however, deeply scrutinizing the thoughts and the character of
the expressions, and noticing that alongside the beautiful maxims
of charity there are puerile and ridiculous recommendations, we
would have to be completely fascinated to be fooled. Yes, certain
formal aspects of language can be imitated, but not of thought.
Ignorance will never imitate true wisdom, just as vice will never
imitate true virtue. The spirit will eventually show its true colors.
That is when the medium and the evoker must use all their
discernment and reasoning to separate the truth from the lie.
They must persuade themselves that perverse spirits are capable
of all sorts of fraud, and that the more elevated the name a spirit


                                348

                         The Identity of Spirits


uses, the more distrust it should arouse. How many mediums have
received apocryphal communications signed by Jesus, Mary or
some venerated saint!

Distinguishing between Good and Evil Spirits
       262. If the perfect identification of spirits is in many cases a
secondary, unimportant issue, the same cannot be said concerning
the distinction between good and evil spirits. We may be indifferent
as to their individuality, but never their quality. In every instructive
communication, this is the point upon which we must concentrate
our attention, since only it can provide us with a measure of
confidence that we can put in the manifesting spirit, no matter what
name it has assumed. Is the spirit who has manifested itself good
or evil? To what degree of the hierarchy does it belong? That is the
crucial question. (See Spirit Hierarchy, no. 100, in The Spirits’ Book)
       263. As we have stated, we judge spirits by their language in
the same way as we do people. Let us suppose that a man receives
twenty letters from persons he does not know. By their style, ideas
and numerous characteristics he will be able to tell which are
educated and which are uneducated, which are polite or impolite,
superficial, profound, frivolous, proud, serious, sentimental, etc.
The same applies to spirits. We should regard them as unknown
pen pals and ask ourselves what we would think of their knowledge
and character if they stated or wrote such things. We can state as an
invariable rule, without exception, that the language of spirits always
corresponds to their degree of evolution. Truly high order spirits do
not limit themselves to saying only good things, but they say them
in terms that absolutely exclude any trivialness. No matter how
good statements may appear to be, if they are stained with a single
expression of low quality, it provides us with an unquestionable


                                  349

                            Chapter XXIV


sign of inferiority, and even more so if the communication offends
social values because of its grossness. Language always reveals
its origin, whether by thought or by form. Thus, even if a spirit
wanted to deceive us with its pretended superiority, we would only
have to converse with it for awhile to discern its true character.
       264. Benevolence and kindness are also essential attributes of
purified spirits. They do not feed hate toward humans or other spirits.
They pity weakness and criticize error, but always with moderation
and without bitterness or animosity. If we believe that truly good
spirits can want only what is good and say good things, we must
conclude that everything in the language of spirits that denotes a lack
of benevolence and kindness cannot have come from a good spirit.
       265. Intelligence is far from being a sure sign of moral
superiority, because intelligence and morality do not always
develop in tandem. A spirit can be good, kind and of limited
knowledge, while an intelligent and educated spirit can be quite
inferior morally.
       It is generally believed that in questioning the spirit of
someone who had been knowledgeable in a certain specialty while
on earth, one will more surely obtain the truth. This would seem
logical, but nonetheless it is not always the case. Experience has
shown us that scholars, as much as other men and women, and
especially those who left the earth a short time ago, are still under
the control of the prejudices of their corporeal life, and are not
immediately free of a theorizing mind. It is also the case that,
influenced by the ideas that had nourished and provided them
with glory during life, they see things with less clarity than we
might suppose. However, we do not state this principle as a rule -
far from it. Rather, we only warn that this may happen, and that
as a result their scholarliness as humans is not always a guarantee
of their infallibility as spirits.


                                 350

                        The Identity of Spirits


       266. By submitting all communications to rigorous
examination, probing and analyzing their ideas and expressions as
if we were appraising a literary work, rejecting without hesitation
everything that is contrary to logic and common sense and
everything that belies the character of the spirit who claims to
be manifesting, we will be able to discourage deceptive spirits,
who will thus withdraw, since they will be convinced that they
cannot deceive us. We will repeat that this is the sole means, but
it is nevertheless infallible, for no evil communication can bear
up under rigorous criticism. Good spirits are never offended at
such examination, because they have nothing to fear and they
themselves have counseled us to proceed in this manner. Only evil
ones are offended and try to dissuade us since they have everything
to lose – an attitude that proves who they really are.
       Here is the advice that St. Louis has given on the matter:
       “No matter how legitimate the trust that the directing spirits
of your works may inspire in you, there is a recommendation
that can never be repeated too often, and which you must always
bear in mind as you pursue your studies: weigh and analyze all
the communications you receive, submitting them to the most
rigorous control of reason. Whenever anything appears to be
suspect, doubtful or obscure, do not neglect asking for all the
explanations needed to form your opinion.”
       267. Let us sum up the means for recognizing the quality of
spirits in the following principles:
       1) There is no other criterion for discerning the worth of
spirits, except common sense. Any other formula toward this end,
even if given by spirits themselves, is absurd and could not have
come from highly evolved spirits.
       2) We judge spirits by their language and actions. Spirits’
actions involve the sentiments they inspire and the counsels they
provide.

                                 351

                             Chapter XXIV


       3) Accepting the fact that good spirits can only say and do
what is good, then everything that is bad cannot have come from
a good spirit.
       4) The language of high order spirits is always noble,
elevated and dignified without any mixture of trivialness. They
state everything simply and modestly; they never boast, and they
never make a show of their wisdom or their position among the
other spirits. The language of low order or ordinary spirits always
contains some reflection of the human passions. Every expression
that reveals low character, self-importance, arrogance, boastfulness
or sarcasm is a sure sign of inferiority and deceitfulness if the spirit
presents itself using a respectful and venerated name.
       5) We must not judge spirits according to the formality and
correctness of their style, but must probe their inner character
and analyze their words, coolly and maturely weighing them
unhesitatingly. Any absence of logic, reason and prudence can
leave no doubt as to a spirit’s origin, whatever may be the name it
uses to adorn itself. (See no. 224)
       6) The language of elevated spirits is always identical – if not
in form, at least in substance. Their ideas are the same, whatever
may be the time and place. Their communications might be more
developed or less so, depending on the circumstances, needs or
ease of communicating, but they will never be contradictory. If
two communications under the same name contradict each other,
one of them is obviously apocryphal. The true one will be the one
in which nothing belies the known character of the personage.
Between two communications signed by St. Vincent de Paul, for
example, one proclaiming unity and charity, and the other tending
to sow disharmony, no sane person could possibly be deceived.
       7) Good spirits only say what they know, keeping quiet or
confessing their ignorance about what they do not know. Evil
spirits confidently talk about anything without any regard for the


                                  352

                         The Identity of Spirits


truth. Every notorious scientific heresy, every principle that offends
common sense reveals fraud, even though the spirit presents itself
as being enlightened.
       8) Frivolous spirits are further recognizable by their
willingness to foretell the future and to specify the dates of physical
events that we should not know about. Good spirits may enable
us to have a presentiment of future things when such knowledge
is useful, but they are never precise as to dates. Any proclamation
of an event to happen at a specific time is an indication of fraud.
       9) Highly evolved spirits express themselves simply without
prolixity. Their style is concise without excluding poetry in their
ideas and expressions. They are clear and intelligible to everyone and
do not require effort to be understood. They possess the art of saying
much in a few words, for every word has its just use. Less evolved
or pseudo-scholar spirits, on the other hand, hide the emptiness
of their ideas behind pompous phrases. Their language is always
pretentious, ridiculous or obscure by dint of appearing profound.
       10) Good spirits never give orders. They do not wish to
impose themselves, but only to provide counsel. If they are not
listened to, they withdraw. Evil spirits are authoritarian; they
give orders, want to be obeyed and do not withdraw no matter
what. All spirits who impose themselves betray their status. They
are exclusivist and absolute in their opinions and pretend to be
privileged with the truth. They demand blind trust and never
appeal to reason since they know that reason will unmask them.
       11) Good spirits are never flattering. They approve of any
good that is done, but always prudently. Evil ones use exaggerated
praise, and excite pride and vanity – though they proclaim
humility – and they seek to exalt the personal importance of those
whom they want to win over.
       12) High order spirits remain above formal puerilities in all
matters. Ordinary spirits are the only ones who give importance to


                                  353

                            Chapter XXIV


trifling details that are incompatible with truly elevated ideas. Every
meticulous prescription is a sure sign of inferiority and deception on
the part of a spirit who employs a pompous name.
       13) We must distrust any bizarre and ridiculous names used
by certain spirits who want to impose their credibility. It would be
extremely absurd to take such names seriously.
       14) We must equally distrust spirits who lightly present
themselves using highly venerated names, and only with much
reserve should we accept what they say. It is especially in such
a case that strict control becomes indispensable, because it is
frequently a mask that they wear to lead us to believe in their
pretended intimate relationships with pure spirits. In this way they
flatter the vanity of the medium and take advantage of it to induce
him or her to lamentable and foolish acts.
       15) Good spirits are very scrupulous regarding the attitudes
they wish to advise. In every case, they only have a serious
and eminently useful purpose in mind. Thus, we must regard
with suspicion all advice which does not display this character
or which reason would condemn, and we must maturely
reflect before accepting it; otherwise, we open ourselves to
unfortunate deception.
       16) Good spirits may also be recognized by their prudent
reserve when touching upon matters that may compromise us.
Unveiling evil is repugnant to them, whereas frivolous or malefic
spirits love exposing it. While good spirits seek to mitigate error
and proclaim indulgence, evil ones exaggerate it and breathe
discord through harmful insinuations.
       17) Good spirits teach only what is good. Every maxim, every
bit of advice that does not strictly conform to the purest evangelical
charity could not come from a good spirit.
       18) Good spirits only provide perfectly reasonable advice.
Every recommendation that departs from the straight line of


                                 354

                          The Identity of Spirits


common sense or the immutable laws of nature betrays the presence
of a narrow-minded spirit and is therefore unworthy of trust.
       19) Plainly evil or simply imperfect spirits also reveal
themselves through physical signs that should not deceive anyone.
Their action upon a medium is sometimes violent, provoking
brusque and jerking movements, a feverish and convulsive agitation
that contrasts with the calm and gentleness of good spirits.
       20) Imperfect spirits often take advantage of the means of
communication at their disposal to offer bad counsel, and they
arouse distrust and animosity among those whom they dislike.
Anyone who might unmask their deceit is especially a target of
their malevolence.
       Frail individuals become the target of their efforts and are led
by them into evil. They alternately use sophisms, sarcasm, abuse
and even physical proof of their occult power to better convince
such victims and turn them from the way of truth.
       21) The spirits of persons who have had a sole physical or
moral preoccupation on the earth, who have not yet managed to free
themselves from the influence of matter, continue to be dominated
by earthly ideas. Consequently, they bring with them some of the
prejudices and predilections, and even the same manias they had while
living on this world. This is easy to recognize by their language.
       22) The knowledge with which certain spirits often use to
adorn themselves with a sort of ostentation is no sign of superiority.
The true touchstone for verifying superiority is the inalterable
purity of their moral sentiments.
       23) It is not enough to simply question a spirit in order to
know the truth. We must above all know whom we are addressing,
for due to their own ignorance, less evolved spirits deal light-
heartedly with the most serious questions.
       It is also not enough for a spirit to have been a great individual
while on earth to subsequently be possessed of high knowledge in


                                   355

                            Chapter XXIV


the spirit world. Only virtue can purify it, bring it closer to God
and broaden its knowledge.
       24) The pleasantries of highly evolved spirits are often subtle
and keen, but never banal. Among mocking spirits – those who
are not too crass – biting sarcasm is almost always apropos.
       25) By attentively studying the character of the spirits who
manifest themselves – especially from the moral point of view –
we can recognize their nature and the degree of trust they deserve.
Common sense can never be deceived.
       26) In order to judge both spirits and individuals, we must
first know how to judge ourselves. Unfortunately, there are people
who make their own opinions the exclusive measuring stick for
good and evil, truth and falsehood. Everything that contradicts
their way of seeing things, their ideas, or the theory they have
invented or adopted, is bad in their sight. Such individuals
obviously lack the first condition for correct evaluation: rectitude
of judgment. However, they do not even realize it. This is the
defect that produces the most illusion.
       All the above instructions are the result of experience and
the teaching of the Spirits. We shall supplement them with the
answers provided by the Spirits themselves with regards to the
most important points.

         Questions concerning the Nature
             and Identity of Spirits
       268. 1) By what signs can we recognize high order and low
order spirits?
       “By their language, just as you distinguish between a
scatterbrain and a sensible person. We have already stated that
high order spirits never contradict one another and they only


                                 356

                           The Identity of Spirits


address worthy matters. They only desire goodness – that is their
sole preoccupation.
       “Less evolved spirits are still dominated by their materialistic
thinking. Their manifestations bear out their ignorance and
imperfection. Only highly evolved spirits understand all things
and judge them without passion.”
       2) Is a spirit’s scientific knowledge always a proof of its elevation?
       “No, because if it is still under the influence of matter, it
could still possess your vices and prejudices. There are people in
your world who are excessively jealous and proud. Do you think
they lose these defects when they leave the earth behind? After
they have departed it – especially those who nourished strong
passions – they are enveloped by a kind of atmosphere that retains
all such evil things.
       “These semi-imperfect spirits are to be more feared than
downright evil ones because most of them combine astuteness and
pride with intelligence. Their pretended knowledge enables them
to impose themselves on simple and uneducated individuals, who
accept their absurd and erroneous theories without examining
them. Although these theories cannot possibly prevail against the
truth, they nevertheless produce a temporary evil, because they
hinder the progress of Spiritism, and because mediums voluntarily
close their eyes to the worth of the communications they receive.
This point demands great study on the part of both enlightened
Spiritists and mediums. All attention should be geared toward
distinguishing between truth and error.”
       3) Many protector spirits present themselves using names of
saints or well-known personages. What are we to think of this?
       “All the names of saints and well-known personages are not
sufficient to designate the protector of each individual. There are
very few spirits with names that are recognized on the earth. That
is why they hardly ever give their names. Nonetheless, most of the


                                    357

                            Chapter XXIV


time you would like a name, so in order to satisfy you they take the
name of someone you know and respect.”
       4) Can’t such name-borrowing be regarded as fraudulent?
       “It would be fraudulent if done by an evil spirit with the
intent to deceive. However, if it is done with good intentions, God
allows it among spirits of the same order, since there is solidarity
and similarity of thought among them.”
       5) So when a protector spirit presents itself as St. Paul, for
example, we cannot be certain that it is actually the spirit or soul of
the apostle by that name?
       “Of course not, for there are thousands of people who
have been told that they have St. Paul or some other saint as
their guardian angel. But what does it matter as long as the spirit
protecting you is of the same order as the apostle Paul? I have
already told you that you need a name, and spirits use one in
order for you to call them and recognize them. You do the same
with the baptismal names you use for distinguishing yourselves
from the other members of your family. Spirits can also take the
names of the archangels Rafael, Michael, etc. without adverse
consequences.
       “Moreover, the more highly evolved a spirit is, the more its
power of radiation increases. You should know that a high order
protector spirit can watch over hundreds of incarnates. On earth
there are lawyers who manage the business dealings of a hundred
or two hundred families. Why would we be any less capable,
spiritually speaking, of morally guiding humans than those who
guide their material interests?”
       6) Why do communicating spirits so often use the names
of saints?
       “To identify with the customs of those to whom they address
themselves. They employ the names most capable of impressing
individuals according to their beliefs.”


                                 358

                          The Identity of Spirits


        7) Upon being evoked, do certain high order spirits always
answer in person, or do they send agents to transmit their thought, as
some people think?
        “Why wouldn’t they answer in person if they could? But if a spirit
cannot answer in person, an agent will necessarily speak in its name.”
        8) Is the agent always sufficiently enlightened to respond as the
spirit itself would?
        “Highly evolved spirits know to whom they can entrust the
duty of acting as their substitutes. Moreover, the more evolved
spirits are, the more they harmonize with one another in common
thought in such a way that personality does not matter, as it
shouldn’t among you either. Do you think that in the world of
high order spirits there are only those whom you deemed on earth
as being capable of instructing you? You are so inclined to believe
that there is nothing beyond your own world that you resemble
primitives who have never left their island and think that the
world does not extend beyond it.”
        9) We can understand this to be the case when addressing
serious teachings, but why do elevated spirits allow low order spirits
to use respectable names to sow error through often-perverse maxims?
        “They do not do so with their permission. Doesn’t the same
happen among you? You can be sure that those who deceive in this
way will be punished, and their punishment will be in proportion
to the seriousness of their fraud. Besides, if you were not imperfect,
you would have only good spirits surrounding you. If you are
deceived, you have no one to blame but yourselves. God allows it to
test your perseverance and discernment in order to teach you how
to distinguish truth from error. If you can’t, it is because you are not
sufficiently elevated and you need further lessons from experience.”
        10) Aren’t spirits of little advancement, but who are animated
by good intentions and the desire to progress, sometimes delegated to
replace a high order spirit in order to practice the art of teaching?


                                   359

                               Chapter XXIV


       “Never in big centers36; I mean, in serious centers, and for
a general order of teaching. The spirits who appear there do so on
their own account and, as you say, in order to practice. That is
why their communications, though good, always bear the mark
that indicates they are less evolved. They are delegated for such a
purpose only to give communications of secondary importance
and for those that we may call personal.”
       11) Ridiculous spirit communications are sometimes mixed in
with worthy maxims. How can we resolve this anomaly, which seems
to indicate the simultaneous presence of both good and evil spirits?
       “Evil or frivolous spirits also pronounce maxims but without
really realizing the reach or meaning of what they say. Are all those
who do this amongst you superior individuals? No, good and evil
spirits do not mix together. You can recognize the presence of good
spirits by the constant uniformity in good communications.”
       12) Are the spirits who induce us to error always aware of what
they are doing?
       “No. There are good but ignorant spirits, who nonetheless
can unknowingly be deceptive. When they become aware of their
insufficiency, they acknowledge it and only say what they know.”
       13) Does a spirit always have malicious intentions when it
communicates error?
       “No. If it is a frivolous spirit, it deceives with no other
purpose than to entertain itself.”
       14) Since certain spirits can deceive us with their language, can
they also assume a false appearance for seeing mediums?
       “That happens, but it is more difficult. In all cases it is only
for a purpose that the evil spirits themselves do not know about,
since they are being used as instruments for a lesson. A seeing
medium can see frivolous and lying spirits just as other mediums
can hear them or write under their influence. Frivolous spirits can

take advantage of the medium’s faculty in order to deceive him or
her with a false appearance, but it depends on the qualities of the
medium’s own spirit.”
       15) Are good intentions sufficient in order not to be deceived,
and if so, could truly serious persons, who do not mix idle curiosity into
their studies, also be exposed to fraud?
       “Less than others, obviously. But men and women always
display a few weaknesses that attract mocking spirits. They think
they are strong but they almost never are. They should distrust
themselves for the weakness arising from their pride and prejudices.
They hardly ever take these two causes into consideration, and
spirits take advantage of this fact. By flattering their weaknesses,
they are sure to succeed.”
       16) Why does God allow evil spirits to communicate and say
bad things?
       “Even the worst communication can provide you a lesson. It
is up to you to know how to discern it. All kinds of communications
are necessary to teach you how to distinguish between good and
evil spirits, and also to serve you as a mirror.”
       17) Can spirits suggest unjust reasons for distrust against certain
persons through written communications and estrange friends from
each other?
       “Perverse and jealous spirits can practice the same evils
that humans practice; thus, you must always be on guard.
Highly evolved spirits are always prudent and reserved when they
admonish you; they say nothing evil – they warn with tact. If they
want two individuals to stop seeing each other for their own good,
they will cause incidents that separate them in a natural way. An
utterance that sows discord and distrust always comes from an evil
spirit no matter what name it uses. Hence, always be suspicious
when a spirit says something bad against another, especially when
a good spirit has already said the opposite. Also distrust yourselves


                                   361

                               Chapter XXIV


and your own aversions. Accept only spirit communications that
are good, grand, beautiful and reasonable, and what your own
conscience approves of.”
       18) Due to the ease with which evil spirits infiltrate communications,
can we ever be certain as to the truth?
       “Yes, you can, because you can use your reason to judge
them. Whenever you read a letter, you know very well if it was
written by a low-life or a well-bred person, a fool or a sage. Why
should it be different with spirits who write to you? If you receive
a letter from a distant friend, how do you know it is actually
from him or her? The penmanship, you will say. But aren’t there
forgers who imitate every type of handwriting, and rogues who
can know your business dealings? Nevertheless, there are signs that
will prevent you from being deceived. The same applies to spirits.
Pretend that it is a friend who is writing to you, or that you are
dealing with the work of some author, and judge it accordingly.”
       19) Could high order spirits prevent evil ones from using false
names?
       “Of course they could, but the worse the spirits are, the more
obstinate they are and the more frequently they resist injunctions.
You should know, however, that high order spirits take more of an
interest in certain individuals than others, and when they deem it
necessary they know how to keep them from lies. Deceiving spirits
are powerless against such persons.”
       20) What is the reason for this partiality?
       “It is not partiality but justice. Good spirits are interested
in those who profit from their counsels and make serious efforts
to improve themselves. They favor these persons and help them,
but they do not bother with those who waste their time with
flowery speech.”
       21) Why does God allow spirits to commit the sacrilege of falsely
using venerable names?

                         The Identity of Spirits


        “You may as well ask why God allows people to lie and
blaspheme. Like people, spirits have their free will to use for good
or ill, but neither group will escape God’s justice.”
        22) Are there any formulas that are effective for expelling
deceiving spirits?
        “A formula is physical. A good thought directed toward God
is worth much more.”
        23) Some spirits have said that they possess written signs that
cannot be imitated – a kind of stamp by which they can be recognized
and prove their identity. Is this true?
        “The only signs highly evolved spirits possess for their
identity are the loftiness of their ideas and their language. Any
spirit can imitate a physical trait. As for less evolved spirits, they
betray themselves in so many different ways that only someone
who is blind could be deceived by them.”
        24) Can’t deceiving spirits also imitate thought?
        “They imitate thought as theater scenes imitate nature.”
        25) Is it always easy to detect fraud by a careful examination?
        “Absolutely. Spirits can only deceive those who allow
themselves to be deceived. Nevertheless, the eyes of a jeweler are
needed to tell a true gem from a fake, and whoever does not know
how to do so must go to a lapidary.”
        26) There are persons who allow themselves to be seduced by
flowery language, who are more interested in words than ideas, and
who misstate erroneous and common ideas as sublime. Since they are
so inept at judging other people’s work, how can they possibly judge
spirits’ work?
        “When they are modest enough to recognize their
insufficiency, they do not rely on themselves. When out of pride
they regard themselves as more capable than they really are, they
pay the penalty for their foolish vanity. Fraudulent spirits know
whom they are dealing with. There are simple persons with little


                                  363

                              Chapter XXIV


education who are more difficult to deceive than some who are
smart and scholarly. By flattering their vanity, spirits do with them
as they please.”
       27) Through their written communications, do evil spirits
sometimes betray themselves with involuntary, material physical signs?
       “The really skillful ones, no. The inept ones become
confused. Any meaningless and puerile sign is sure to indicate
inferiority. High order spirits do nothing useless.”
       28) Many mediums recognize good and evil spirits by either a
pleasant or disagreeable sensation as they approach. Is a disagreeable
impression, a convulsive agitation or uneasiness always indicative of
the evil nature of manifesting spirits?
       “A medium experiences the sensations of the state of the
manifesting spirit. When the spirit is happy, its state is peaceful,
light and calm; when unhappy, it is agitated and feverish, and this
agitation is naturally transmitted to the medium’s nervous system.
Moreover, the same applies to humans – those who are moral
display calmness and peace; those who are evil are always agitated.”
      There are mediums of greater or lesser impressionability, and for that
      reason we cannot consider agitation as an absolute rule. Herein, as in
      everything else, we must take the circumstances into account. The heavy
      and disagreeable nature of the sensation is produced by contrast because
      if the medium’s spirit sympathizes with the evil spirit who manifests,
      it will barely be affected if at all. However, we must not confuse the
      speed of writing produced by the extreme flexibility of certain mediums
      with the convulsive agitation that slower mediums can experience upon
      contacting imperfect spirits.

                General Considerations
       269. Spirits can communicate either spontaneously or by
answering our call; i.e., they can be evoked. Some persons think
that spirits should not be evoked at all, that it is preferable to wait
for one who wants to communicate. They believe that in calling
a certain spirit we cannot be sure that it is who it claims to be,
whereas one who comes on its own initiative better proves its
identity since it thus shows its desire to converse with us. In our
view that is a mistake, first of all because we are always surrounded
by spirits, most of whom are less evolved and who are eager to
communicate. Second, it is for that very reason that if we do not
evoke a particular spirit, we open the door for all those who would
like to enter. In an assembly where no one in particular is given
the floor, it would be open to everyone and we know what the

                                 365

                            Chapter XXV


results of that would be. By directly appealing to a certain spirit we
establish a link between us: we have called it by our will, and thus
have set up a sort of barrier to intruders. Without a direct appeal,
a spirit would often have no reason to come to us unless it was our
own familiar spirit.
       Both of these types of evocation have their advantages,
however, and there would only be problems if one of them were
excluded. Spontaneous communications present no problems
when we are in control of the spirits and are certain that we do not
allow evil ones to dominate. So it is almost always appropriate to
await the willingness of the spirits who want to manifest because
in this way their thought does not experience any restraint and
we can receive admirable communications, whereas a spirit who
is evoked may not be disposed to communicate at all or might be
incapable of communicating in the way we want it to. Moreover,
the scrupulous examination that we have advised is a guarantee
against bad communications. During regular Spiritist meetings,
especially when a sequential work is involved, there are always
spirits who come without our having to call them for the simple
reason that they are accustomed to the regularity of the sessions.
They nearly always appear spontaneously to address some subject,
develop a theme or provide guidance. In such cases, it is easy to
recognize them whether by their language – because it is always
the same – by their writing or by certain peculiar habits.
       270. When we want to communicate with one particular
spirit it is absolutely necessary to evoke it (see no. 203). If it can
answer, we usually receive the response: Yes or I am here or What
would you like of me? Sometimes it enters directly upon the subject,
responding to the questions that we intend to ask before we have
had a chance to do so.
       When a spirit is evoked for the first time, it is proper to
address it as precisely as possible. Questions formulated in a

                                 366

                              Evocations


curt and imperative way should be avoided because they could
be a motive for it to stay away. Questions should be affable and
respectful, proper to the particular spirit, and in all cases show the
benevolence of the evoker.
      271. We are often surprised at how quickly an evoked spirit
appears, even for the first time. One might say that it had been
forewarned. That is in fact what happens when we are preoccupied
beforehand with evoking it. This preoccupation is a sort of
anticipated evocation, and since our familiar spirits are always
nearby and attuned to our thought, they prepare for its coming,
so that if there are no obstacles, the spirit is already present upon
being evoked. Otherwise, the familiar spirit of the medium or
the questioner, or one of those who is normally present, will go
look for it, which does not require much time. If the evoked spirit
cannot come immediately, a messenger (the pagans used to call it
Mercury) sets a time – five minutes, a quarter hour, an hour or even
several days hence. When the spirit finally arrives, it will say, “I’m
here.” Then, we can begin to ask our questions.
      The messenger is not always a necessary intermediary,
because the evoker’s appeal can be heard directly by the spirit, as
will be explained in no. 282, quest. 5, concerning the method of
transmitting thought.
      When we recommended that the evocation be made
in the name of God, we meant for this recommendation to
be taken seriously and not lightly. Anyone who thinks it is a
meaningless formula would be better off to refrain from making
the evocation altogether.
      272. Evocations often present more difficulties to mediums
than spontaneous dictations, especially when trying to obtain
precise responses to circumstantial questions. To do so, special
mediums are necessary who are both flexible and positive, and


                                 367

                            Chapter XXV


we have already seen (no.193) that they are very rare, because as
we have also already stated, fluidic connections cannot always
be instantaneously established with the first spirit who puts in
its appearance. Thus, mediums should not become involved in
evocations for detailed questions without being sure about the
development of their faculties and the nature of the spirits who
answer, since if the mediums are not surrounded by good spirits,
the evocations cannot be of an authentic character.
       273. Mediums are normally more sought out for evocations
involving private interests than for evocations of a general interest.
This may be explained by the very natural desire to converse
with loved ones. We think that it would be wise to make several
important recommendations to mediums about this matter.
First, they should not over-willingly accede to this desire when it
involves individuals whose sincerity is not certain, and they should
be on guard against traps that malevolent persons could set for
them. Second, they should not, under any circumstance, rush
into an evocation if they intuitively sense mere curiosity and self-
interest rather than a serious intention on the part of the evoker,
and they should refuse to propose any idle question or one that is
not within the ambit of those that may be rationally proposed to
spirits. Questions should be asked clearly and precisely, without
ulterior motives, in order to obtain categorical responses. Any
questions of an insidious character should be rejected because
spirits do not appreciate questions that might put them to the
test. To insist on questions of this nature is the same as to want
to be deceived. The evoker should frankly and openly stick to the
purpose without subterfuge and meaningless detours. If the evoker
is afraid to explain him or herself, it would be better to abstain.
       It is also best to be very cautious when making evocations in
the absence of those who request them, and most of the time it is
best not to make them at all. The reason is that only such persons

                                 368

                              Evocations


are capable of controlling the responses, of judging the identity of
the spirit, eliciting clarifications aroused by the answers and asking
occasional questions to which the circumstances might lead.
Furthermore, their presence is a link which attracts the spirit, who
is normally little disposed to communicate with strangers for whom
it has no affinity. To sum up: mediums should avoid anything that
might transform them into consultation instruments, which for
most people is equivalent to fortune tellers.

             Spirits Who May Be Evoked
      274. We may evoke all spirits no matter to which degree of
the scale they belong: good ones and evil ones, those who recently
departed life or those who lived in the most distant past, illustrious
persons or the most obscure, our relatives, friends and those who
are not related to us. This, however, does not imply that they will
always want to answer our appeal or that they even can. Regardless
of their own desire or request, which may be refused by a higher
power, they can be prevented by reasons that we cannot always
understand. What we mean to say is that there is no impediment
to communications per se – except what we will deal with next.
Obstacles to manifestation are almost always of an individual
nature and frequently result from the circumstances.
      275. Among the causes that can interfere with a spirit’s
manifestation, some are proper to the spirit itself, while others are
outside it. Among the former we should place the occupations or
missions in which it is involved, and from which it cannot leave in
order to answer to our own desires. In this case its manifestation is
merely postponed.
      Moreover, there is also its own situation to consider. Although
incarnation per se is not an absolute obstacle, it can comprise an


                                 369

                             Chapter XXV


impediment on certain occasions, particularly if it has occurred on
a less evolved world, or if the spirit itself is little-dematerialized.
On higher worlds, where the ties that bind the spirit to matter are
very fragile, manifestation for the spirit is almost as easy as during
the errant state, and in every case easier than on worlds where
corporeal matter is more compact.
       Outside causes have mostly to do with the nature of
the medium, that of the evoker, the environment where the
evocation occurs and, finally, the purpose of the evocation. Some
mediums very easily receive communications from their familiar
spirit, who may be more evolved or less so, whereas others are
capable of serving as intermediaries for all spirits. It all depends
on the sympathy or antipathy, the attraction or repulsion that
the medium’s spirit exerts over the one being evoked, who may
willingly or very unwillingly use it as its interpreter. Without
taking the personal qualities of mediums into account, it also
depends on the development of their mediumship; spirits come
more willingly and are especially more precise with mediums who
do not offer any material obstacles. Whenever there is equality of
moral conditions, then the more capable mediums are to write
or otherwise express themselves, the broader their relationships
with the spirit world.
       276. We must further consider the ease that arises from
habitually communicating with a particular spirit. Over time the
communicating spirit identifies with both the medium’s spirit
and the evoker’s spirit. Regardless of the issue of sympathy, they
establish fluidic ties that make communicating easier. This is why
the first manifestation is not always as satisfactory as we may
desire, and also why the spirits themselves always ask to be evoked
again. A spirit who customarily manifests feels at home: it has
become familiar with the audience and the interpreters; it speaks
and acts more freely.

                                 370

                              Evocations


        277. In sum, what we have just explained means that
the ability to evoke any and every spirit does not imply that a
particular spirit is obligated to be at our disposal. It may answer us
on one occasion but not on another; it may work with a particular
medium or evoker who pleases it, but not with another; it can say
what it wants without being coerced to say what it does not want to
say; it can withdraw at any time, and finally, for reasons depending
on its own will or of another, after having been cooperative for
some time, it can suddenly cease to appear any more.
        For these reasons, whenever we want to evoke a new spirit,
we must ask our protector guide if the evocation is possible. If it is
not, the guide usually states its reasons for the hindrance, and then
it would be futile to insist.
       278. Here, an important question arises as to whether or
not it is proper to evoke evil spirits. This depends on the purpose
and the ascendancy one has over them. It is not improper when
evoking them for a serious purpose, for instructing and helping
them improve themselves. On the other hand, it is highly improper
when done out of mere curiosity or for entertainment, or if we put
ourselves at their disposal by asking them some favor. Good spirits
in this case may very well give evil spirits the power to do what has
been asked of them, but reserve the right of later severely punishing
the audacious persons who dared invoke their aid, considering them
more powerful than God. It would be a vain intent to promise to
use the aid for a good purpose and to dismiss the spirit servant once
and for all after the service has been rendered. Such service, no
matter how small, represents a true pact with evil spirits, and they
do not easily relinquish their prey. (See no. 212)
      279. Only through moral superiority may one exert
ascendancy over less evolved spirits. Perverse spirits recognize the
superiority of morally upright men and women. When facing


                                 371

                            Chapter XXV


people who try to oppose their fierce energy using only their own
willpower, they react against such persons with a kind of brute
force and often prove to be the stronger. A certain individual, who
thus sought to dominate a rebellious spirit through willpower,
received this response: “Leave me alone with your braggart airs. You
are no better than me. What would you say about one thief preaching
morality to another?”
       It may seem very surprising that when the name of God is
invoked against such spirits it hardly ever has any effect. St. Louis
explains the reason for this in the following response:
       “The name of God only has any influence over imperfect
spirits when the one who invokes it can do so with the authority of
his or her own virtues. Coming from the mouth of someone who
is morally no better than the spirit, it is just an ordinary word like
any other. The same applies to sacred objects used to oppose them.
The most terrible weapon is inoffensive in hands that are unable
or incapable of using it.”

  The Proper Manner of Speaking to Spirits
       280. The degree to which spirits have evolved naturally
indicates the tone in which we should speak to them. It is obvious
that the more elevated they are, the more they deserve our respect,
consideration and submission. We should treat them with no less
deference than if they were still incarnate, but for other reasons:
during terrestrial life we would consider their job and their
social position, whereas in the spirit world we only respect them
for their moral superiority. This elevation in itself places them
above the puerilities of our formal flatterings. We will not win
their benevolence with mere words but with sincere sentiments.
Therefore, it would be ridiculous to give them the titles we use to
distinguish positions, and which in life would please their vanity.


                                 372

                             Evocations


If they are truly superior, they not only assign little importance to
these titles, but they also find them disagreeable. A moral thought
pleases them more than flattering epithets; otherwise, they would
not be above ordinary humanity. The spirit of a venerable priest,
who was a “prince of the church” while on earth, and who practiced
the teachings of Jesus, responded to someone who evoked him by
the title of ‘my Lord’: “You should at least say “ex-My Lord”, for
here there is only one Lord, who is God. You should know very
well that there are those here who kneeled before me while on
earth, but whom I kneel before now.”
       When addressing low order spirits, their particular character
determines the language we should employ. Among them are
those who may be inoffensive and even benevolent but who are
nevertheless frivolous, ignorant or foolish. To address them like
serious spirits as some people do would be the same as if we were to
bow before a grade school student or a donkey wearing a doctoral
hood. A casual tone is certainly not strange to them, nor does it
offend them. On the contrary, that is what they prefer.
       Among the less evolved spirits are those who are unhappy.
Whatever the wrongs they are expiating, their sufferings deserve
our pity all the more, for no one escapes these words of Christ:
“Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone.” Treating them
with benevolence is consoling to them. In their need of sympathy,
they ought to find in us the same tolerance that we would want
for ourselves.
       Spirits who show how little-evolved they are through their
cynical language, lies, base sentiments and perfidious advice are
certainly less worthy of our interest than those whose words display
their repentance, but we should nonetheless treat them with at
least as much pity as the great criminals inspire in us. The way to
reduce them to silence is by showing that we are of a higher order
than they because they only establish relationships with persons


                                373

                            Chapter XXV


of whom they have nothing to fear. Perverse spirits recognize
the superiority of moral individuals just as they recognize the
superiority of high order spirits.
       To summarize: it would be irreverent to treat high order
spirits as our equals just as it would be ridiculous to show the same
deference to all spirits without exception. We should venerate
those who deserve it, recognize those who protect and assist us,
and show the others the same benevolence that we ourselves
might need someday. By unveiling the incorporeal world we
learn to understand it, and this understanding should guide our
relationships with its inhabitants. In their ignorance, the ancients
raised altars to them; for us, they are creatures who may be more
purified or less so than we ourselves are, and it is to God alone that
we raise altars.

      The Usefulness of Private Evocations
       281. Communications with highly evolved spirits or those
who animated great personages in antiquity are valuable for
their elevated teachings. These spirits have reached a degree of
purification that enables them to embrace a wider circle of ideas,
to unveil mysteries that surpass human possibilities, and to thereby
initiate us better than other spirits could into certain matters.
However, this does not mean that communications with lower
order spirits are worthless, because the observer can definitely learn
from them. To understand the customs of a nation one must study
it on every level. Whoever observes it in only one of its aspects
does not understand it well at all. The history of a nation is not
the history of its monarchs or its authorities; rather, to form an
opinion about it, we must research the life of its people and their
particular customs. Thus, high order spirits are the authorities of
the spirit world, and their very elevation places them above us

in such a way that we are amazed at the distance that separates
them from us. The more bourgeois spirits (may they forgive us for
this expression) make the conditions of their new existence more
palpable to us. Their connection between the corporeal and spirit
life is narrower, and we can comprehend it better because it touches
us more closely. By learning directly from them about what they
have become, what they think about and what individuals of all
conditions and characters experience – moral and cruel, great and
small, happy and unhappy individuals of our own times – in a
word: those who have lived among us, whom we have seen and
known, whose real lives we have witnessed with its virtues and
errors, we better understand their joys and sufferings; we share
in both and receive a moral lesson from both. This lesson is more
profitable the more intimate are the connections between the
spirits and us, since it is easier for us to put ourselves in the place
of one who is our equal than in that of another whom we only see
through the mirage of celestial glory. Ordinary spirits show us the
practical results of the great and sublime truths, which the high
order spirits give us in theory. Moreover, nothing is worthless in
the study of a science. Newton discovered the laws of universal
forces by observing the simplest phenomena.
        Evoking ordinary spirits has a further advantage in that it
puts us in contact with suffering spirits – those whom we may
comfort and help with good counsels in their advancement. Thus,
we can be useful while we learn. To seek only our own satisfaction in
our relationships with spirits would be plain selfish, and those who
fail to extend a helping hand to the unfortunate only prove their
own pride. What good would it do to obtain fine communications
from elevated spirits if doing so does not render us better, more
charitable and more benevolent toward our brothers and sisters of
this and the other world? What would become of impoverished
diseased persons if doctors refused to touch their open sores?

         Questions concerning Evocations
        282. 1) Could someone evoke spirits without being a medium?
        “Everyone can evoke spirits. Even though they might not be
able to manifest materially, they may nevertheless approach and
listen to the evoker.”
        2) Will a spirit who is evoked always answer when called?
        “It depends on its situation because there are circumstances
in which it is unable to answer.”
        3) What causes may prevent its coming?
        “First, its own will; next, its corporeal state if it is incarnate,
its mission or, perhaps, prohibition to appear.
        There are also spirits who can never communicate, who
because of their nature still inhabit worlds less evolved than earth.
Furthermore, those on globes of punishment cannot communicate
unless they have received permission from higher up, which is
only granted in cases of general usefulness. In order for a spirit to
communicate, it must have reached the degree of evolution of the
world to which it is called because otherwise it will be foreign to the
culture of such world and will not have the means of comparison
available for expressing itself. This does not apply to those who
have been sent on a mission or for expiation to less evolved worlds,
because they possess the ideas needed for responding.”
        4) For what reasons might a spirit be denied permission to
communicate?
        “It may be a trial or punishment for it or for the one who
calls it.”
        5) Can spirits, who are scattered throughout space or on different
worlds, hear the evocations that are directed to them from all points
of the universe?
        “They are frequently informed by the familiar spirits, who
surround you and who go look for them. However, in such a case


                                   376

                               Evocations


there is a phenomenon that is difficult to explain to you, for you
cannot yet comprehend the way thought is transmitted between
spirits. Nevertheless, what I can say is that the evoked spirit, no
matter how far away, receives an impulse of thought, so to speak,
like a kind of electric shock, which calls its attention to the direction
from which the thought has been addressed to it. We may say that it
understands thought in the same way that you understand a voice.”
        – Is the universal fluid the vehicle for thought in the same way
that air is the vehicle for sound?
        Yes, with the difference that sound can only be heard over
a very short distance, whereas thought reaches the infinite. A
spirit in space is like a traveler, who, in the middle of a vast plain,
suddenly hears his name and turns in the direction from where he
has been called.”
        6) We know that distances mean nothing to spirits, but we
marvel at seeing them sometimes respond so quickly to the call – almost
as if they were already close by.
        “Sometimes they really were. If the evocation was
premeditated, the spirit has been forewarned and frequently is
present before being called.”
        7) Does the ease with which the evoker is heard depend on the
circumstances?
        “Undoubtedly. A spirit who is called with a thought
of sympathy and benevolence is more moved by it. It is as if it
recognizes the voice of a friend. If not called in this manner,
often the evocation cannot proceed. The thought emitted through
evocation touches the spirit, but if badly directed it becomes lost
in a vacuum. This also happens among individuals: if the one
addressed is not interested or is even antipathetic, he or she might
hear but most of the time will not answer.”
        8) Does an evoked spirit manifest voluntarily or is it constrained
to do so?


                                   377

                             Chapter XXV


       “It obeys the will of God, that is, the general laws governing
the universe. Nonetheless, “constrained” is not the right word,
since it deems whether or not it is convenient to answer, and in
doing so it exerts its own free will. A high order spirit will always
answer if called for a useful purpose. It will only refuse to respond
at meetings of non-serious persons, or those who try to evoke it as
a means of entertainment.”
       9) Can an evoked spirit refuse to answer?
       “Of course. If not, how could it have free will? Do you think
that all the spirits in the universe are at your beck and call? Do
you yourselves feel obligated to respond to everybody who calls
out your name? However, when I say that it may refuse, I am
referring to the evoker’s request, because a low order spirit can be
constrained by a higher order one to manifest.”
       10) Does the evoker have any means to force the spirit to answer
in spite of itself?
       “Not if the spirit is morally equal or superior – I say morally
and not intellectually – because in that case you would have no
authority over it at all. If it is morally inferior, however, you can
make it appear for its own good, for then other spirits will help
you.” (See no. 279)
       11) Would it be improper to evoke low order spirits, and could
there be any danger that they might dominate the evoker?
       “They only dominate those who allow them to. Evokers who
are assisted by good spirits have nothing to be afraid of, since they
dominate low order spirits – not the other way around. Whenever
mediums are alone, they should avoid this type of evocation,
especially if they are beginners.” (See no. 278)
       12) Is there any special kind of inner state necessary for
evocations?
       “The best state is one of contemplation when one wants
to communicate with serious spirits. With faith and a desire for


                                 378

                               Evocations


goodness one is more able to evoke high order spirits. By lifting the
soul in a few moments of contemplation at the time of evocation
one identifies with good spirits and makes them more amenable
to coming.”
       13) Is faith necessary for evocations?
       “Faith in God, yes. For everything else, faith will develop
with the desire for goodness and the intention of being taught.”
       14) When men and women are united in thought and intent
are they more able to evoke spirits?
       “Whenever all are united through charity and for good
purposes, they achieve great things. Nothing is more harmful to
evocations than differences of thought.”
       15) Is it a useful precaution to join hands for a few minutes at
the start of meetings in order to form a current?
       “A current is a physical method that produces no unity
among you if there is no corresponding unity of thought. It is
more effective to be united in a common thought with each
participant appealing to the good spirits. You have no idea of what
you could obtain during a serious meeting in which there is no
trace of pride or self-importance, but only a perfect sentiment of
mutual cordiality.”
       16) Is it preferable to make evocations at certain days and hours?
       “Yes. If possible in the same place as well. Then, spirits
more willingly appear. Your constant wish is what helps spirits to
come and communicate with you. They have their own concerns,
which they cannot suddenly leave unexpectedly for your personal
satisfaction. When I say “in the same place”, I am not implying an
absolute condition, because spirits can go anywhere. What I mean
is that it is preferable to have a place dedicated to meetings because
it leads to better contemplation.”
       17) Do certain objects like medallions and talismans have any
property for attracting or repelling spirits as some people claim?


                                  379

                            Chapter XXV


       “That is a pointless question, since you know that matter
exerts no influence over spirits. You can be sure that no good spirit
ever offered such absurd advice. The virtue of talismans of any
nature only exists in the mind of superstitious individuals.”
       18) What do you think about spirits who set appointments in
gloomy places at inconvenient times?
       “They are spirits who have fun with those who listen to
them. It is always useless and frequently dangerous to give into
such suggestions: useless, because absolutely nothing can be
gained beyond being deceived; dangerous, not because of what the
evil spirits might do, but because of the influence they might exert
over weak minds.”
       19) Are certain days and hours more propitious for evocations?
       “It does not matter at all to spirits – like everything else
material – and it would be superstitious to believe in the influence
of certain days and hours. The most propitious times are when
evokers are less involved in habitual occupations, and when their
body and spirit are calmer.”
       20) Is being evoked pleasant or unpleasant for spirits? Do they
willingly answer when we call them?
       “That depends on their character and the reason why
you call them. Whenever the objective is praiseworthy and the
means are sympathetic, evocation is pleasant and even attractive.
Spirits always feel happy with displays of affection. Some consider
it a great fortune to be able to communicate with humans and
they suffer when they are forgotten by them. However, this also
depends on their character, as I have already stated. Among spirits
there are misanthropes who do not like being inconvenienced, and
whose responses mirror their bad mood, especially when called
by individuals whom they do not care about. A particular spirit
often has no reason at all to answer the appeal of someone it does
not know or toward whom it is indifferent, and who is usually


                                 380

                                 Evocations


motivated by curiosity. In such a case, if it answers at all, it is
usually in quick appearances – provided there is actually a serious
and instructive objective in the evocation.”
      We have seen persons who only evoke their relatives in order to ask
      questions about the most ordinary matters of material life. For example:
      one wanted to know if he should rent or sell his house; others have wanted
      to find out what kind of profit they would make on their merchandise,
      the place where some money was hidden, or if such and such a business
      would be profitable or not. Our relatives beyond the grave are only
      interested in us due to the affection we still have for them. If all our
      thoughts are limited to treating them like fortune tellers, or if we only
      want information from them, they cannot show much sympathy for us
      and we should not wonder why they display little kindness toward us.

       21) Is there any difference between good and evil spirits with
respect to the willingness with which they answer our call?
       “There is a big difference. Evil spirits only answer
willingly when they hope to dominate and deceive; they are very
unwilling when they are forced to manifest in order to confess
their wrongs, and they try to get away like a school child who is
called up to be reprimanded. Nonetheless, they can be forced to
manifest by higher order spirits as a punishment and as a lesson
for incarnates. Evocation is unpleasant for good spirits when it
is for no purpose or for trivialities. They either do not answer at
all or soon withdraw.
       “Whoever they may be, spirits generally do not like to
serve as a distraction for the curious any more than you do.
You often have no other purpose for evoking a spirit than to see
what it might have to say to you, or to question it about some
particularity of its life, which it has no interest in revealing to
you because it has no reason to confide in you. Do you think
that it likes to be cross examined at your pleasure? Don’t fool


                                     381

                                Chapter XXV


yourselves. What it wouldn’t do while alive it will more likely
decline to do as a spirit.”
      Experience, in fact, has shown that evocation is always pleasing to spirits
      when done for a serious and worthwhile purpose. The good ones take
      pleasure in teaching us, and the suffering ones are consoled by our
      sympathy, while those we have known are pleased when we remember
      them. Frivolous spirits like to be evoked by frivolous persons because it
      gives them an opportunity to have fun at their expense, but they feel ill
      at ease in the company of serious individuals.

        22) Do spirits have to be evoked to manifest?
        “No. Most often they manifest without having been called,
which shows that they do so of their own accord.”
        23) When a spirit manifests without being evoked can we be
certain of its identity?
        “Not at all, for deceptive spirits often employ this means in
order to better deceive you.”
        24) When we evoke a spirit by our thought, will it answer even
if it doesn’t express itself through writing or some other means?
        “Writing is a physical means by which a spirit shows it is
present, but it is thought that attracts it and not the act of writing.”
        25) When a less evolved spirit manifests, can we make it withdraw?
        “Yes, by not listening to it. However, how can you expect
it to withdraw if you are amused at its turpitude? Like the fools
among you, low order spirits attach themselves to those who listen
to them complacently.”
        26) Is evocation in the name of God any guarantee against the
interference of evil spirits?
        “God’s name does not put all perverse spirits in check, but it
restrains many of them. It is a means for you to keep many away,
and it is even more effective if pronounced from the bottom of the
heart and not as a banal formula.”


                                     382

                                  Evocations


        27) Can we evoke several spirits at the same time by name?
        “This presents no difficulty. If there are three or four hands
to write with, three or four spirits will respond at the same time.
This happens when we have several mediums available.”
        28) When several spirits are evoked at once with only one
medium present, which one responds?
        “One of them will respond for all and will express the
collective thought.”
        29) Can the same spirit communicate at the same time in the
same session through two different mediums?
        “As easily as among you, certain individuals can dictate
several letters at once.”
        We have seen a spirit respond to questions at the same time
through two mediums: one writing in French and the other in
English, both being identical in meaning and sometimes even
literal translations of each other.
       Two spirits evoked simultaneously through two mediums may
       carry on a conversation. However, they do not require this form of
       communication since they can read each other’s thoughts – they do it
       sometimes for our instruction. If they are little-evolved spirits who are
       still imbued with earthly passions and notions that they held during
       their corporeal life, they may argue and shout swearwords, mutually
       accusing each other of their wrongs, and even throwing pencils, baskets
       or planchettes at each other.

       30) Can a spirit who is evoked at the same time in several places
respond simultaneously to the questions?
       “Yes, if it is a high order spirit.”
       – In such a case does the spirit divide itself up or does it possess
the gift of ubiquity?
       “The sun is only one whole, but nevertheless it radiates
its light everywhere, projecting its rays far and wide but without


                                     383

                                 Chapter XXV


dividing itself. The same applies to spirits. A spirit’s thought is
like a spark which projects its light afar and which can be seen
from every part of the horizon. The purer the spirit is, the more
its thought radiates and scatters like a light. Less evolved spirits are
too dense and cannot respond to more than one person at a time;
they cannot answer your evocation at all if they have already been
called to another place.
       “When called at the same time to two different places, a
highly evolved spirit will answer both evocations if they are equally
serious and fervent; otherwise, it will favor the more serious one.”
      The same thing happens when someone standing in one spot can transmit
      his or her thought through signals that are visible in many directions.

      During one session at the Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies, in which
      the issue of ubiquity was being discussed, a spirit spontaneously dictated
      the following:

      “You have been discussing the Spirit Hierarchy regarding the issue of
      ubiquity. You may compare us to a balloon that gradually rises into the
      air. While it is still near the ground, only a small circle of people can see
      it, but as it rises, the circle grows larger and when it has reached a certain
      height, it can be seen by a vast number. The same happens with us. An
      evil spirit, who is still attached to the earth, remains within a narrow
      circle of persons who perceive it. As it ascends and improves itself, it
      will be able to converse with many people. When it finally becomes a
      highly evolved spirit, it will radiate like the solar light, being perceived
      by several persons and in several places at the same time.”
                                                                      Channing

      31) Can pure spirits, who have already completed their series of
incarnations, be evoked?
      “Yes, but very rarely, because they only communicate with
pure and sincere hearts – none who are proud or selfish. Hence, you

                                      384

                                   Evocations


must distrust low order spirits who claim to be such spirits in order
to seem more important to you.”
      32) How is it possible for the spirits of the most eminent
individuals so easily and familiarly to answer the call of the most
obscure persons?
      “Humans judge spirits according to their own standards,
which is wrong. Earthly status disappears after corporeal death.
The sole standard among spirits is goodness, and those who are
good can go anywhere where there is a good deed to perform.”
      33) How soon after death can a spirit be evoked?
      “You could evoke it at the very moment of death, but since it
may still be in the state of confusion, it will not be able to respond
very well.”
      Since the duration of the state of confusion varies widely, it is impossible
      to set a specific timeframe for evocation. Nonetheless, it is rare that a
      spirit after eight days or so is not sufficiently aware of its state in order to
      respond. It may even be quite able two or three days after death, but in
      any case, one should proceed prudently.

       34) Is evocation at the moment of death more troublesome for
the spirit than it would be later on?
       “Sometimes. It would be like someone making you get up in
the middle of sleep before you are completely awake. Nevertheless,
there are some who have no problem at all, and evocation may
even help them out of the state of confusion.”
       35) How can the spirit of a child who died at a tender age
respond consciously if during its corporeal life it hadn’t yet arrived at
self-awareness?
       “A child’s soul is a spirit still wrapped in the swaddling clothes
of matter. When it is free of matter, however, it enjoys its spirit
faculties, for spirits have no age, which proves that the spirit of
the child has already lived before. Nonetheless, until it has been


                                       385

                                Chapter XXV


completely freed from its body, its conversation may still display
some childlike characteristics.”
      The body’s influence, which may last for some time in the spirit of a
      child, may also be noted in the spirit of those who have died insane.
      The spirit itself is not insane, but we know that some spirits continue
      to believe for awhile that they are still incarnated. Thus, it is no wonder
      that the spirit of an insane individual may still feel the impediment
      that had hindered its free manifestation during life until it has been
      completely freed. This effect varies according to the causes of the
      insanity, because there are insane persons who immediately recover
      their lucidity after death.



               The Evocation of Animals
       283. 36) Can we evoke the spirit of an animal?
       “The intelligent principle, which had animated the animal,
remains in a latent state after death. The spirits in charge of this
principle immediately utilize it to animate other beings, through
which it will continue the process of its development. Thus, in the
spirit world there are no errant animal spirits – only human ones.
This answers your question.
       – Then how may it be explained that certain persons have
evoked animals and have received responses?
       “Evoke a rock and it will respond. There are always scores of
spirits ready to talk for any reason.”
      For this same reason, when we evoke a mythological or allegorical
      personage, it will respond, which actually means that a spirit has
      responded in its stead. The spirit who presents itself as such a personage
      will take on its character and mannerisms. Once, someone got the idea
      to evoke Tartuffe and he soon appeared. What is more, he gave news
      concerning Orgon, Elmire, Damis and Valère. As for itself, it imitated


                                     386

                                  Evocations


      Tartuffe with so much skill that it appeared to be a real personage. It
      later confessed that it had been an actor who had once played the role.
      Frivolous spirits always take advantage of inexperienced questioners, but
      they avoid appearing to those who know how to expose their impostures
      and disbelieve their stories. The same occurs among humans.

      A certain gentleman took a keen interest in a nest of goldfinches in his
      garden. One day, the nest disappeared. He was certain that no one in his
      household had committed the theft, and since he was a medium, he got
      the idea to evoke the mother goldfinch. She responded in excellent French,
      “Don’t accuse anyone and don’t worry about the fate of my little ones. It
      was the cat that jumped up and knocked over the nest. You can find it
      out on the lawn along with the chicks, which were not eaten.” The man
      verified all the details to be correct. Should we therefore conclude that it
      was the actual bird who had responded? Of course not – simply a spirit
      who knew what had happened. This shows how much we should distrust
      appearances and how appropriate the above answer is: evoke a rock and it
      will respond. (See the chapter Mediumship in Animals, no. 234)



             Evocations of Living Persons
       284. 37) Does the incarnation of a spirit absolutely prevent
evoking it?
       “No, but the condition of its body must allow the spirit
to disengage at the time. An incarnate spirit answers more easily
when it inhabits a more highly evolved world, where the bodies
are less material.”
       38) Can we evoke the spirit of a living person?
       “Yes, since you can evoke an incarnate spirit. During its
moments of freedom, the spirit of a living person can also manifest
without being evoked; it depends on the affinity between the parties
involved.” (See no. 116, Story of the man with the snuff box)


                                      387

                               Chapter XXV


       39) What is the state of the body of the person whose spirit has
been evoked?
       “It sleeps or naps – that is when the spirit is free.”
       – Could it awaken while the spirit is away?
       “No. The spirit must have returned to the body first. If it is
communicating at the time, it will leave you and often say why.”
       40) How is the spirit warned that it must return to the body?
       “The spirit of a living person is never completely detached
from the body. No matter at what distance it may be it continues to
be attached by a fluidic cord that serves to recall it when necessary.
Only death can break this cord.”
      Seeing mediums often perceive this fluidic cord, which is a kind of
      phosphorescent trail that follows behind the spirit toward the body.
      Certain spirits have stated that they use it to recognize those who are
      still in the corporeal world.

      41) What would happen if the body were mortally wounded
during sleep and while the spirit was away?
      “The spirit would be warned and would return before death
was consummated.”
      – Then couldn’t death occur in the absence of the spirit, which
upon its return could no longer reenter its body?
      “No, because it would be contrary to the law that governs
the union between body and soul.”
      – But what if the body received a sudden blow?
      “The spirit will have been pre-warned before the fatal blow.”
      When asked about this, the spirit of a living person responded, “If the
      body could die while the spirit was away, it would be a very convenient
      way for committing suicide.”

       42) Can the spirit of a person evoked during sleep communicate
as easily as one evoked after death?
       “No. Matter always exerts an influence to some degree.”

                                   388

                                   Evocations


       The spirit of a person who was questioned while asleep responded, “I am
       always chained to this iron ball that I have to drag around.”

        – During sleep, could a spirit be prevented from answering
because it was somewhere else?
        “Yes, the spirit might be someplace where it wants to
remain, and will therefore not answer when evoked, especially if
by someone in whom it is not interested.”
        43) Is it completely impossible to evoke the spirit of someone
who is awake?”
        “Although it is difficult, it is not completely impossible, because
if the evocation is effective, the person might go to sleep. However, the
spirit can only communicate as a spirit at times in which its presence
is not required for the intelligent activity of the body.”
       Experiments have proven that evocation during the waking state can
       cause sleep or at least a state close to sleep. However, this effect can only
       be produced by a very energetic will and if there are bonds of affinity
       between the two individuals. Otherwise, the evocation will not take hold.
       Even when the evocation can cause sleep, if the time is inappropriate
       and the person does not want to sleep, he or she will resist. Even if sleep
       does occur, the spirit will be troubled and will respond with difficulty.
       Thus, the best time to evoke a living person is during natural sleep,
       because the spirit is free and can answer the call just as easily as it could
       go somewhere else. When the person consents to the evocation and tries
       to go to sleep, his or her preoccupation with it might delay sleep and
       disturb the spirit. That is why natural sleep is still preferable.

        44) Does a living person who is evoked remember it upon
waking?
        “No. You yourself have been evoked much more often than
you think. Only the spirit is aware of it, and sometimes may
provide the person with a vague impression of what has happened
as if it had been a dream.”


                                       389

                              Chapter XXV


       – Who would want to evoke us if we are unknown to him or her?
       “During other lives you could have been a well-known
person on this world or on others. Your relatives and friends
could also do so on this world and others. Let’s suppose that your
spirit had animated the body of someone else’s father. When this
person evokes his or her father, it is your spirit who will respond
to the evocation.”
       45) Does the spirit of a living person respond as a spirit or with
the ideas it has during its waking state?
       “That depends on its elevation, but it regards matters more
soundly and with less bias – exactly like somnambulists. The two
states are almost identical.”
       46) If the spirit of a somnambulist were evoked during magnetic
sleep, would it be more lucid than the spirit of someone else?
       “Of course, it would respond more easily because it would be
less attached. Everything depends on the degree of independence
between the spirit and the body.”
       – Could a somnambulist’s spirit respond to someone who evoked
it from some distant place and at the same time respond verbally to
another person?
       “The ability to communicate simultaneously in two different
places only belongs to spirits who are completely free of matter.”
       47) Could we change the waking-state ideas of someone by
acting upon his or her spirit during sleep?
       “Yes, sometimes. Since in sleep the spirit is not as strictly
tied to matter, it is more accessible to mental suggestions that
can influence its way of ordinarily seeing things. Unfortunately,
what nearly always happens is that upon awakening, the corporeal
nature dominates it and makes it forget about the good resolutions
that it may have made.”
       48) Is the spirit of a living person free to say or not to say
whatever it wants?


                                  390

                                 Evocations


        “It is in possession of its spirit faculties and therefore its free
will. Since it is more discerning, it is more cautious than during
the waking state.”
        49) Could we evoke persons and coerce them into stating
something they would rather keep quiet about?
        “As I said, the spirit has free will. Nevertheless, as a spirit it
might give less importance to certain matters than in its ordinary
state, so its conscience may speak more freely. Moreover, if it does
not wish to speak, it can always escape an uncomfortable situation
by leaving – no one can retain a spirit as one can retain a body.”
        50) Could the spirit of a living person be constrained by another
spirit to appear and speak, as happens with errant spirits?
        “Among the spirits of both the living and the dead there is
only one type of supremacy: moral superiority, and you should
understand that a high order spirit would never support a cowardly
indiscretion.”
       Such abuse of trust would in fact be wrong and would thus not yield a
       good result, because we cannot wrest a secret from a spirit who wants
       to keep it, unless it were overcome by a sense of justice and confessed
       something that under other circumstances it would keep quiet about.

       One particular individual wanted to find out through such means
       if one of her relatives had remembered her in his will. The spirit
       responded, “Yes, my dear little niece, as you shall soon find out.” The
       niece really had been remembered, but a few days later the relative
       destroyed the will and was malicious enough to inform his niece about
       it, although he did not know that he had been evoked. An instinctive
       feeling had undoubtedly led him to act on the resolution that his spirit
       had made after the question had been posed. It is pure cowardice to
       ask the spirit of either a deceased or living person what we would dare
       not ask the person face to face, and such cowardice never results in the
       hoped-for compensation.

                                  Chapter XXV


     51) Can we evoke a spirit whose body is still in the womb?
     “No, because you know that during this phase the spirit is
completely confused.”
       Incarnation only definitively takes place at the moment the child breathes.
       However, from the moment of conception the designated spirit is enveloped
       in a confusion which increases as birth approaches and which erases its self-
       consciousness. Thus, it cannot respond. (See The Spirits’ Book: The Return
       to Corporeal Life:The Joining of the Soul with the Body, no. 344)

      52) Could a deceiving spirit respond in the place of a living person?
      “Certainly, and this frequently happens, especially when
the evoker has ulterior motives. Moreover, the evocation of living
persons is only useful for psychological study. It should not be
done if there is no instructive purpose involved.”
       If the evocation of errant spirits does not always take hold (to use their
       own expression), such is even more the case involving incarnate ones.
       That is when deceiving spirits most often take their place.

      53) Are there drawbacks to evoking living persons?
      “It is not always free of danger, but it depends on their
condition. If they are ill, you might increase their misery.”
      54) When is evoking a living person inappropriate?
      “You should not evoke extremely young children, persons
who are gravely ill or infirm aged individuals. In other words, it is
inappropriate whenever the body is seriously debilitated.”
       The abrupt suspension of the intellectual faculties during the waking
       state could also present a danger if the person at the time required all his
       or her mental agility.

       55) During evocations of living persons, does their body become
tired because of the work of the spirit, even though the body is absent?
       One individual, who had been evoked, affirmed that his
body had become tired by responding: “My spirit is like a balloon


                                       392

                                  Evocations


attached to a post. My body is the post that is shaken by the jerking
movements of the balloon.”
       56) Since the evocation of living persons may be inappropriate
when done without taking precautions, isn’t there also danger in
evoking a spirit who does not know if it is incarnate and who might
be in some unfavorable state of affairs?
       “No, the circumstances are not the same. It will only answer
if the conditions are right. Moreover, haven’t I already said that
before making the evocation you should ask if it is possible?”
       57) When, during inconvenient moments, we feel irresistible
sleep coming over us, is it because we are being evoked somewhere?
       “It could be, certainly, but most often it should be regarded
as a simple physical need, whether because the body needs rest or
because the spirit needs its freedom.”
      We knew a lady, a medium, who one day got the idea to evoke the spirit of
      her grandson, who was sleeping in the same room. She confirmed his identity
      by his language, familiar expressions and a precise report on some things
      that had happened at boarding school. Then, something else happened to
      confirm it even further: the medium’s hand suddenly stopped mid-sentence
      and she couldn’t write anymore. At that moment the child was stirring
      half awake on the cot. He soon went back to sleep, and she continued the
      conversation without interruption. The evocation of living persons, when
      done under proper conditions, incontestably proves the distinct activity of
      the spirit and body, and therefore the existence of an intelligent principle
      that is independent of matter. (See Revue Spirite (1860) pp. 11 and 81 for
      several remarkable examples of evocations of living persons.)



                     Human Telegraphy
      285. 58) Can two persons evoking each other simultaneously
transmit their thought and communicate?


                                      393

                            Chapter XXV


       “Yes, and this human telegraphy will someday be a universal
means of communication.
       – Why can’t it be practiced at present?
       “It already is by some, but not by many. Men and women
must purify themselves more so that their spirit is freer of matter –
a further reason why evocation must be made in God’s name.
Until then, it will be restricted to pure souls and to those who are
dematerialized – something that is quite rare in the current state
of earth’s inhabitants.”

     Questions That May Be
      Addressed to Spirits

               Preliminary Observations
      286. We can never be too careful about the manner in which
we question spirits, and especially about the nature of the questions
themselves. We must consider two aspects of such questions:
form and scope. As for form, they should be addressed clearly and
precisely and should not be too complex. Another significant point,
no less important, is the order in which they should be posed. For
a subject that requires a series of questions, it is essential that they
be methodically linked together, with each proceeding logically


                                  395

                            Chapter XXVI


from the one before it. In this way, spirits respond much more
easily and clearly than if we were to ask at random, skipping from
one subject to another without any transition. That is why it is a
good idea to prepare questions beforehand, but during the session
others may be inserted, according to the circumstances. Besides,
such preparatory work will allow the questions to be drawn up
more calmly, and will be a sort of anticipatory evocation (as we
have stated), which the spirit might have watched and prepared
itself to address. We will notice that very often the spirit responds
to certain questions before they are even asked, which shows that
it already knew about them beforehand.
        The scope of the question requires even more serious
attention because often the nature of the questioning is what elicits
a correct or erroneous response. There are certain questions that
spirits cannot or should not answer for reasons unknown to us,
and it would therefore be futile to insist. However, the questions
we should be most careful to avoid are those that test the spirit’s
perspicacity. It is often said that if something is obvious, spirits
should know about it, but it is precisely those questions to which
we already know the answers, or which we are able to clarify by
ourselves, that they do not bother to answer. This distrust offends
them and nothing satisfactory will result from it. Don’t we often
see examples of the same thing amongst ourselves? Do very
knowledgeable individuals, who are aware of their own worth, like
to respond to foolish questions aimed at testing them as if they
were school children? The desire to make some person an adherent
is no reason for spirits to have to satisfy idle curiosity. They know
that sooner or later the person will be convinced, and the way this
is done is not always the way we might suppose.
        Consider a serious man, who is occupied with worthwhile
and serious matters, constantly being bothered by a child’s puerile
questions, and you will be able to see what highly evolved spirits


                                396

               Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


think about all the foolishness asked of them. This of course does
not mean that we cannot obtain worthwhile instruction and,
especially, excellent advice from spirits, but that they respond better
or worse according to their knowledge, their interest in us, the
affection they feel toward us, and, finally, our purpose for inquiring
of them and the usefulness with which they regard the subject.
However, if we limit ourselves by thinking that they are more
capable than others of informing us about questions concerning
this world, they will not regard us with much sympathy. From
then on they will visit us only hurriedly, and often, according to
their degree of imperfection, they will be in a bad mood for having
been needlessly inconvenienced.
        287. Some people think that it is best not to ask questions
at all, but rather to wait for a spirit’s teaching without requesting it.
This is a mistake, however. Spirits obviously provide spontaneous
teachings of an elevated reach, and which we should not neglect,
but there are explanations for which we would have to wait a long
time if we did not solicit them directly. Without the questions we
proposed, neither The Spirits’ Book nor this present work would
have ever been written, or would at least have been much less
complete, and many very important problems would still not
be resolved. Far from being inappropriate, questions are highly
important for our learning when we formulate them within proper
limits. They offer the further advantage of helping us unmask
deceptive spirits, who, more pretentious than knowledgeable,
rarely stand up under tightly logical examination, wherein the
questions lead them to finally exposing themselves. Since truly
high order spirits have nothing to fear about this process, they
are the first to suggest that we ask for explanations concerning
obscure points, whereas the others are afraid of confronting strong
arguments and take great care to avoid them. That is why they
usually suggest to the mediums whom they wish to dominate and

                                  397

                             Chapter XXVI


force to accept their utopian ideas to abstain from all controversy
regarding their teachings.
       Whoever has well understood what we have stated thus far in
this work already has some idea of the scope to which we should limit
the questions addressed to spirits. Nevertheless, in order to be more
certain we will now provide their responses to the main subjects that
individuals with little experience generally present to them.

  Appropriate and Inappropriate Questions
        288. 1) Do spirits willingly respond to the questions asked of
them?
        “It depends on the questions. Serious spirits take pleasure
in responding to those whose purpose is goodness and your
advancement. They do not listen to worthless questions, however.
        2) Is asking a serious question enough to receive a serious
response?
        “No. It also depends on the spirit who responds.”
        – But won’t a serious question keep frivolous spirits away?
        “It is not the question itself that keeps them away, but rather
the character of the one who asks.”
        3) What kinds of questions are particularly disagreeable to good
spirits?
        “All that are needless, asked out of curiosity or meant to test
them. They do not respond to these and will withdraw.”
        – Are there questions that are disagreeable to imperfect spirits?
        “Only those that can make them display their ignorance or
their ruse when they are trying to be deceptive. Otherwise, they
will respond to anything without any concern for the truth.”
        4) What about persons who only regard spirit communications
as a distraction or pastime, or as a way to obtain revelations about
questions of a personal note?


                                  398

                Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


       “Low order spirits like such persons very much, who, like
themselves, love entertainment, and they are very pleased when
they manage to deceive them.”
       5) When spirits do not respond to certain questions, is it
because they do not want to or because a higher power opposes certain
revelations?
       “It could be both. There are certain matters that cannot be
revealed, and others that the spirit does not know about.”
       – If we strongly insist, will a spirit finally respond?
       “No. If a spirit does not want to respond, it can easily leave,
and that is why it is proper to wait when they tell you to, and
especially when they tell you not to insist on receiving a response.
Insisting on a response that they do not want to give is a sure
means of being deceived.”
       6) Are all spirits capable of understanding the questions asked
of them?
       “Far from it. Less evolved spirits are incapable of understanding
certain questions, which, however, does not prevent them from
making a good or bad attempt – just like among youselves.”
      In certain cases, when it might be useful, a more enlightened spirit will
      often help a less knowledgeable one by whispering the response to it. This
      may be easily recognized by the contrast of certain responses with others,
      or by the spirit itself confirming it. However, this only applies to sincere
      unknowledgeable spirits and never to those who display false knowledge.



         Questions concerning the Future
      289. 7) Can spirits unveil the future to us?
      “If humans knew the future, they would neglect the present,
and yet this is an issue about which you always insist on obtaining
a precise answer. This should be regarded as a serious error because


                                      399

                             Chapter XXVI


the manifestation of spirits is not a means of fortune-telling. If
you absolutely insist on an answer, however, it will be given by a
frivolous spirit – we are constantly warning you about this.” (See
the Spirits’ Book: Foreknowledge of the Future, no. 868)
        8) Nevertheless, aren’t some future events spontaneously and
correctly announced by spirits?
        “It might happen that the spirit foresees matters that it
considers proper to disclose or that are its mission to reveal to you.
It is in such cases, however, that we should be most concerned with
deceptive spirits, who amuse themselves by making predictions.
You can only judge the degree of confidence they merit by
observing the circumstances as a whole.”
        9) What kinds of predictions should we distrust the most?
        “All which are not of general usefulness. Personal predictions
can nearly always be considered apocryphal.”
        10) For what purpose do spirits spontaneously announce events
that end up not occurring?
        “Most of the time to entertain themselves with the
credulity, fright or elation they cause, and then they laugh at the
disappointment. Sometimes, however, these deceptive predictions
have a serious purpose: to test the persons to whom they are
directed, revealing the nature of the good or evil sentiments they
arouse when received.”
      An example would be an announcement that could arouse greed or
      ambition at the prospect of an inheritance at someone’s death, etc.

       11) Why don’t serious spirits set a specific date when they sense
a particular event will occur? Is it because they can’t or because they
don’t want to?
       “For either reason. In certain cases they might sense the
approach of an event, and then warn you about it. As for the
exact time, they are often not allowed to give it, or many times


                                  400

               Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


they cannot, because they themselves do not know it. A spirit
may foresee an event, but the exact moment might depend on
incidents that have not yet occurred, and which only God knows
about. Frivolous spirits, who have no scruples about fooling you,
set days and hours without caring about the truth. That is why
every circumstantial prediction must be considered suspect.
       “Once more, our mission is to enable you to evolve and
we help you in any way we can. Those who ask high order spirits
for wisdom will never be deceived. However, don’t think you can
waste our time with your futilities and with foretelling the future
for you. We have left that task to frivolous spirits, who amuse
themselves with it like naughty children.
       “Providence has set limits on what can be revealed to humans,
and serious spirits keep quiet about anything they are forbidden
to reveal. All who insist on receiving an answer expose themselves
to the deceptions of low order spirits, who are always ready to take
advantage of opportunities to exploit their gullibility.”
      Spirits see or sense future events through induction. They see them
      occurring within a timeframe that they do not measure as we do. To set
      a specific time for an occurrence, they would have to identify with our
      way of calculating duration, which they do not always deem necessary.
      This is almost always the cause of apparent errors.

       12) Aren’t there individuals who have been gifted with the
special ability to see the future?
       “Yes, those whose soul can disengage itself from matter,
in which case it is their spirit who sees. When appropriate, God
allows them to reveal certain things for good purposes; nonetheless,
imposters and charlatans far outnumber them. This faculty will
become more common in the future, however.”
       13) What about spirits who amuse themselves by telling people
that they are going to die on a certain day at a specific time?


                                   401

                              Chapter XXVI


       “They are pranksters of bad taste – excessive bad taste – who
only want to have fun at the alarm they create. You must never
worry about this.”
       14) But why are certain persons warned by a presentiment
about the time of their death?
       “Most of the time, during its moments of freedom the spirit
itself knows about it and the person retains an intuition upon
awakening. Since these persons have already been prepared, they
are neither frightened nor disturbed by it. For them, this separation
of the soul from the body is only a change of situation, or – if
you prefer a rough example – it is like taking off heavy clothing
and donning silk. The fear of death will decrease at the spread of
Spiritist beliefs.”

         Concerning Past and Future Lives
       290. 15) Can spirits reveal our past lives to us?
       “God sometimes allows them to be revealed, depending on
the objective. If they will aid in your edification and instruction,
these revelations will be authentic, and in such case, they almost
always will occur spontaneously and completely unexpectedly.
However, God never allows it to satisfy idle curiosity.”
       – Why do certain spirits never hesitate to make these revelations?
       “They are pranksters who amuse themselves at your expense.
You should usually regard revelations of this nature as false, or at least
suspect if they do not have an eminently serious and useful purpose.
Mocking spirits have fun by flattering the vanity of persons by
revealing pretentious antecedents. There are mediums and believers
who take what such spirits say at face value in this regard, without even
noticing that the current state of their spirit in no way would justify
the position they believe they had occupied. It is pure vanity, and both
mocking spirits and humans amuse themselves with it. It would be


                                   402

               Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


more logical and in keeping with the progressive evolution of beings
if such people had ascended instead of descended, which would
be more honorable for them. In order to accept these revelations,
it would be necessary for them to have occurred spontaneously
through several mediums who did not know one another, besides the
medium who received them in the first place. Then there would be
reason enough for them to be believed.”
       – If we cannot know about our previous identity, does the same
apply concerning the kind of life we lived, what social position we
occupied, and the qualities and defects that predominated in us?
       “No, this may be revealed because it can serve for your
evolution. However, you yourself may deduce your own past by
studying your present.” (See The Spirits’ Book: Forgetfulness of the
Past, no. 392)
       16) Can we receive any kind of revelation concerning our
future lives?
       “No. Everything that any spirit might tell you regarding your
future would be pure nonsense. You should realize that your future
existence cannot be known beforehand, since it will be determined
by you yourself according to your conduct while on earth and your
resolutions as a spirit afterwards. The less you must expiate, the
happier you will be, but knowing where and how that existence
will be – once again, that is impossible. The only exception is in
the rare and special case of spirits who are on earth only to fulfill
an important mission, for then their course is somewhat traced
out beforehand.

   Concerning Moral and Material Interests
       291. 17) May we request advice from spirits?
       “Yes, of course. Good spirits never refuse to help those who
trustingly evoke them, especially when addressing matters of the


                                  403

                             Chapter XXVI


soul. However, they ignore hypocrites – those who pretend to be
searching for the light while indulging in the darkness.”
       18) Can spirits offer us advice about private affairs?
       “Sometimes, depending on the situation. It also depends
on whom you ask. Advice about one’s private life is more precisely
given by familiar spirits, who are more connected to individuals
and take an interest in their concerns. Your familiar spirit is a
friend, the confidant of your most secret thoughts, but frequently
you weary it with questions that are so trivial that it stays away.
On the other hand, it would be absurd to ask foreign spirits
about intimate problems just like it would be to propose them
to the first person you met on the street. You would do well not
to forget that banal questions are incompatible with high order
spirits. You must also consider the qualities of the familiar spirit,
who may be either good or evil according to the sympathetic
reasons connecting it to the person. The familiar spirit of an evil
individual is an evil spirit, who may offer harmful advice, but
it will withdraw and give way to a better spirit if the individual
improves. Likes attract likes.”
       19) Can our familiar spirits reveal things that may help us in
our material interests?
       “They could, and will sometimes do so, depending on the
circumstances; however, bear in mind that good spirits never render
service to greed. Evil spirits lure you with thousands of images to
excite you, which then deceive you and end up disappointing you.
Also, you should know that if your trial is to suffer this or that
ordeal, protector spirits can help you bear it with more resignation
and sometimes mitigate it, but in the interest of your own future
they cannot free you from it. It is like a good father who does not
give his son everything he wants.”
      In many circumstances, our protector spirits can point out the best
      path for us to follow, but without leading us to it. Otherwise, we


                                  404

                Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


      would lose all initiative and wouldn’t do anything without resorting to
      them, which would be harmful to our evolution. In order to progress,
      humans must continually acquire experiences at their own expense.
      That is why wise spirits counsel us but always hand us over to our own
      abilities like skillful teachers do with their students. In life’s ordinary
      circumstances, they counsel us through inspiration, and thus leave us
      all the merit of our good works, as well as full responsibility for our
      bad choices.

      It would be an abuse of our familiar spirits’ patronage and a
      misunderstanding about their mission if we were to interrogate them
      all the time about the most trivial matters – as certain mediums
      do. Some mediums take up the pencil to get yes/no advice on the
      simplest decisions. This habit reveals both narrow-mindedness and
      the presumption of always having a servant spirit at their orders, who
      has nothing more to do than to concern itself with them and their
      petty interests. It furthermore does away with their own judgment and
      reduces them to playing a passive role without profit in the present
      and, undoubtedly, with certain harm to their future progress. If there
      is childishness in questioning spirits about futile matters, it is also
      infantile on the part of spirits to spontaneously concern themselves
      with what we may call our domestic routine. Such spirits may be good
      but they are certainly still very earthly.

      20) If, upon dying, a certain man left his affairs in turmoil,
could he ask his familiar spirit to help him disentangle them, and
could he question it about the property he has left behind, which may
not be fully known about, provided it is in the interest of justice?
      “You forget that death is liberation from earthly concerns.
Do you think that his spirit, happy with its freedom, will willingly
concern itself any longer with the chain it has just freed itself from
in order to satisfy the greed of heirs, who were perhaps happy
that he died so that they might profit from his death? You speak


                                     405

                                  Chapter XXVI


of justice, but justice is in disappointing the covetousness of the
heirs, which is the beginning of the punishments that God has
reserved for their greed for earthly assets. Moreover, the difficulties
that are sometimes left at the death of a person comprise part of
life’s trials, and no spirit has the power to be free of them, for they
belong to the decrees of God.”
      This response will surely disappoint those who imagine that spirits have
      nothing better to do than to act as our clairvoyant guides and help us not
      in the direction toward heaven but upon earth itself. Another consideration
      supports this response. If certain persons leave their affairs in disarray out of
      neglect during life, it is unlikely that they will be more careful with them after
      death, since they will feel happy to be free of the concerns that caused them.
      Moreover, even if they are little-evolved, they will attach less importance to
      them as spirits than as humans. As for the unknown assets they have left
      behind, there is no reason for them to be concerned about greedy heirs, who
      probably never even thought about them except in the hope of some profit.
      In addition, if they are still imbued with human passions, they might even
      feel a malicious pleasure in their heirs’ disappointment.

      If in the interest of justice and loved ones a spirit deems it useful to
      reveal such assets, it will do so spontaneously without the interested
      parties having to be mediums or resorting to one. It will make the
      matter known through unexpected circumstances, but never due to any
      requests made directly to it, because requests cannot change the nature
      of the trials that the parties must undergo. It would only aggravate them,
      because such requests almost always reveal greed and demonstrate to the
      spirit that its heirs only thought about it for selfish reasons. (See no. 295)



            Concerning the Fate of Spirits
       292. 21) May we ask spirits for information about their
situation in the spirit world?

                                        406

               Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


        “Yes, and they willingly respond when the request is made
out of affinity or the desire to be useful, rather than for the sake
of curiosity.”
        22) Are spirits able to explain the nature of their sufferings or
happiness?
        “Absolutely, and these revelations present you with a
valuable lesson, for they enable you to understand the nature of
future punishments and rewards. By destroying your erroneous
ideas about the subject, they tend to rekindle your faith and trust
in God’s goodness. Good spirits are happy to report on their bliss,
whereas evil ones may be constrained to describe their sufferings
in order to lead them to repent. They sometimes even find some
relief in this. It is the unfortunate who groan in the hope of
obtaining compassion.
        “Don’t forget that the essential and exclusive goal of
Spiritism is your improvement. To reach that goal the Spirits have
received permission to initiate you into the future life, offering
you examples that you may use to your advantage. The more you
identify with the world that awaits you, the less you will suffer in
the one where you now are. This encapsulates the present objective
of Spiritist revelation.”
        23) By evoking persons about whose fate we are uncertain, may
we know whether or not they are still alive?
        “Yes, if the uncertainty about their death is not a necessity or
trial for those who are interested in knowing about it.”
        – If they have died, can they report the circumstances of their
death in a way that can be verified?
        “If it is important, they can; otherwise, they won’t bother.”
      Experience has shown in such cases that a spirit may not at all be
      impressed by our interest as to the circumstances of its death. If it
      wishes to reveal them, it will do so by itself by providing the most
      precise information, whether through a medium or through visions and


                                   407

                                Chapter XXVI


      apparitions. Otherwise, a deceptive spirit can perfectly well take its place
      and amuse itself by providing worthless information.

      The disappearance of individuals, whose deaths cannot be officially
      proven, often creates difficulties in family affairs. Only in rare and
      exceptional cases have we seen spirits provide worthwhile clues when
      questioned. If they wanted to, they no doubt could; however, they are
      almost always forbidden to when the difficulties comprise trials for those
      who would rather avoid them.

      Thus, one would be mistaken to have fanciful hopes of obtaining an
      inheritance by this means, where the sole positive result is the money
      spent on such pursuit.

      There is no lack of spirits who are prepared to encourage such hopes,
      and who have no scruples at all about leading interested parties on a
      futile search, from which they will be happy if they emerge feeling only
      a bit ridiculous.



                      Concerning Health
       293. 24) May spirits offer advice on health?
       “We need our health in order to fulfill our work while on
earth, and that is why spirits willingly concern themselves with it.
However, since there are both ignorant and knowledgeable ones –
in this case as in all others – it is wise not to address the first one
who appears.”
       25) If we address the matter to the spirit of a famous doctor
would we be more certain of obtaining good advice?
       “Famous doctors are not infallible and often have theoretical
ideas that are not always correct, and from which they are not
suddenly freed by death. Earthly science is very insignificant in the
light of heavenly science, and only highly evolved spirits possess


                                      408

               Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


the latter. Even though they may use names you do not know, they
may know much more about everything than your own scholars.
It takes more than science to make spirits highly evolved, and you
would be very surprised at the place certain scholars occupy among
us. Hence, the spirit of a scholar may not know any more than it
did while on earth if it has not progressed as a spirit.”
       26) As spirits, do scholars realize their scientific errors?
       “If they have reached a sufficiently high degree to let go
of their vanity and to understand that their development is not
yet complete, they realize them and confess them without being
ashamed. If they are not sufficiently dematerialized, however, they
may retain some of their earthly prejudices.”
       27) If doctors were to evoke their deceased clients, could they
receive an explanation from them about the cause of their deaths, the
mistakes they might have committed in treating them, and thereby
increase their knowledge?
       “They could, and it would be very useful, especially if they
were assisted by enlightened spirits, who could supplement the
knowledge they lacked concerning certain illnesses. However, it
would be necessary to do such studies in a serious and assiduous
manner and with a humanitarian purpose – not as a means of
acquiring knowledge and wealth without having to work for it.”

    Concerning Inventions and Discoveries
      294. 28) Can spirits provide guidance in scientific research
and discoveries?
      “Science is the work of genius and must only be acquired
through work because that is the only way humans advance
on their path. What would they merit if all they had to do was
question spirits in order to know everything? Any imbecile could
become learned at that price. The same applies to inventions and


                                  409

                               Chapter XXVI


industrial discoveries. Nevertheless, there is another consideration:
each thing must come in its own time, and when minds are
generally mature enough to receive it. If inventors were able to get
answers directly from spirits, they would subvert the natural order
of things and cause fruit to be borne before its proper time.
       “God said to the man and woman, ‘You shall earn your bread
with the sweat of your brow’, an admirable image that outlines
the human condition in this world. Humans must progress in
everything by working for it. If everything were given to them
entirely finished, how would that serve their intelligence? It would
be like a school child whose homework was done by someone else.”
       29) Are scientists and inventors never assisted by spirits in their
research?
       “That’s a different matter altogether. When certain discoveries’
proper time has come, the spirits in charge of directing progress
search for the appropriate persons to accomplish them, inspiring
them with the necessary ideas but leaving them all the merit because
they themselves will have to develop the ideas and carry them out.
This is the process for all the great works of human intelligence.
Good spirits respect all individuals in their own sphere: those who
are capable only of tilling the soil will not be made depositories
of the secrets of God, but spirits will know how to draw out of
obscurity someone who is capable of fulfilling the divine plan. Do
not allow yourselves through curiosity or ambition to be led onto
a path that does not harmonize with the objective of Spiritism and
which would result in the most ridiculous deceptions.”
      A more precise understanding of Spiritism has calmed the fever for
      discoveries which, in its beginning, many individuals prided themselves
      for having made through it. There were people who have even asked
      spirits for recipes on how to dye and restore hair, to heal corns, etc. We
      have seen many who believed that they were about to make a fortune,
      but only reaped results that made them look ridiculous. The same thing


                                     410

                Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


      applies when someone wants to penetrate the mystery of the origin of
      things with the help of spirits. Certain spirits indeed have their own
      theories about it, but they are not any more valuable than those of
      humans and must be received with much caution.



            Concerning Hidden Treasure
      295. 30) Can spirits reveal the whereabouts of hidden treasure?
      “High order spirits do not concern themselves with such
things, but mocking spirits often reveal the whereabouts of non-
existent treasures, or they might even indicate one place while the
actual treasure is in another. Ironically, that has its usefulness in
order to show that true fortune is in labor. If Providence destines
hidden wealth to someone, that person will find it naturally and
not by some other means.”
      31) What about the belief in spirits who guard hidden treasure?
      “Spirits who are not yet dematerialized attach themselves to
things. Misers who have hid their treasure may still watch over it
and guard it after death. Their perplexity at seeing it stolen is one
of their punishments until they understand the futility of such
things. However, there are also spirits on the earth in charge of
guiding its geological transformations, and who have allegorically
been transformed into guardians of natural treasures.”
      The issue of hidden treasure is the same as that involving unknown
      inheritance. Someone would have to be insane to count on the feigned
      revelations that can come from the scoundrels of the invisible world. We
      have already stated that when spirits want to or are able to make such
      revelations, they do so spontaneously and do not require mediums. Here
      is an example:

      A lady lost her husband after thirty years of marriage and was threatened
      with being expelled from her home without resources by her step-


                                    411

                              Chapter XXVI


      sons, for whom she had been like a second mother. She was extremely
      desperate and one night her husband appeared to her and invited her to
      follow him into his office. There he showed her his writing desk, which
      was still sealed shut, and providing her with second sight, he showed
      her what was inside. He pointed out a secret drawer that she had not
      known about and explained how it worked, adding, “I foresaw what
      is happening and wanted to assure you of your inheritance. My will
      is in this drawer and I have left you the full use of this house and an
      income of…. ” Then, he disappeared. When the day arrived to remove
      the judicial seals, no one could open the drawer. The lady then told
      what had happened. She opened the drawer according to her husband’s
      instructions and found that the will conformed to what he had said.



               Concerning Other Worlds
        296. 32) How far can we trust spirits’ descriptions of other
worlds?
        “It depends on the true evolutionary degree of the spirits
who provide them, for you must understand that ordinary spirits
are as incapable of informing you about this matter as an unlearned
person would be among you concerning the various countries of
the earth. You often ask scientific questions about such worlds,
which these spirits cannot answer. If they mean well, they address
the issue according to their personal ideas. If they are frivolous, they
have fun at providing you with bizarre and fantastic descriptions
drawn from their own imagination and report on many matters
that have nothing real about them. They are as imaginative in
their discarnate state as they were on earth. Nonetheless, don’t
believe it is completely impossible to obtain information about
other worlds. Good spirits love to describe the ones they inhabit
in order to provide instruction to help you evolve and to place
you on the path that will lead you to them. It is a way for them to

                                   412

                Questions That May Be Addressed to Spirits


concentrate your ideas concerning the future and not to leave you
in a vacuum.”
       – How can we be sure about the accuracy of these descriptions?
       “The best means is their agreement amongst themselves,
but you must remember that they have your moral improvement
as their goal. Thus, it is concerning the moral state of the
inhabitants, about whom they can best inform you and not the
physical or geological structure of those globes. With your current
understanding you could not comprehend it anyway. Knowing
about such structure would not help your progress in this world,
and you will be fully capable of it when you are there some day.”
      Questions about the physical composition and the astronomical
      conditions of worlds involve the field of scientific research, and spirits will
      not spare us any work on the subject. Otherwise, a particular astronomer
      would find it very convenient to ask spirits to make calculations for
      him, which afterwards he would undoubtedly not admit had happened.
      If through revelation spirits could spare someone some work on a
      particular discovery, they would probably do so for a scholar who was
      sufficiently modest to acknowledge the source openly and not for the
      benefit of those who are proud, who would deny spirits’ involvement
      and for whom, to the contrary, they often reserve the disappointments
      of self-centeredness.

          Contradictions and
             Deceptions
                       Contradictions
       297. The opponents of Spiritism do not hesitate to point
out that its adherents do not agree amongst themselves, that not
all even share the same beliefs; in other words, they contradict one
another. If the teaching is given by spirits, they ask, why aren’t they
identical? Only a serious and in-depth study of the Science can
expose these arguments for what they really are.
       We will begin by stating that these contradictions, which
certain individuals make such a big noise about, are usually more
apparent than real, and that they refer more to the surface than to
the depth of the issue, and that is why they are of no importance.
These contradictions proceed from two sources: humans and spirits.
       298. The contradictions of human origin have been
sufficiently explained in the chapter Theories, no. 36. One should
understand that in the beginning, while the observations were
yet incomplete, different opinions arose about the causes and


                                 415

                            Chapter XXVII


consequences of spirit phenomena, and that three fourths of these
opinions have fallen before a more serious and in-depth study.
With few exceptions, and apart from certain individuals who
have not easily broken from ideas they have either nourished or
engendered, we can now state that there has been a unification of
the vast majority of Spiritists, at least as to the general principles –
except perhaps for a few insignificant details.
        299. To understand the cause and worth of the contradictions
of spirit origin, we must identify with the nature of the invisible
world by having studied all its various aspects. At first glance, it
may seem strange that spirits do not all think alike, but this will
come as no surprise to anyone who knows about the infinite
number of degrees that they must traverse before they reach the
top of the scale. To expect a single view of matters we would have
to suppose them to be all at the same level. To think that they all
should see things correctly would be to believe that all had reached
perfection, which has neither happened nor could happen when
we remind ourselves that they are nothing more than humanity
minus the corporeal envelope. Since spirits of all degrees can
manifest, their communications bear the stamp of their ignorance
or knowledge, their moral inferiority or superiority. It is precisely
for distinguishing between the true and the false, the good and the
evil, that our instructions up to this point have been provided.
        We must remember that there are pseudo-scholar and
semi-scholar, proud, presumptuous and theoretical spirits, just
as among humans. Since only pure spirits know everything,
for the rest – as for us – there are mysteries that they explain in
their own way, according to their own ideas, and about which
they can form correct or erroneous opinions. Out of vanity they
want these opinions to prevail and they love to repeat them in
their communications. The error lies in the attitude of some
of their interpreters, who rashly espouse opinions that violate

                                  416

                     Contradictions and Deceptions


common sense and regard themselves as solely responsible for
divulging them. Thus, the contradictions of spirit origin arise
from by the natural diversity of intelligence, knowledge, ability
to judge and morality of certain spirits who are not yet capable of
understanding and comprehending everything. (See The Spirits’
Book, Introduction, sect. XIII, and Conclusion, sect. IX)
       300. Some persons might ask what the use of good spirits’
teachings is if they do not offer us a greater degree of certainty than
those of humans. The response is simple. We do not accept the
teachings of all humans with the same confidence, and between
two doctrines we prefer the one whose author seems the more
enlightened, capable, judicious and least subject to the passions.
We must regard spirits in the same way. Even though some are
not above humanity, there are many who have surpassed it, and
they can provide us with information that we would seek for in
vain amongst the most educated men and women. We must learn
how to distinguish them from the crowd of low order spirits if we
want to become enlightened, and it is this distinction that leads
to an in-depth understanding of Spiritism. Even this information
has its limits, however. If it has not been given to spirits to know
everything, even less has it been given to humans; therefore, there
are subjects about which we would ask spirits in vain, either because
they must not inform us about them, or because they themselves
do not understand them and can therefore only give us their own
personal opinion. These personal opinions are what proud spirits
state as absolute truths. It is especially regarding matters that must
remain secret, such as the future and the beginning of things,
which such spirits most insist on in order to give the impression
that they know the secrets of God. This is also where we can find
most contradictions. (See preceding chapter)
       301. Following are the responses given by the Spirits to our
questions concerning contradictions:

                                 417

                              Chapter XXVII


        1) Can the same spirit, communicating at two different Spiritist
Centers, transmit contradictory opinions on the same subject?
        “If the two Centers differ as to ideas and opinions, the
communication may be distorted, because they are under the
influence of different ranks of spirits. In that case, it is not the
communication itself that is contradictory, but the way in which
it is transmitted.”
        2) We can understand that an answer may be altered, but when
the character of the medium excludes any possibility of evil influence, how
can high order spirits use diverse and contradictory language concerning
the same subject and with individuals who are completely serious?
        “Truly high order spirits never contradict one another.
Their language is always the same with the same individuals, but
it may vary according to place and person. Therefore, note this
well: contradiction is often only apparent; it is more related to
words than to ideas; thus, upon reflection one can see that the
fundamental idea is still the same. What is more, the same spirit
may respond differently concerning the same question, depending
on how highly evolved the evokers are. It is not always proper
for all to receive the same response, because not all are equally
advanced. It would be like a child and a scholar asking you the
same question – you would obviously respond to each in a way
that will enable each to understand and be satisfied with the
answer. In this case, even though the answers are different in form,
they would have the same essential meaning.”
        3) Why is it that when serious spirits are with certain individuals
they seem to accept ideas and even prejudices that they warn against
when they are with others?
        “We must make ourselves understood. If someone has
a well-established conviction about some doctrine, even if
erroneous, we must lead them away from it – but little by little.
That is why we often employ their own terms and seem to go


                                   418

                     Contradictions and Deceptions


along with their ideas, so that they do not suddenly take offense
and stop learning from us.
       “Moreover, it is not proper to sharply attack preconceptions,
which would be a good way for us not to be listened to. This is
why spirits often speak in terms of the opinions of those who listen
to them: in order to gradually try to lead them to the truth. They
adapt their language to these people as you would do if you were
a skilful speaker. That is also why they will not speak to a Chinese
person or a Muslim in the same way they would to a French person
or a Christian – they would obviously be rejected.
       “One should not see as a contradiction what it is usually
only a developmental phase of truth. All spirits have their
mission assigned by God, and they accomplish it according to the
conditions they consider proper for benefiting those who receive
their communications.”
       4) Even apparent contradictions can cast doubt in the minds
of certain persons. What method should we use in order to recognize
the truth?
       “In order to discern error from truth, one must delve into
the understanding of our responses by carefully and seriously
meditating on them. A true study must be made of them, which
requires as much time as other studies do.
       “Study, compare and meditate upon the issues. We have
constantly affirmed that knowing the truth has its price. How
could you expect to reach the truth by interpreting everything
according to your own narrow-minded ideas, but which you
consider so great? The day is not far off, however, when the Spirits’
teachings will be uniform not only in their details but also in their
main aspects. Their mission is to destroy error, but this can only
occur gradually.”
       5) There are persons who have neither the time nor the ability
required for a serious and in-depth study, and they accept whatever is


                                 419

                           Chapter XXVII


taught them without examining it. Wouldn’t that put them at risk to
believe in error?
       “Practicing goodness and not evil is what is essential –
there are not two separate doctrines for that. Goodness is always
goodness, whether done in the name of Allah or Yahweh, because
there is only one same God for the universe.”
       6) How can spirits who seem to be intellectually evolved
entertain obviously erroneous ideas about certain matters?
       “They have their own doctrines. Those who are not very
advanced, but who think they are, hold their ideas to be the truth.
The same thing happens amongst you.”
       7) What about doctrines that only accept communications from
one spirit in particular such as God or Jesus?
       “A spirit who teaches this wants to dominate, and therefore
imposes itself as the only one. However, the unfortunate spirit
who dares to assume the name of God will pay dearly for its pride.
Such doctrines refute themselves, because they contradict the most
widely verified facts. They are unworthy of serious consideration,
because they lack foundation.
       “Reason itself tells you that good proceeds from a good
source, and evil from an evil source. Would you expect a good
tree to produce bad fruit? Have you ever picked grapes from an
apple tree? The diversity of the communications is obvious proof
of the diversity of their origin. In fact, spirits who want to be the
only ones to communicate fail to mention why others cannot do
so. Their pretentiousness is the denial of what is most beautiful
and consoling about Spiritism, i.e., the relations of the visible and
invisible worlds, and of men and women with their loved ones,
who would otherwise be lost to them forever. These very relations
are what identify men and women with their future, and which
detach them from the material world. Suppressing these relations
would plunge them into the torment of doubt and would feed


                                420

                     Contradictions and Deceptions


their selfishness. If you were to examine the doctrine of these
spirits, you would find unjustifiable contradictions at every step,
proofs of their ignorance regarding the most obvious things, and
thus sure signs that they are little-evolved.”
                                                 The Spirit Truth

        8) Of all the notable contradictions in spirit communications,
one of the most striking concerns reincarnation. If reincarnation is a
necessity of spirit life, why don’t all spirits teach it?
        “Don’t you realize that there are spirits whose ideas are
as limited with regards to the present as are those of many
individuals on the earth? They believe that their current situation
must last forever; thus, they do not look beyond the circle of their
immediate perceptions, nor do they worry about where they have
come from, or where they are going; they are, nonetheless, subject
to the law of necessity. Reincarnation is a necessity they do not
think about while it is not happening to them at the moment.
They know very well that the spirit progresses, but how? That is a
conundrum for them. So, if you ask them about it, they will talk
about the seven heavens superimposed on one another like the
stories of a building. There are even some who will talk about ‘the
sphere of fire’, the ‘sphere of stars’, the ‘sphere of flowers’ or the
‘sphere of the elect’.”
        9) We understand that little-advanced spirits cannot
comprehend this issue, but why then are there spirits who are obviously
little-advanced both morally and intellectually, but who spontaneously
talk about their various existences and their desire to reincarnate in
order to expiate their past?
        “Things happen in the spirit world which are difficult for
you to understand. Don’t you know individuals who are ignorant
about certain matters but knowledgeable about others, who have
more discernment than education, and others who have more wit


                                 421

                             Chapter XXVII


than discernment? Don’t you also realize that certain spirits like
to keep humans in ignorance, and to do so tout themselves as
teachers, taking advantage of the ease with which their words are
accepted? They seduce those who do not examine matters deeply,
but when they are exposed to the light of reason, they do not keep
up their charade for very long.
       “Furthermore, you must take into account the overall
prudence of the Spirits in the propagation of the truth. A light that
is too strong and sudden is blinding, not enlightening. Thus, in
certain cases they may deem it proper to spread the truth gradually,
depending on the time, place and individuals. Moses did not teach
everything that Christ would teach later, and Christ himself said
many things that would only be understood by future generations.
You speak of reincarnation and wonder why it has not been taught
in certain countries. You must realize, however, that in a country
dominated by color prejudices and with slavery deeply rooted in
its customs, Spiritism would be rejected for the simple fact that
is proclaims reincarnation. The idea that a master might become
a slave – and vice versa – would appear outrageous. Wouldn’t it
be more worthwhile at first to accept the general idea, leaving its
consequences for later? Oh, people! How short-sighted you are
in appreciating the designs of God! Know, then, that nothing is
done without God’s permission and without a purpose that you
often cannot fathom. I have already told you that Spiritist belief
will become unified – you can be certain of it. The disharmonies
are already less profound, and will be erased little by little as men
and women become enlightened, and will disappear completely
because it is God’s will, against which no error can prevail.”
                                                   The Spirit Truth

       10) Don’t the erroneous doctrines taught by certain spirits retard
the progress of the true Science?


                                  422

                      Contradictions and Deceptions


       “You want everything to be problem-free, but you must
remember that there is no such thing as a field without weeds,
which must be uprooted by the farmer. These erroneous doctrines
are a result of the low order of your world. If humans were perfect,
they would accept only the truth. Errors are like fake gemstones
that only a trained eye can detect. Thus, you need training to
distinguish the true from the false. Well then, erroneous doctrines
have the purpose of enabling you to separate truth from error.”
       – Don’t those who accept error hinder their own progress?
       “If they accept error, it is because they are not yet sufficiently
advanced to comprehend the truth.”
       302. While awaiting unification, each one believes he or she
possesses the sole truth, a delusion that deceptive spirits never cease to
exploit. Upon what can impartial and disinterested individuals base
their judgment?
       “The purest light cannot be obscured by any cloud. The
flawless diamond is the most valuable. Therefore, judge spirits by
the purity of their teachings. There will be unity where good has
never mixed with evil. That is where humans will be connected by
the very force of the circumstances, for they will realize that is where
the truth is to be found. Notice that the fundamental principles
are the same everywhere, and they must unite you in one common
thought: the love of God and the practice of goodness. No matter
what path of progress is intended for souls, the final objective is
the same, as well as the means to reach it: practicing goodness;
there are not two different ways of doing so. If crucial differences
arise regarding the very foundation of the Doctrine, you have a
sure rule for appraising them. That rule is this: the best doctrine
is the one that best satisfies the heart and the reason, and has the
most resources for leading men and women toward righteousness.
I can assuredly tell you, that is the one which shall prevail.”
                                                      The Spirit Truth

                                Chapter XXVII


      The following causes can give rise to contradictions in spirit
      communications: the ignorance of certain spirits; the cunning of little-
      evolved spirits who out of malice or evil state the opposite of what was
      said by some other spirit, whose name they have usurped; the will of the
      spirit itself, who speaks according to time, place and persons, and who
      may deem it proper not to say everything to everybody; the insufficiency
      of human language for expressing the matter of the incorporeal world;
      the insufficiency of the means of communication, which do not always
      enable a spirit to express its entire thought; and finally, the interpretation
      that each individual may give to a word or explanation according to his
      or her own ideas, preconceptions or point of view regarding the subject.
      Only study, observation, experience and the absence of all vanity can
      teach us how to distinguish these various elements.



                              Deceptions
       303. If being mistaken is unpleasant, it is even worse
being deceived. Moreover, it is an inconvenience from which we
can easily protect ourselves. The means for exposing the traps set
by deceptive spirits have been set forth in previous instructions,
and that is why we will say but little here regarding the matter.
Following are what the Spirits have said about it:
       1) Deceptions are one of the most disagreeable stumbling blocks
of practical Spiritism. Is there any way to avoid them?
       “It seems to me that you can find your answer by referring to
what you have already learned. Yes, there is of course a very simple
method, which is not to ask of Spiritism anything more than
what it can and must give you – its goal is the moral perfection of
humankind. As long as you hold to this, you will never be deceived,
because there are not two different ways of understanding moral
truth, but rather only that one which every man and woman of
common sense can accept.

                                      424

                     Contradictions and Deceptions


        “The Spirits have come to teach you and guide you along
the path of morality and not the path of fame and fortune, or to
attend to your petty passions. If you never made needless requests
of them, or those beyond their prerogatives, none of you would
open yourselves up to deceptive spirits. Thus, we may conclude
that the only one who is deceived is the one who deserves it.
        “The Spirits are not charged with teaching you about the
things of this world, but with guiding you securely in what will
be useful to you in the other. When they address the issues of this
world, it is because they deem it necessary, and not because you
request it. If you see spirits as substitutes for fortune tellers and
spell casters, then you will be deceived.
        “If all humans had to do was to address spirits in order to know
everything, they would lose their free will and be outside the designs
traced out by God for humankind. Humans must act on their own.
God does not send spirits to make straight the path of their material
life, but to prepare them for the path of the future life.”
        – However, there are persons who ask for nothing and are
nonetheless terribly duped by spirits who manifest spontaneously
without having been evoked.
        “They ask for nothing, but they accept what such spirits
say – which amounts to the same thing. If they would distrust
anything outside the essential objective of Spiritism, frivolous
spirits would not deceive them so easily.”
        2) Why does God allow sincere individuals who trustingly
accept Spiritism to be deceived? Couldn’t this lead to them giving up
their belief?
        “If they gave up their belief for that reason, it would be
because their faith was not very solid in the first place. Persons who
would abandon Spiritism because of a simple deception would
show that they had not understood it, and that they had missed its
main point. God allows deception in order to test the perseverance


                                  425

                              Chapter XXVII


of true adherents and to punish those who use Spiritism simply as
a means of entertainment.”
                                               The Spirit Truth

      The cunningness of deceptive spirits sometimes surpasses anything
      we could possibly imagine. The artfulness with which they erect their
      weaponry and plot ways of being persuasive would deserve attention
      even if they were limited to innocent pranks. However, deceptions can
      lead to unpleasant consequences for those who are not prepared. We are
      very fortunate for having been able in time to open the eyes of many
      persons who have asked us for advice, saving them from difficult and
      compromising situations. Among the methods used by these spirits we
      should put in first place as being the most frequent those that excite
      greed, such as the revelation of vast buried treasures, the announcement
      of inheritances and other sources of wealth. We must also regard as
      suspect predictions with set dates and all precise indications regarding
      material interests. We should take all care with arrangements prescribed
      or advised by spirits when the purpose is not clearly reasonable. We
      must never allow ourselves to be dazzled by the names assumed by
      spirits to give validity to their words. We must distrust audacious
      theories and systems, and, finally, we should distrust everything outside
      the moral objective of manifestations. We could write an entire volume
      about the most curious stories involving all the deceptions that have
      come to our attention.

 Charlatanism and Trickery
         • Mediums for Hire • Fraudulent Manifestations



                     Mediums for Hire
        304. Since anything can be exploited, it is no wonder that
there are persons who want to exploit spirits. It remains to know how
spirits would take it if such an attempt were made on them. We may
state from the start that nothing lends itself better to charlatanism
and trickery than such an occupation. Since there are many more
fake mediums than somnambulists, this simple fact in itself is a basis
for distrust. On the other hand, unprofitableness is the best response
to those who only see the phenomena as clever tricks – there is no
such thing as non-profit charlatanism. What reason would persons
have for practicing deceit without profit, especially if their recognized
trustworthiness places them above suspicion?
        If mediums’ use of their faculty for monetary gain raises
suspicions about mediums in general, it does not prove that such
suspicions have any foundation. They may truly have the faculty
and still act in good faith, although expecting to get paid. In that
case, let us see if it is possible to expect a satisfactory result.


                                  427

                            Chapter XXVIII


        305. If someone has really understood what we have stated
about the conditions required to serve as interpreters for good
spirits, the multiple causes that can repel them, the circumstances
which, apart from the spirits’ will, might be obstacles to their
manifestation, and, finally, all the conditions of a moral nature
that can influence communications, how could he or she believe
that a spirit, even if it is of the lowest order, would at all times be
under the orders of paid mediums and be subject to their demands
to answer to the curiosity of the first inquisitor who came along?
If we understand the aversion good spirits hold for anything that
has the smell of avarice and selfishness about it, and the little
importance they attach to material matters, how could we possibly
believe that they would help those who intend to make a business
of their manifestations? The idea is repugnant to reason, and one
would have to know next to nothing about the nature of the spirit
world to accept such a thing. However, since frivolous spirits are
less scrupulous and look for occasions to amuse themselves at our
expense, it might be that if we are not fooled by a fake medium,
it is still quite possible to be fooled by some of these spirits. These
simple considerations provide us with a measure of confidence to
be given to these types of communication, but why resort to paid
mediums nowadays if the faculty may be found among family
members, friends and acquaintances at no cost, if we ourselves do
not possess it?
      306. Mediums for hire are not only those who ask for
payment. Such self-interest does not always appear as ambition for
material profit, but also as a pretence of any kind that may support
personal desires. This is one of the weaknesses that mocking spirits
know very well how to exploit, skillfully and astutely taking
advantage of it and lulling those who fall under their influence into
deceptive illusion. In sum: mediumship is granted for practicing
the good, and the good spirits withdraw from anyone who intends

                                 428

                       Charlatanism and Trickery


to transform it into a means for reaching anything contrary to the
designs of Providence. Selfishness is the scourge of society, and
good spirits strive against it constantly; therefore, one should never
suppose that spirits would ever want to aid it. This is so reasonable
that it would be needless to insist on the matter.
       307. Physical effects mediums belong to another category.
Such effects are usually produced by low order spirits with fewer
scruples. This does not imply that these spirits are necessarily
evil, however – a person may be simply a porter but yet be very
honest. Mediums of this type, who desired to exploit their faculty,
could easily find a spirit to assist them without much hesitation.
However, even in this case there is a problem. Physical effects
mediums, like those who provide intellectual communications,
have received their ability for good purposes and not for their
own personal satisfaction. If they abuse it, they could lose it or be
harmed by it because, in reality, less evolved spirits are under the
orders of highly evolved ones.
       Little-evolved spirits love to deceive but they themselves do
not like to be deceived. Even though they may spontaneously share
in the games and caprices of curiosity because they enjoy amusing
themselves, they dislike being exploited or serving as accomplices
in money making. Moreover, they are always proving they have
their own will, and that they act however and whenever it seems
best to them, which renders physical effects mediums even less
certain of the regularity of manifestations than writing mediums.
Intending to produce them on certain days and at certain times
would show profound ignorance. So what can they do to ensure
money? Fraudulently simulate the phenomena. That is what some
may resort to, not only those who accept such an occupation, but
also even apparently simple individuals who think it is a much
easier way to make a living than having to work for it. If an actual
spirit doesn’t produce anything, they make up for it in other ways –

                                 429

                             Chapter XXVIII


the imagination is very fertile when it comes to making money!
Since required payment is a legitimate motive for suspicion, that
in itself is justification for strict examination, which should offend
no one without justifying such suspicion. However, this suspicion
is as legitimate in cases of payment as it is offensive in relation to
honorable and disinterested individuals.
       308. Even when restricted to physical manifestations,
mediumship has not been granted for putting on shows. Those
who think that spirits are under their orders for public exhibition
may rightly be suspected of charlatanism or skillful sleight-of-
hand. Let us always remember this when we see adds for Spiritist
or spiritualist séances with paid admission, and remember what we
will get when attending these shows.
       From everything we have said, we may conclude that
absolute disinterestedness in profit is the best guarantee against
charlatanism, for if it does not always ensure the veracity of intelligent
communications, it at least deprives evil spirits of a powerful means
of action and shuts the mouths of certain detractors.
      309. We will now briefly address amateur trickery, i.e.
the innocent fraud of certain pranksters. This deception may be
practiced as entertainment at unimportant and frivolous meetings,
but never in serious gatherings that only admit honest persons.
Someone may derive pleasure from momentary trickery, but he or
she would have to be strangely patient to keep up such a role for
months and years, and each time for long hours in a row. Only
some kind of profit could lead someone to persevere for so long,
and profit, we will repeat, should immediately arouse suspicion.
       310. One might argue that mediums cannot donate
all their time to the public in the interest of Spiritism, because
they too need to make a living. However, is it in the interest of
Spiritism or in their own interest that they donate their time? And


                                   430

                        Charlatanism and Trickery


mightn’t they anticipate it, before anything, as a possible lucrative
occupation? Dedicated people can always be found at a price. Do
they have only this occupation at their disposal? We mustn’t forget
that whether they are of a high order or a low order, spirits are the
souls of the dead. If morality and religion obligate us to respect
their physical remains, then there is an even greater obligation to
respect their spirits.
       What would we say about someone who dug up a corpse in
order to display it for money because it was capable of arousing
curiosity? Would it be any less disrespectful to display the spirit
than the body under the pretext of being curious to see how the
spirit acts? And we should note that the price for a seat will reflect
the scope of the tricks and the attractiveness of the show. Even if
during its lifetime a spirit had been a comedian, it would certainly
not suspect that after death it would encounter an entrepreneur who
would make it perform for free while he or she made a profit from it.
       We must remember that both physical and intelligent
manifestations are only permitted by God for our instruction.
       311. In spite of these moral considerations, we of course
cannot deny the possibility that there are paid mediums who are
honest and conscientious, since there are honest individuals in all
occupations. We are only addressing abuse. Nonetheless, we must
agree that, for the reasons we have given, there is more likelihood
for abuse among paid mediums than among those who consider
their faculty as a gift and use it only to serve others.
       Besides the circumstances, the degree of trust or distrust that we
concede to paid mediums depends more than anything else on their
character and morality. Mediums who have a serious and eminently
useful purpose, but who are prevented from using their time in
another activity, are for this reason exempt from other obligations
and cannot be confused with speculating mediums, who have pre-
meditatively made mediumship a business. Therefore, according to

                                  431

                            Chapter XXVIII


the motive and the purpose, spirits may condemn, absolve or even
favor them. They judge the intent more than the material fact.
       312. The same considerations do not apply to somnambulists
who utilize their faculty for profit. Although this exploitation is
also subject to abuse, and unprofitableness comprises the greatest
guarantee of sincerity, their situation is different because it is their
own spirit who acts and, consequently, is always at their disposal.
Actually, they only willfully exploit themselves because they are free
to use their own faculties as they please, whereas speculative mediums
exploit the souls of the dead. (See no. 172, Somnambulistic Mediums)
       313. We are quite aware that our severity regarding mediums
for hire sets us against all who exploit or intend to exploit this
new business, making them, as well as their friends who follow
their opinion, our staunch enemies. We may console ourselves by
recalling that the money-changers who were expelled from the
temple by Jesus could hardly have looked upon him with much
favor. We are also faced with individuals who do not regard the
matter with proper seriousness. Nevertheless, we feel we have the
right to have and express our opinion. We would not try to force it
on anybody. If the majority have adopted it, however, it is because
they have apparently found it to be appropriate. At any rate, we do
not see how anyone could prove that there is less possibility for fraud
and abuse in speculation than in unprofitableness. On our part, if
our writings have contributed to casting doubt on mediumship for
hire in France and other countries, we believe that it will not be one
of the least services they have rendered to serious Spiritism.

              Fraudulent Manifestations
     314. Those who do not accept the reality of the physical
manifestations usually attribute them to fraud or special effects.


                                  432

                       Charlatanism and Trickery


They start with the principle that skillful illusionists can do things
that seem miraculous to those who do not know their tricks.
Hence, they conclude that mediums are mere schemers. We have
already refuted this argument or opinion, particularly in our
articles about Mr. Home and in the January and February 1858
issues of Revue Espirite. We will therefore only say a few words on
the matter before addressing a more serious topic.
        There is one consideration that will not escape anyone who
reflects on the matter a little. There are undoubtedly illusionists
of amazing skill, but they are rare. If all mediums practice sleight-
of-hand, we would have to agree that this art has made enormous
progress in a short amount of time and has suddenly become very
well known, since it may be found to be an innate ability among
persons who have never suspected it – even children.
        Does the fact that there are charlatans who sell their snake oil
in public and even doctors who privately abuse their clients’ trust
mean that all doctors are charlatans or that the medical class has
lost it respectability? Does the fact that there are persons who sell
colored water as wine mean that all who sell wine are adulterators,
and that there is no such thing as pure wine? Anything can be
abused – even the most respectable – and we may state that there
is also genius in fraud. However, fraud always has some purpose,
some material interest. When nothing can be gained from it, there
is no interest in it. That is why we have stated that, regarding paid
mediums, the best of all guarantees is absolute unprofitableness.
      315. Of all the spirit phenomena, those that are most
susceptible to fraud are the ones involving physical effects, for
reasons we must now consider. First, they are directed more
toward sight than intelligence and are therefore most easily
imitated by sleight-of-hand. Second, they arouse more curiosity
than the others, are more appropriate for attracting crowds, and,
consequently, they are more fruitful. From this double point of

                                  433

                           Chapter XXVIII


view, it is easy to see why charlatans are so interested in imitating
these manifestations. Since most spectators are unfamiliar with
science, they are generally more interested in entertainment than
serious instruction, and we know that entertainment always
pays better than instruction. There is a more decisive reason
to consider, however. Sleight-of-hand can imitate physical
effects and only requires dexterity, but so far it has not been
gifted with improvisation, which requires an uncommon dose
of intelligence, and it cannot therefore produce those beautiful
and sublime sayings that spirits normally provide during their
communications, and which are frequently so apropos. This
reminds us of the following occurrence.
       A literary gentleman came to see us one day and said that
he was a qualified intuitive writing medium, and that he was
available to the Spiritist Society. Since it was the Society’s policy
not to accept mediums whose abilities we were unsure of, we
asked the visitor first to come to a private meeting to provide us
with evidence of his faculty. He actually came to the meeting,
where several mediums were either writing spirit dissertations or
responding with remarkable precision to questions asked of them
or about issues on unknown topics. When the visitor’s turn came,
he wrote some meaningless words, said that he was not feeling
well that day, and we never saw him again. He undoubtedly found
that the role of an intelligent effects medium was more difficult to
enact than he had thought.
      316. In all matters, the persons who are easiest to deceive
are the ones who do not belong to the trade, and the same applies
to Spiritism. Those who are unfamiliar with it are easily fooled by
appearances, whereas a preliminary and careful study, not only of
the causes of the phenomena but also the normal conditions in
which they may be produced, would initiate them into the subject
and furnish them the means of recognizing fraud.

       317. Fraudulent mediums are justifiably stigmatized in the
following letter, which we have reproduced from the August, 1861
issue of Revue Spirite.
       Paris, July 21, 1861
       Dear Sir:
       One may disagree on certain points and thoroughly agree on
others. I have just finished reading some considerations on page
213 of the last issue of your magazine concerning fraud involving
issues of spiritual (or Spiritist) experiments, considerations to
which I am happy to have fully dedicated myself. Consequently, all
confusion about theoretical and doctrinal matters has disappeared
as if by magic.
       I am perhaps not as severe as you are with regard to
mediums who worthily and properly accept remuneration to
make up for time dedicated to experiments, which are often long
and tiring. However, I am as severe as you – and it is impossible
not to be – with regard to those who resort to deception and fraud
to compensate for when the promised and hoped-for results are
absent or insufficient. (See no. 311)
       Mixing truth and error when dealing with phenomena
precipitated by the intervention of spirits is simply disgraceful,
and a medium would have absolutely no moral sense in thinking
that he or she could do so without scruples. As you have observed
perfectly, it casts doubt over the matter in the minds of the indecisive
once fraud is recognized. I would add that it most deplorably
compromises honorable individuals who lend the disinterested
support of their knowledge and understanding to such mediums,
and who have become trusting patrons by sponsoring them in
some way. Such an act is committing a true abuse of authority.
       All mediums who have been caught in the act of fraud –
or if I may use a slightly trivial expression “with their hand in
the cookie jar” – deserve to be stigmatized by all spiritualists


                                  435

or Spiritists everywhere. It is their strict duty to unmask and
expose them.
     If you think it proper to print these few lines in your
magazine, they are at your disposal.
     Sincerely,
     Matthew
       318. All spirit phenomena are not equally easy to imitate.
There are some that obviously defy every skill of illusion –
particularly those involving the movement of objects without
contact, the suspension of heavy objects in the air, raps heard in
several places at once, apparitions, etc. – except by trickery and
collusion. That is why we have stated that, in such a case, one must
attentively observe the circumstances, and, especially, take into
account the character and situation of the persons involved, as well
as their objective and interest in being deceptive. This is the best of
all controls because there are circumstances that remove all reason
for suspicion. Therefore, we think one should at first distrust
whoever makes a spectacle or object of curiosity and amusement
of these phenomena, or whoever claims to produce them at will
and at the appointed time – as we have already explained. We
can never repeat too often that the concealed intelligences who
manifest can be offended, and want to show us they also have free
will and are not subject to our whims. (See no. 38)
       It is enough for us to point out a few subterfuges employed, or
which may be employed in certain cases for good faith observers to
guard against. It would be a waste of time to try and dissuade those
who insist on passing judgment without having delved into the matter.
      319. A common phenomenon is that of raps produced
within the wood, and which may or may not be accompanied
by movements of the table or other objects being used. It is one
of the easiest effects to imitate either with foot contact or by


                                 436

                      Charlatanism and Trickery


causing the furniture to produce small crackling noises within
it. However, there is a special little maneuver that one should
be forewarned about. The hands can be placed close together
flat on the table so that the thumbnails forcefully support each
other. Then, by an entirely imperceptible muscular movement a
dry noise can be produced that is quite similar to inner typtology.
The noise reverberates within the wood, producing a complete
illusion. Nothing is easier to simulate – as many raps as required,
a drumbeat, etc. – than responding to certain questions with a yes
or no, with numbers or even letters of the alphabet.
       Once forewarned, however, it is very easy to recognize the
fraud, which is not possible if the hands are far apart from each
other, and if we are sure that no other contact can produce the
noise. Moreover, true raps display the characteristic of changing
places and tone at will, which cannot occur when produced by
the cause we have indicated or any other similar one. Thus, they
may jump from the table to some other piece of furniture not
touched by anyone, the walls, the ceiling, etc., and also respond to
unforeseen questions. (See no. 41)
       320. Direct writing is even easier to imitate. Without
mentioning well-known chemical agents that make writing appear
at a given time on a white sheet of paper (which can be foiled
with ordinary precautions), this ruse can also occur through a
skillful sleight-of-hand, wherein one sheet is replaced by another.
Furthermore, the defrauder may distract one’s attention while
quickly writing a few words. Some have even been known to write
with a small pencil lead hidden in the fingernail.
     321. Apportations also lend themselves to sleight-of-hand.
One can easily be deceived by a more or less dexterous – even
unprofessional – magician. In no. 96 above, we stated that spirits
themselves determine the exceptional conditions under which these


                                437

                           Chapter XXVIII


appearances can occur so that we may conclude that any willful
and easy obtainment should at least be considered suspicious. The
same applies to direct writing.
      322. In the chapter on Special Mediums we mentioned
what the Spirits regard as both common and rare mediumistic
aptitudes. One may properly distrust mediums who intend to easily
precipitate either apportations or direct writing, or who aspire to
display multiple abilities – claims that are rarely justifiable.
       323. Depending on the circumstances, intelligent
manifestations offer the greatest guarantee against fraud, but even
these are open to being imitated, at least regarding banal and
commonplace communications. Some think that there is greater
safety concerning mechanical mediums, not only with regard to
the independence of ideas but also against deception. This is why
certain persons prefer physical intermediaries. Nevertheless, this is
a mistake, for fraud slips in everywhere. We know that with enough
dexterity even a writing basket or planchette can be directed at will,
giving it all the appearances of spontaneity. What removes all doubts
are the thoughts expressed by the medium, whether he or she is a
mechanical, intuitive, auditory, speaking, or seeing medium. There
are communications of this type that are so far beyond the ideas,
knowledge and even the intellectual reach of the medium that it would
be necessary to be oddly mistaken to attribute them to the medium.
We realize that charlatanism can be very skillful and resourceful, but
we have never known it to have the gift of transmitting knowledge to
the ignorant, or intelligence to someone who does not have it.
       To sum up, we repeat that the best guarantee is in the
recognized morality of the mediums and the absence of all causes
of material interest or vanity that could stimulate them to exercise
their mediumistic faculties because these same causes can lead
them to simulate those that they do not actually possess.

                  Meetings in General
       324. Spiritist meetings can offer big advantages because
they foster enlightenment through the exchange of ideas and
through questions and observations raised by anyone, and from
which everyone may benefit. It would be erroneous to treat such
meetings as ordinary gatherings, however, for desirable results
require special conditions, which we will now examine. Meetings
comprise true collective wholes. Therefore, the instructions given
up to this point regarding single individuals also apply to groups,
which means that groups should take the same precautions and
guard against the same problems that apply to individuals. That is
why we have left this chapter until last.
       Spiritist meetings vary widely as to their characteristics and
according to their goals; thus, their intrinsic conditions will also
vary. According to their nature, they may be frivolous, experimental
or instructive.


                                439

                            Chapter XXIX


       325. Frivolous meetings are composed of individuals who
are only interested in the entertainment aspect of manifestations.
These persons are amused by the joking remarks made by the
frivolous spirits who attend such gatherings because they can enjoy
free rein. It is during these meetings that the most banal things are
normally asked of the spirits: predictions concerning the future,
tests of their astuteness in guessing persons’ ages, objects certain
individuals have in their pockets, revelations of little secrets, and a
thousand other things of such importance.
       These meetings are of no consequence, but since frivolous
spirits are sometimes quite intelligent and are generally good-
humored and merry, interesting things sometimes occur, of which
the observer may take advantage. However, persons who attended
only these sessions and judged the spirit world according to such
samples would get an erroneous idea about it, like someone
who judged an entire population of a large city by a few of its
neighborhoods. Simple common sense tells us that highly evolved
spirits would never participate in meetings of this kind, where
the participants are not any more serious than the manifesting
entities. Those who want to concern themselves with meaningless
matters will naturally evoke frivolous spirits, just as in a social
gathering they might call in comedians for entertainment.
However, it would be sacrilege to invite venerable names, mixing
the sacred with the profane.
      326. Experimental meetings are most concerned with the
production of physical manifestations, but for many they represent
a show that is more curious than instructive. Disbelievers leave
them feeling more perplexed than convinced when they have
not seen anything else, and they devote themselves to looking
for possible artifices, because not understanding what they have
seen, they naturally suppose that trickery was involved. Exactly
the opposite happens with those who have studied the matter

                                 440

                        Meetings and Societies


beforehand, however. They understand the possibility of the
occurrences and the physical phenomena help to consolidate their
convictions. On the other hand, if trickery is involved, they will
know how to discover it.
       Despite the danger of fraud, these types of expectations have
had a usefulness that no one would deny, because they are what
led in the first place to the discovery of the laws that govern the
invisible world, and for many they are still a powerful means of
conviction. Nevertheless, we maintain that they are not sufficient
for initiating anyone into Spiritist Science any more than simply
seeing an ingenious mechanism would provide any knowledge
about mechanics for someone who is not familiar with its laws.
However, if such experiments were methodically and prudently
performed, much better results would be obtained. We shall
address this subject shortly.
       327. Instructive meetings are entirely different in character,
and since they are the only ones where we can obtain real teaching,
we shall particularly insist on the conditions under which they
should be held.
       The first condition is that seriousness must be maintained in
every meaning of the word. All present must be convinced that the
spirits whom they want to address belong to a very special order,
that the sublime cannot be mixed with the banal, nor good mixed
with evil, and that if they wish to obtain good results, they must
address good spirits. However, it is not enough to merely evoke
good spirits; a strict condition is that the participants must be
surrounded by a favorable atmosphere, so that good spirits want
to come; in other words, high order spirits do not participate in
meetings of frivolous and superficial persons – just as they would
not if they were incarnate.
       A gathering is not truly serious if it is not concerned with
worthwhile subjects to the exclusion of all others. If it is meant

                                 441

                            Chapter XXIX


for obtaining extraordinary phenomena out of curiosity or as a
pastime, the spirits who produce them may participate, but the
more highly evolved ones will stay away. In other words, the
character of the meeting will always determine the spirits who are
disposed to attend it. A serious meeting would miss its goal if it
replaced instruction with entertainment. Physical manifestations
have their usefulness, as we have stated, and those who want to
observe them should participate in experimental meetings, whereas
those who desire to gain understanding should attend instructional
meetings. Thus, both types of participants can complete their
Spiritist instruction, just as in the study of medicine some take
coursework while others do internships.
       328. Spiritist instruction does not entail only the moral
teachings given by spirits, but also the study of facts. It involves
the theory of the phenomena and research into their causes, and
as a consequence, the evidence for what is possible and impossible;
in other words, the observation of everything that may enable the
science to develop. It would be erroneous to believe that such facts
are limited to the extraordinary phenomena, or that those which
principally touch the senses are the only ones worthy of attention.
At every step of the way we encounter important facts during
intelligent communications, which persons gathered together for
study should not neglect. These facts, which would be impossible
to enumerate, arise from numerous fortuitous circumstances.
Although less prominent, they are of no less interest for observers
who find in them the confirmation of a known principle or the
revelation of a new one, which in turn leads them to penetrate
more deeply into the mysteries of the invisible world; this is also a
form of philosophy.
       329. Study meetings are furthermore quite useful for
intelligent manifestation mediums, especially for those who


                                442

                         Meetings and Societies


seriously want to perfect themselves, but to do so they must not
participate with the foolish presumption that they are infallible.
As we have already stated, one of the biggest problems of practical
mediumship is obsession and fascination. Thus, these mediums can
be deluded (in good faith) as to the merit of the communications
they obtain. We have come to understand that deceptive spirits find
an open door when they deal with individuals who are ignorant
on this subject, which is why such spirits endeavor to keep their
mediums away from all supervision, and when necessary, constrain
them to have an aversion for whomever might be able to enlighten
them. Thanks to isolation and fascination, they can easily lead
such mediums to accept everything they want them to.
       We will never tire of saying: there is not only a pitfall in this
but also a danger – yes, a true danger. The only way to escape it
is for such mediums to submit to the supervision of disinterested
and benevolent individuals, who coolly and impartially judge the
communications, and who can thus open their eyes and lead them
to see what they cannot see by themselves. All mediums who fear
this judgment already find themselves on the path of obsession.
Those who believe the light has been given only to them are
already completely subjugated. If they take the observations badly,
if they are irritated by them and reject them, there can be no doubt
as to the evil nature of the spirits who assist them.
       We have already said that mediums may lack the knowledge
needed to notice errors, and that this can allow them to be
trustingly deceived by pretty words and pretentious language, and
to be seduced by sophisms – all in good faith. This is why that
if they do not have sufficient knowledge themselves, they should
modestly resort to others who do, according to the popular quotes,
“four eyes are better than two” and “none are a good judge of
their own cause.” It is from this point of view that meetings are of
great usefulness to mediums if they are sensible enough to listen to


                                  443

                               Chapter XXIX


advice, since at such meetings they can find persons who are more
enlightened, more capable of perceiving the often very delicate
nuances by which spirits reveal how little advanced they are.
        All mediums who sincerely do not want to become
instruments of lies should take to serious meetings the
communications they have obtained in private, and should accept
and even ask for a critical examination of them. If they have been
exposed to deceptive spirits, this is the surest way of breaking
free of them and showing that they cannot be deceived by them.
Moreover, mediums who are bothered by criticism really have
no reason to be, since their personal vanity is not involved in the
matter. What they write is not a product of themselves, and they
therefore have no more responsibility for bad communications
than if they were to read the verses of a bad poet.
        We are insistent on this point because if it is a pitfall for mediums
it is also a pitfall for meetings, where one should not lightly trust
all who interpret spirits. The participation of obsessed or fascinated
mediums in meetings would be more harmful than beneficial –
they should not even be admitted. We believe that we have already
discussed the matter enough to show how participants at meetings
can avoid being deceived as to the characteristics of obsession even if
the mediums are not capable of recognizing it by themselves. One of
the most obvious is undoubtedly their pretension of being the only
ones who are right while all others are not. Obsessed mediums who
do not want to recognize their situation are like diseased persons
who delude themselves about their health, and who die because they
did not submit to the necessary treatment.
       330. One objective of a serious meeting should be to keep
it free of deceiving spirits, but it would be erroneous to consider
it free of them simply because of its purpose and the quality of
its mediums. It will only achieve this objective when the proper
conditions are created.

                                    444

                        Meetings and Societies


       In order to fully understand what the proper conditions
entail, we will refer the reader to what we stated above in no.
231 concerning the influence of the surroundings. We should
regard all individuals as being surrounded by a certain number
of invisible companions, who identify with their character,
tastes and inclinations. Thus, all who attend a meeting bring
along spirits who are sympathetic with them. According to their
number and nature, these companions can exert either a good or
a bad influence on the meeting itself and the communications.
A perfect meeting would be one in which all the members are
animated by the same love for the good and only bring good
spirits with them; however, the next best would be one in which
good spirits outnumber evil ones. This, of course, is so logical
that we do not have to insist upon it.
        331. A meeting is a collective being, whose qualities and
properties are the sum of all its members, forming a sort of cluster,
and this cluster will be stronger the more homogenous it is. If one
fully understands what was stated in no. 282, quest. 5, concerning
the manner in which spirits are informed when we call to them, it
will be easy to understand the associative power of the participants’
thoughts. If a spirit is in any way struck by thought – as we are by
a voice – then twenty individuals united with the same intent will
obviously have more power than only one. However, in order for
all thoughts to contribute toward the same goal, they must vibrate
in unison and blend themselves into a single thought, something
that cannot occur without concentration.
        Furthermore, when a spirit comes into an environment
which is completely sympathetic, it feels more at ease. When it finds
itself only among friends, it willingly attends and is more willing
to respond. Whoever has followed intelligent spirit manifestations
to some degree is certainly convinced of this truth. If thoughts are
divergent, however, they cause a collision of disagreeable ideas for

                                 445

                            Chapter XXIX


the spirit, and thus harm the manifestation. The same happens with
individuals when they have to speak in a meeting. If they feel that
everyone’s thoughts are sympathetic and favorable, that impression
acts upon their ideas and gives them greater energy. The unanimity
of this influence exerts a kind of magnetic action upon them that
doubles their effectiveness, whereas indifference or hostility upsets
and paralyzes them. That is why actors feel electrified by applause,
and since spirits are much more impressionable than humans, the
environment has much more influence upon them.
       Every Spiritist meeting should try to be as homogenous as
possible. Of course, we are referring to meetings that desire to
obtain serious and truly useful results. However, if they simply
want to obtain any communications whatsoever regardless of
quality, all these precautions are obviously unnecessary, but then
they should not decry the quality of the product.
       332. Since concentration and communion of thought are
required conditions for every serious meeting, we can understand
that a very large number of participants is one of the causes most
contrary to homogeneity. There is no set limit to this number, of
course. We know that one hundred persons, who are sufficiently
concentrated and attentive, provide better conditions than ten,
who are distracted and unruly. However, it is also obvious that
the greater the number, the less easily such conditions are met. It
is moreover a fact proven by experience that small intimate circles
are always more favorable to beautiful communications for reasons
we have already given.
       333. Another requirement that is no less necessary is that
the sessions be regular. At every meeting we can always find spirits
who we might call customary frequenters, but we do not mean
spirits who are everywhere and meddle in everything. Instead, we
are referring to protector spirits, or those who are most frequently


                                446

                       Meetings and Societies


evoked. Do not think these spirits have nothing better to do
than listen to us, however. They have their own duties and are
sometimes in no position to be evoked at the moment. When
meetings are held on set days and at fixed hours, they make
themselves available at such times and rarely fail to appear. Some
even take punctuality to an extreme. They might be offended at
only a fifteen minute delay, and if they were the ones who set
up the meeting in the first place, it will be useless to evoke them
before the appointed time. Nevertheless, we would emphasize
that although spirits prefer regularity, the truly high order ones
are not so meticulous. The demand for strict punctuality is a sign
of being lower within the hierarchy, as is anything else that is
puerile. Spirits may even appear outside set times and, in fact,
will appear willingly if the subject matter is important. Nothing
is more harmful to the reception of worthwhile communications,
however, than evoking them at random, on a simple whim or
without a serious reason. Since they are not subject to our whims,
they would not answer us, and it is especially on such occasions
that others can take their place and name.

                   Bona Fide Societies
       334. Everything we have stated about meetings in general
naturally applies to regularly constituted societies. Nevertheless,
societies must struggle against a few special problems deriving
from ties among their members. From the numerous requests we
have received for information about their composition, we will
sum up some of our explanations.
       Spiritism, which has only recently appeared on the
scene, is diversely appreciated and too little understood in its
essence by a large number of its followers in order to offer a
strong bond amongst its members that could give rise to an


                                447

                            Chapter XXIX


association. Such bond could not exist except among those
who understand its moral objective, and who completely apply
themselves to it. No serious element of connection could exist
among those who only see it through the more or less curious
phenomena. If such phenomena were placed above principles,
one simple disagreement on the right way to regard them could
cause a schism. The same would not apply to those solely
interested in its moral objective, however, because there are no
two ways of seeing it. It is also a fact that wherever one finds
such individuals, mutual trust always connects them with one
another. Reciprocal benevolence is the rule among them, and
excludes any embarrassment resulting from sensitiveness, pride
triggered by the slightest contradiction, and self-centeredness,
which demands everything for the person it indwells.
       A society in which such sentiments were shared, where the
members gathered together in order to learn from spirits – and
not only in the hope of seeing more or less interesting novelties
or making their own opinions prevail – would not only be viable
but indissoluble as well. The difficulty involved in bringing several
members together in a homogenous manner leads us to state that
in the interest of the studies and for the good of the cause itself,
Spiritist societies should aim at creating small groups instead of
large associations. These groups, corresponding with one another,
visiting one another and exchanging observations could soon
form the nucleus of a large Spiritist family that would someday
bring together all opinions, uniting men and women in the same
sentiment of fraternity, sealed by Christian charity.
       335. We have already seen the importance of uniformity of
sentiment for obtaining good results. This uniformity is naturally
more difficult to achieve when a large number of persons are
involved. In small groups, where everyone knows one another
better, there is more security when new members join. Silence and

                                448

                         Meetings and Societies


concentration become easier and everything happens as if it were
at home. Large gatherings do not allow intimacy because of the
variety of their members. They require special locales, monetary
resources and an administrative body, which small groups can
do without. The divergence of characters, ideas and opinions is
more defined, enabling troublesome spirits to sow discord more
easily. The larger the group, the harder it is to please everyone. All
want projects carried out according to their own wishes, and want
preference to be given to subjects that most interest them. Some
would even believe that the title of member gives them the right
to impose their own points of view. Then, there would be conflict,
which is the cause of ill will. This would sooner or later lead to
disunion and afterwards to dissolution, the fate of all societies
under such conditions, whatever their purpose may be. Small
groups are not subject to such problems, however. The disbanding
of a large society would look like a failure for the Spiritist cause,
and its enemies would not hesitate to exploit it. The dissolution
of a small group would pass unnoticed; if one disbands, twenty
others would take its place, and twenty groups of fifteen to twenty
persons will obtain more and do more for the spread of Spiritism
than one assembly of three hundred to four hundred.
        It may obviously be said that the members of a society,
acting as we have stated, could not be true Spiritists, since the
first duty the Doctrine imposes is charity and benevolence. This
is perfectly correct, and that is why those who behave like that are
Spiritists more in name than in fact – they do not belong to the
third category (see no. 28). But who could say that they could even
be called Spiritists at all? This is a fairly serious matter to ponder.
      336. Let us not forget that Spiritism has enemies who
are interested in preventing its development and who despise its
successes. The most dangerous are not those who attack it openly,
but those who act behind the scenes; those who caress it with one

                                  449

                              Chapter XXIX


hand while stabbing it with the other. These malfeasant beings
infiltrate everywhere they can do evil, and knowing that there is
strength in unity, they try to destroy it by sowing discord. Who
will thus say that those who cause trouble and discord in meetings
are not adversarial agents interested in disorder? They are certainly
neither true nor good Spiritists – they will never do any good but
can cause much evil. We know that it is much easier for them to
infiltrate large societies than small groups, where everybody knows
one another. Thanks to secret maneuvers that go by unnoticed,
they sow doubt, distrust and disaffection. Under the hypocritical
appearance of interest for the cause, they criticize everything
and form intimate and exclusive groups that soon break up the
harmony of the whole – that is what they want. When dealing with
such individuals it is useless to appeal to the sentiments of charity
and fraternity. It would fall on deaf ears because their objective is
precisely the destruction of such sentiments, which are the biggest
obstacle to their maneuvers. This situation, which is harmful to all
societies, is even more so to Spiritist societies, for if it does not lead
to an outright rupture, it will cause concerns that are incompatible
with the concentration and attention needed.
      337. If a meeting is going badly – they will ask – don’t
sensible and well-intentioned individuals have the right to criticize,
and if they ignore the problems without saying anything, aren’t
they approving it through their silence? Of course, they have such
a right – it is even a duty – but if their intentions are truly good,
they will issue their warning appropriately and kindly, and will do
so openly and without any subterfuge. If they are not listened to,
they will withdraw because it is inconceivable that anyone who is
not acting with ulterior motives would persist in remaining in a
society whose orientation was not appropriate for them.
      We can thus establish in principle that anyone in a Spiritist
meeting who causes disorder or disharmony either ostensibly or

                                   450

                        Meetings and Societies


secretly, through any means, is an adversarial agent, or at least
an evil spirit who must be gotten rid of as soon as possible.
Nonetheless, the very commitment which links the members of
a meeting together creates obstacles to doing so, which is why it
is proper to avoid indissoluble commitments. Moral individuals
always connect with one another in an appropriate way, whereas
bad-intentioned ones always do it to excess.
       338. Besides notoriously malevolent persons who infiltrate
meetings, there are those who, because of their very temperament,
bring trouble wherever they go. Thus, too much care cannot be
taken in admitting new members. The most harmful in this case are
not those who are ignorant about the subject or even those who are
disbelievers – conviction can only be acquired through experience,
and there are well-intentioned persons who want to learn. Rather,
those who should most particularly be cautioned against are persons
given to preconceived ideas, the theoretical disbelievers who question
everything – even the obvious – and the proud who pretend to be
privileged with the truth and always try to impose their opinions
while disdaining whoever does not think as they do. Do not be
fooled by their pretended desire to learn. You will encounter many
who would feel displeased if they were obligated to agree that they
had been wrong. Above all, guard yourselves against those insipid
talkers who always want the last word, and those who only like to
argue – they are both a waste of time and are of no use even to
themselves. Spirits do not like idle words.
       339. In light of the need to avoid every cause of trouble
and distraction, when a Spiritist society is organized, it should
place all its attention on establishing appropriate measures
to keep troublemakers from doing any harm and to facilitate
their leaving by any means possible. Smaller groups need very
simple disciplinary rules for determining the order of their


                                 451

                             Chapter XXIX


sessions. Regularly constituted societies require a more complete
organization, and the best would be the least complicated system.
Either type would be able to derive what is applicable or necessary
from the regulations of the Parisian Society for Spiritist Studies,
which we present below.
       340. Small or large societies, and all meetings, no matter
how important they are, must struggle against a further problem.
Troublemakers are not only found amongst their members but
also in the invisible world, and just as there are protector spirits for
institutions, cities and nations, malfeasant spirits also connect to
groups and individuals. First, they connect with the weakest and
most accessible, trying to transform them into their instruments
and gradually involving everybody, for their malignant joy is as
great as the number of those they have subjugated. Thus, every
time a group member has fallen into their trap, it means that there
is an enemy about, a wolf in the fold, and great caution must be
taken because it is quite probable that it will increase its attempts.
If such a member is not discouraged through strong resistance,
obsession will spread like a contagion, which will appear among
the mediums through a disturbance of their mediumship and
among the others through mutual hostility, moral perversion
and destruction of harmony. Since the most powerful antidote
against this poison is charity, it is what they try hardest to stifle.
Thus, groups must not wait until the evil becomes incurable
before applying the remedy; in fact, they must not even wait for
the first symptoms, for it is especially necessary to prevent them
from appearing in the first place. There are two effective ways to
do this if done correctly: heart-felt prayer and the attentive study
of the smallest symptoms that reveal the presence of deceptive
spirits. The former attracts good spirits, who zealously assist only
those who help them through their trust in God; the latter shows
evil spirits that they are dealing with persons who are sufficiently

                                  452

                        Meetings and Societies


enlightened and sensible enough not to allow themselves to be
deceived. If members of the group fall under the influence of
obsessions, all efforts should be geared toward opening their eyes
from the moment of the first indications, before the evil grows
worse, in order to lead them to the understanding that they have
been deceived and to instill in them the desire to help those who
are trying to free them.
       341. The influence of the surroundings derives from the nature
of the spirits and the way in which they act upon human beings.
From this influence we can deduce for ourselves the most favorable
conditions for a society that aspires to attracting the sympathy of
good spirits for obtaining worthwhile communications and avoiding
bad ones. These conditions depend entirely on the moral character of
the participants and may be summed up as follows:
       Perfect commonality of ideas and sentiments;
       Mutual benevolence among the members;
       Rejection of every sentiment contrary to true Christian
charity;
       A single desire to learn and improve through good spirits’
teachings and the taking advantage of their counsels. Whoever is
convinced that highly evolved spirits manifest for the purpose of
enabling us to progress, and not simply to please us will understand
that they must avoid those who limit themselves to admiring
their style without profiting from their words, and who are only
attracted to sessions due to the greater or lesser interest they offer
according to their individual tastes;
       Avoidance of anything in communicating with spirits that is
intended solely for satisfying one’s curiosity;
       Respectful concentration and silence during conversations
with spirits;
       Association of all participants through thought when
evoking spirits;

                                 453

                              Chapter XXIX


       Harmony amongst all mediums, rejecting any sentiment of
pride, vanity and superiority, while supporting the sole desire to
make themselves useful.
       Are these conditions so difficult to fulfill that no one will be able
to meet them? We do not think so. Instead, we hope that truly serious
groups like those that already exist in various places will multiply, and
we do not hesitate to state that Spiritism owes it broadest growth to
them. By uniting serious and conscientious men and women, they
will impose silence on our critics, and the purer their intentions, the
more they will be respected, even by their adversaries. When mockery
attacks what is truly good, it fails to elicit laughter and instead becomes
despicable. Among groups of this type, ties of true sympathy will be
formed along with mutual solidarity through the very force of the
circumstances, thereby contributing to overall progress.
       342. It would be wrong to suppose that meetings especially
dedicated to physical manifestations are exempt from this fraternal
harmony and the requirement of seriousness. Even if they do
not require such strict conditions, it does not mean they can be
frivolously held and observed with impunity. It would also be wrong
to think that the concurrence of the participants is unimportant
during such sessions. Proof to the contrary is in the fact that
frequently the manifestations of this kind, even when produced by
well-gifted mediums, cannot be obtained in certain surroundings.
Contrary influences also act upon these manifestations, and it is
certain that such influences result from differences in or hostility
of the participants’ sentiments, which neutralize the spirits’ efforts.
       Physical manifestations, as we have stated, are very useful.
They open up a vast field to observers because an entirely new order
of strange phenomena unfolds in front of them, the consequences
of which are incalculable. Therefore, meetings can have a serious
purpose in being occupied with these phenomena, but they will not
attain their objective as a means of study or proof for strengthening

                                    454

                         Meetings and Societies


convictions if such meetings are not held under favorable conditions.
The participants’ faith is not the first condition; rather, the first
condition is their desire to be enlightened, without ulterior motives
or the preconceived thought to reject everything outright, even the
evidence. The second condition is a reduced number of participants
in order to avoid heterogeneity. Even though physical manifestations
are usually produced by little-evolved spirits, it does not mean that
their purpose is any less providential. Good spirits supervise them
whenever a useful result may be realized.

                     Subjects for Study
       343. Evocations of relatives and friends or certain famous
personages in order to compare their post-death opinions with
those they held while alive frequently run into difficulties when the
conversation deteriorates into banalities and futilities. Many persons
believe that The Spirits’ Book has exhausted all moral and philosophical
questions. That is incorrect, which is why it may be useful to point
out the source that may lead to new and unlimited study themes.
       344. If evoking illustrious individuals and highly evolved
spirits is very useful because of the teachings they can provide,
ordinary spirits are no less important, even though they cannot
resolve problems of a large scope. They themselves reveal their low
position in the hierarchy, and the less the distance that separates
them from us, the more we realize that their situation is analogous
to our own, not to mention the fact that they frequently offer
us characteristic traits of great interest, as we have explained in
no. 281 in dealing with the usefulness of private evocations. It
is thus an inexhaustible source of observations even if we limit
ourselves to evoking spirits who, in their present life, offer us some
particularity involving the type of death they suffered, their age,


                                  455

                              Chapter XXIX


their good or evil qualities, their happy or disgraceful position
while on earth, their habits, mental state, etc.
       The field of study broadens with high order spirits. Besides
psychological questions, which have their limit, we can ask them
an infinite number of moral questions about all life’s situations,
the best behavior for this or that circumstance, our mutual duties,
etc. The worth of the instruction we receive concerning any moral,
historical, philosophical or scientific subject depends entirely on
the state of the spirit addressed; it is our responsibility to judge it.
       345. Besides evocations per se, spontaneous communications
offer a large number of study topics. In such cases, we only have to
wait for the spirits themselves to bring up their chosen subject. In such
circumstances, several mediums can work simultaneously. Sometimes
we can call to a particular spirit, but normally we must wait for those
who want to come, and they often do so in an unforeseen manner.
These communications can then provide a huge number of study
issues, whose themes have been prepared beforehand. They must be
cautiously discussed in order to analyze all the ideas they present to see
if they bear any stamp of truthfulness. Such a thorough examination
is the best guarantee against the interference of deceptive spirits, as
we have said. For this reason, communications received outside the
meetings should be brought to the group meetings so that everyone
may scrutinize them and benefit from them. Thus, we obviously have
an inestimable source of highly valuable and instructive elements.
       346. Activities for each mediumistic meeting may be
arranged as follows:
       1st) A reading of spirits’ communications received during the
previous mediumistic meetingafter they have been reviewed and revised.
       2nd) Various reports: correspondence, reading of communications
received outside the mediumistic meetings, report on facts of interest
to Spiritism.


                                   456

                        Meetings and Societies


       3rd) Study materials: spontaneous dictations, various issues
and moral problems proposed to spirits, evocations.
       4th) Examination: critical and analytical examination of the
various communications, discussion about various problems of the
Spiritist Science.
       347. Groups that are just starting out are often faced with
a lack of mediums. Mediums are certainly essential elements for
Spiritist meetings, but they are not indispensable, and it would be
incorrect to suppose that there is nothing that can be done without
them. Obviously, mediums are necessary for a meeting intended to
conduct experiments just as musicians are required for a concert,
but when the purpose is serious study, there are many useful and
profitable issues that group members may address by themselves.
Moreover, groups that depend on mediums can accidentally lose
them, and it would be a shame to believe there was therefore
nothing more to do except disband. Spirits themselves can for
certain periods lead groups into this situation in order to teach
them to get along without mediums. We might add that this may
even be necessary so that the group profits more from the teachings,
allowing it to dedicate a certain amount of time to meditate on
them. Scientific societies do not always have instruments required
for observation available, and yet that does not mean they have
nothing to discuss. In the absence of poets and speakers, literary
societies read and discuss the works of ancient and modern authors,
while religious societies encourage meditation upon the Scriptures.
Spiritist societies should do the same and it will be to their great
advantage to promote conferences where participants read and
discuss everything involving Spiritism – both pros and cons.
Such a discussion, in which all participants make a contribution
from their own reflections, can result in rays of light that would
otherwise go unnoticed in a private reading. Alongside special
works, newspapers also contribute facts, news, articles, and reports

                                 457

                             Chapter XXIX


on the virtues and vices that give rise to serious moral problems,
whose solution only Spiritism can provide. This is also a way to
show that it is connected to all aspects of societal life. We would
maintain that a Spiritist society that organizes its work in this sense,
arming itself with the necessary materials, will not have to wait very
long for direct spirit communications. That is why we have called
attention to truly serious groups at this point, groups that most
ardently desire to learn rather than to try and find a pastime. (See
no. 207 in the chapter The Development of Mediums).

               Rivalries among Societies
        348. Each group that deals exclusively with intelligent
communications and each group dedicated to physical manifestations
has its own mission. However, neither type would be in harmony
with the true spirit of Spiritism if they were to regard each other as
rivals. The one who “cast the first stone” would simply prove that it
was dominated by evil influences. Although approaches may differ,
all must concur in the common objective, which is research and the
spreading of the truth. Any antagonism, which is actually nothing
more than excited pride, would supply weapons to detractors and
would therefore harm the cause such groups mean to defend.
       349. These last considerations apply equally to all groups
that may differ on certain doctrinal points. As we stated in the
chapter on Contradictions, these differences are most of the time
based on side issues or even upon simple words. Hence, it would
be puerile to fragment a group to form another just because
members do not think exactly the same. It would be even worse if
different groups or societies in the same city mutually regarded one
another with jealousy. We know that jealousy between individuals
who compete with each other can cause reciprocal physical harm,


                                  458

                        Meetings and Societies


but when there is no speculation, jealousy is nothing more than
trivial rivalry provoked by self-importance. Since it is impossible
for a society to bring all adherents together in one place, those
who truly want to spread the truth, who have an exclusively moral
objective, should be very pleased at the appearance of new groups,
and if there is any competition between them, it should only be
geared toward excelling in the area of the good. Those who claim
to be in exclusive possession of the truth will have to prove it in
light of this motto: love and charity, for this is the motto of all
true Spiritists. Do they pride themselves on the superiority of the
spirits who assist them? Let them prove it by the superiority of the
teachings they receive and by practicing them. This is an infallible
criterion to distinguish those who are on the best path.
       Some spirits, who are more presumptuous than logical,
sometimes try to impose strange and impractical systems under
the prestige of the venerable names they adorn themselves with.
Common sense makes quick work of these utopias, however, but
in the meantime, they can sow doubt and uncertainty among
members. This often causes momentary disagreement. Besides the
means that we have spelled out for evaluating such systems, there is
another criterion that can provide an exact measure of their worth:
the number of followers they recruit. Reason says that the system
most accepted by the masses should be closer to the truth than the
one rejected by the majority, who see their members disappear.
Thus, we can be sure that when spirits reject the examination of
their own teachings, it is because they know how weak they are.
      350. If Spiritism is to transform humankind – as has been
averred – it can only do so by improving the masses, which will
happen only gradually, little by little, as individuals themselves
improve. What good is it to believe in the existence of spirits if
such belief does not make one better, kinder and more accepting
of one’s fellow beings, and humbler and more patient in adversity?

                                 459

                            Chapter XXIX


What good would it do to those who are greedy to be Spiritists if
they continue to be greedy; to the proud if they continue to be
full of themselves; to the envious if they remain jealous? Thus,
everyone could believe in the manifestations, yet humankind
could remain at a standstill – as we have seen. This is not how
God intends it, however. It is toward a providential purpose that
all serious Spiritist societies should tend, grouping together all
those who have the same sentiments. Then, there will be unity,
sympathy and fraternity among them, rather than any vain and
childish antagonism provoked by self-centeredness; there will be
more good deeds than mere words. Then, they will be strong and
powerful because they are supported on an unshakable foundation:
the good of all. Then, they will be respected and will silence all
mockers because they will speak in the name of the evangelical
morality respected by all.
       This is the course along which we have endeavored to take
Spiritism. The flag we have raised on high is that of Christian and
humanitarian Spiritism, around which we are happy to see so many
people gathered on all points of the earth because they understand
that the anchor of salvation, the safeguard of public order, the sign
of a new era for humankind is to be found there. We invite all
Spiritist societies to participate in this great work. From one end
of the world to the other, may they extend the hand of fraternity,
and thereby they shall snare evil in the laces of an inextricable web.

     Translator’s note: In her 1876 English version of the Mediums’ Book, Anna Blackwell did
     not include Chapter XXX. It contains the Constitution and By-laws of the Parisian Society
     for Psychological Studies, which was superseded by the Joint-Stock Company for the
     Continuation of the Works of Allan Kardec. Kardec had just finished writing the last line
     of that entity’s Constitution about an hour before his death. Ms. Blackwell replaced the
     chapter with a brief description of the Society’s meetings, which we have included here
     and have updated into modern English for historical and informative purposes.
     “The Society met every Friday evening at 8 p.m. at the residence of its President [Kardec himself],
     which during the latter part of his life was on St. Anne Street. The meetings were strictly private,
     but admission to them by letters of invitation was easily obtained. The proceedings always
     began with a short prayer, asking of the Almighty that good spirits would be sent to take
     part in them, evil ones be kept away, light be given for distinguishing truth from falsehood,
     the mediums be impressed with a sense of the sacredness of their mission, the incredulous
     and hostile be helped to a better mind, and the Spirit-President of the Society (Saint Louis)
     be enabled to watch over and assist the meeting. Then followed a reading of the minutes of
     the preceding meeting, the reports and correspondence addressed to the Parisian Society
     by similar societies in France and elsewhere, the reading and discussion of the mediumistic
     communications obtained at the preceding meeting or sent to the Society by other societies
     or by individuals, the consideration of some question of moral or scientific interest, or the
     evocation of some particular spirit as previously agreed upon. Next, all the mediums present
     seated themselves around a long table and wrote under the influence of the spirits with whom
     they were in sympathy. These communications were usually in prose, occasionally in verse
     and often very fine. They sometimes offered interesting peculiarities, such as names, dates or
     statements of facts, etc., unknown to the medium, but subsequently ascertained to have been

on April 13, 1858, according to notice from the Secretary of the
Interior and National Security.
       Although these regulations are the result of experience,
we do not provide them as a required model. Their sole purpose
here is to aid start-up societies, which may take as guidelines the
provisions they consider useful and applicable to their own set of
circumstances. Even though they are presented in simplified form,
their structure may be reduced still further with small individual
groups, which only need to establish measures for their internal
structure, precautions and regularity of their work.
       We also offer them as information to persons who want to
establish relations with the Parisian Society, either by correspondence
or as integrated members.

   Purpose and Composition of the Society
       Article 1 – The Society’s purpose is to study all the phenomena
related to spirit manifestations and their application to the moral,
physical, historical and psychological sciences. Issues involving
politics, religious controversy or social economics are forbidden.
       It shall take the name: Parisian Society for Spiritist Studies.
       Article 2 – The Society shall be composed of registered
members, free associates and correspondence members.

 correct. Additionally, sometimes a trance-medium would be controlled by a spirit, giving rise
 to episodes of vivid or even tragic interest. A communication of exceptional acumen or beauty,
 or perhaps a short but pithy comment from St. Louis was frequently received at the close of a
 discussion in reference to the point that had been under consideration. When all the mediums
 had ceased writing, each of them took turns reading aloud the communication which he or she
 had been made to write. The proceedings ended at about 10:30 with a short form of thanks
 for the presence of the spirits who had taken part in them, and of prayer for any perverse or
 unhappy spirits who might have been brought to the meeting by their spirit-guides.
  “The communications obtained on these occasions, as well as those sent to the Society
 from out-of-town, were by universal consent regarded as being the property of the
 Society, were copied into ‘Registers’ kept for that purpose, and deposited among its
 ‘Archives’. They furnished the materials from which Allan Kardec successively compiled
 The Mediums’ Book, Heaven and Hell, The Gospel according to Spiritism, and Genesis.”

in France or abroad, who by their position or work may provide
an important service to it. Honorary members are subject to
annual reelection.
       Article 3 – The Society shall only admit individuals who
sympathize with its principles and the objective of its projects,
those who have already been initiated into the fundamental
principles of Spiritist Science, or those who are seriously animated
by the desire for instruction in it. Consequently, it shall exclude
all who may bring trouble to its meetings, either through a hostile
attitude and theoretical disagreement or for any other reason that
may cause a waste of time on needless argumentation.
       All members are mutually obligated to display benevolence
and good manners, and in all circumstances must place the general
good above personal issues and self-importance.
       Article 4 – To be admitted as a free associate, the request
must be made in writing to the President, supported by the
signature of two full members, who will be responsible for the
intentions of the postulant.
       The request must state: 1) if the postulant already possesses
an understanding of Spiritism; 2) what his/her convictions are
concerning the fundamental points of Spiritist Science; 3) a
promise to fully comply with these regulations.
       The request shall be submitted to the commission, which,
depending on the case, shall propose admission, postponement or
rejection.
       Postponement is required for every candidate who does
not yet possess any understanding of Spiritist Science or does not
sympathize with the Society’s principles.
       Free associates have the right to attend all mediumistic
meetings, to participate in activities and study groups, but will
have no right to vote on administrative matters of the Society.

       Free associates shall only be such during the year of their
admission and permanent membership in the Society must be
ratified at the end of that year.
       Article 5 – To be a full member it is necessary to have been
a free associate for at least one year, to have attended more than
half the mediumistic meetings and to have given during that time
obvious proof of the applicant’s understanding of his/her convictions
concerning Spiritism, his/her adhesion to the Society’s principles
and his/her willingness to act according to the principles of charity
and Spiritist morality in all circumstances involving colleagues.
       Free associates who have regularly attended the Society’s
mediumistic meetings for six months may be admitted as full
members if they have also fulfilled the other conditions.
       Admission shall be proposed ex officio with the consent
of the associate if supported by three full members. Next, and
depending on the case, it shall be submitted to the vote of the
Society by secret ballot after a verbal report by the commission.
       Only full members have the right to vote and to enjoy the
rights granted in Article 25.
       Article 6 – If it deems it appropriate, the Society shall limit
the number of free associates and full members.
       Article 7 – Correspondence members are those who do not
reside in Paris, but who maintain relations with the Society and
furnish it with documents that may be useful for its studies. They
may be nominated through the presentation of only one full member.

                       Administration
      Article 8 – The Society shall be administered by a Director-
President, assisted by members of a board and commission.
      Article 9 – The board shall be comprised of a President, Vice-
President, General Secretary, two Assistant Secretaries and a Treasurer.

members and five other full members, chosen from amongst
those who have taken an active role in the Society’s projects,

its members designated for the purpose.
      The Commission is in charge of examining beforehand all the
administrative issues, proposals, and other matters, which must be
submitted to the Society: controlling the receipts and expenses of
the Society, and the accounts of the treasury; authorizing ordinary
expenses and all measures deemed necessary.
      It shall also examine study materials proposed by various
members, formulate them on their behalf, and set the order of the
mediumistic meetings according to the President.
      The President may always oppose the examination of certain
subjects and their placement on the agenda, except when he/she
appeals to the board, which shall decide.
      The Commission shall meet regularly before the mediumistic
meetings begin in order to examine the subjects at hand, and also
at any other time deemed appropriate.

for three consecutive months without a justifiable excuse shall be
considered to have renounced their duties and shall be replaced.

which one will be present at the opening of the mediumistic meetings.
        Article 14 – The business year shall begin April 1.
Appointments to the board and Commission shall be made at the
first May mediumistic meeting. Incumbent members shall continue
their duties until then.

paid, the Society shall determine the use of any balance left over.
       Article 16 – A membership card stating their status shall be
given to all who are admitted as free associates and full members.
This card shall remain with the Treasurer until the new member
can pick it up after having paid his/her admission fee. The new
member may not attend any mediumistic meetings before picking
up the card. Failure to do so within one month of admission shall
mean that the member is regarded as having resigned.
       Every member who has not paid the annual fee within the
first month of the beginning of the business year shall also be
regarded as having resigned if he/she has not heeded the warning
sent by the Treasurer.

strictly prohibited, as well as all those that do not have a generally
useful purpose from a study point of view.
       Equally prohibited are all discussions that are off the subject.

that require greater peacefulness and concentration, or which it
deems proper to delve into before being addressed in the presence

members passing through Paris, and mediums who lend their
help to the Society, have the right to attend closed mediumistic

meetings, except in exceptional cases and with the prior consent
of the President.

                               468

           Regulations of the Parisian Society for Spiritist Studies


       During general mediumistic meetings, the Society authorizes
admitting outside observers, who may attend them temporarily
without taking part in them. Such authorization may be suspended
when deemed appropriate.
       No one may attend mediumistic meetings as an observer
without having been introduced to the President by a Society
member, who shall be entrusted with ensuring that his/her guest
will not cause trouble or interrupt the mediumistic meeting.
       The Society only admits persons as auditors those who
want to become members or those who are interested in its
work and have already been sufficiently initiated into Spiritist
Science to understand it. Anyone who wants to attend only out
of curiosity, or whose opinions are hostile, must absolutely be
refused admission.
       An auditor is forbidden to speak except in exceptional cases
as the President sees fit. Anyone who disturbs the order in any
way or expresses ill will toward the Society’s work may be invited
to leave, and in all cases the fact shall be noted on the attendance
sheet. He/she shall be refused entry in the future.
       The number of auditors shall be limited to the available seats,
and those who can attend the mediumistic meetings shall be written
down beforehand, making mention of who recommended them and
their address. Consequently, every request for admittance to a session
must be made to the President several days beforehand. The President
is the only one authorized to grant admission cards until the list ends.
       Cards are only good for the day indicated and for the persons
so designated.
       Permission cannot be granted to the same auditor for
more than two sessions, except by the President’s authorization
and for exceptional cases. No member may introduce more than
two persons at a time. There is no set limit on the number of
admissions that may be granted by the President.

     Auditors are not to be admitted after the mediumistic
meetings has begun.

              Miscellaneous Dispositions
       Article 23 – All members of the Society owe it their cooperation.
Therefore, they have the duty to gather within their respective circle
of observation those old or recent cases that can be linked to Spiritism
and communicate them. At the same time and whenever possible,
they shall inquire about the notoriety of such cases.
       They also have the duty to list all publications that may have a
more or less direct relation with the objective of Spiritism’s projects.
       Article 24 – The Society shall critique the various works
published on Spiritism whenever it considers it appropriate. In
order to do so, it shall entrust one of its full members or free
associates with writing an opinion, which will be published in
Revue Spirite, when deemed appropriate.
       Article 25 – The Society shall build a special library
comprised of works that have been offered to it and that it acquires.
At the Society’s headquarters, full members may use this library
and the archives on days and at times set for this purpose.
       Article 26 – Considering that its responsibility may
be morally compromised by private publications made by its
members, the Society has determined that no one shall use the title
Society Member in any writing without having been authorized to
do so and without having made the text known beforehand. The
Commission shall be in charge of making a report on the matter. If
the Society regards the writing as incompatible with its principles,
the author, after having been heard out, will be invited to modify
it or renounce its publication, or not to publish it under the title
Society Member. If he/she does not wish to abide by the decision,
he/she may be expelled.


                                  470

          Regulations of the Parisian Society for Spiritist Studies


        Any writing published anonymously by a Society member
without any clues as to whom the author is belongs to the category
of ordinary publications, and the Society reserves the right to
evaluate it. However, without wanting to hinder the free expression
of personal opinion, the Society invites its members who intend to
publish in this manner to ask for its official opinion beforehand in
the interest of the Science.
        Article 27 – Since the Society desires to maintain within
itself the unity of the principles and spirit of mutual benevolence,
it may expel any member who becomes a source of trouble or
who expresses open hostility against it through writings that
compromise the Doctrine, who holds subversive opinions or
through any procedure of which the Society cannot approve.
There shall be no expulsion, however, except after an unheeded
warning, and after hearing the guilty member out, if he/she wishes
to offer an explanation. The decision shall be made in top secret by
a majority of three fourths of the members present.
        Article 28 – Every member who withdraws voluntarily
during the course of the year cannot request a proportional refund
of his/her fee. However, such refund shall be made if the member
is expelled by the Society.
        Article 29 – These regulations shall be modified as
necessary. Proposals for modification shall be made only through
the President, to whom they shall be transmitted after having been
accepted by the Commission.
        Without modifying the regulations on essential points, the
Society may adopt all supplementary measures it deems appropriate.

       In this chapter we have collected a number of spontaneous
communications, which complete and conform to the principles
set forth in this work. We could have included a larger number,
but we have limited ourselves to those that most particularly have
a bearing on the future of Spiritism, mediums and meetings.
We give them for the instruction they provide and as models of
truly serious communications. We end the chapter with a few
apocryphal communications, along with observations that will
help in recognizing them as such.

understand that he38 is preparing a new destiny for you. It is true that
you will not be able to enjoy this new life in your present existence,
but if you did not have to live again on this globe, wouldn’t you
be happy if you could contemplate from a higher place the work

     In order to maintain the personal nature of the communications in this chapter, we have
     retained the traditional pronouns with reference to God – Tr.

that you had begun and watch it develop? Be solid in your faith
and do not waver so that you may confront the obstacles that may
arise against the edifice whose groundwork you have laid. The
foundation upon which that edifice is supported is firm – Christ
himself laid its first stone. Therefore, take heart, architects of the
divine Master! Work and build – God will crown your endeavors.
But remember that Christ does not regard as disciples those who
only talk about charity. It is not enough to merely believe; rather,
you must take special care to exemplify goodness, benevolence and
disinterestedness, without which your faith will be sterile.”
                                                       St. Augustine
                                 II
       “Christ himself presides over the works of every kind that
are being carried out in order to usher in the era of renewal and
improvement, which has been foretold to you by your spirit guides.
Actually, if you would look beyond the spirit manifestations and
surmise current events, you will have no difficulty recognizing
precursory signs, which will show you beyond any doubt, that the
foretold time has come. Communications are opening up in every
nation. When the material barriers are finally overcome, political
and religious prejudices will rapidly disappear along with the moral
obstacles that hinder unity. Thereby, the reign of fraternity will be
solidly and durably established. Look how sovereigns themselves,
impelled by an invisible hand, have already initiated reforms –
something unheard of previously. Reforms that spontaneously
start from above are quicker and more lasting than those that start
from below by means of force.
       “In spite of the prejudices of my childhood and education,
and despite my memories, I already had a presentiment about the
present era. I rejoice at this and rejoice even more at being able to
come here and tell you: Brothers and sisters, take heart! Work for

yourselves and your future. Work especially for your own personal
improvement, and in your next lifetime you will enjoy a happiness
that is as difficult to imagine at present as it is for me to make you
understand it.”

                                 III
       “I think that Spiritism is an entirely philosophical study of
concealed causes and inner movements of the soul, which have
been little-defined or not defined at all until today. It explains,
more than it unveils, new horizons. Reincarnation and the trials
that you must bear before arriving at the supreme goal are not
mere revelations, but full confirmations of the truth. I am struck
by the truths that are being brought to light by means of Spiritism.
I say means intentionally because I view Spiritism as a lever that
breaks down the barriers of blindness.
       “Concern over moral issues is being awakened everywhere.
Individuals are discussing political issues, and this awakens general
interest; they discuss individual interests, and the attack on or
defense of personalities awakens passions. Theories win supporters
and detractors, but moral truths, the food of the soul – its bread
of life – remain in the dust accumulated over the centuries. To
human eyes, all forms of improvement seem useful except that
of the soul. Its education and evolution seem like chimeras that
only serve to occupy the leisure time of priests, poets, and women,
whether as simple fashion or as formal instruction.
       “If Spiritism breathes new life into spiritualism, it will
provide society with the impulse that will awaken inner dignity in
some and resignation in others, while in everyone it will awaken
the need to evolve toward the Supreme Being, forgotten by and
unknown to his ungrateful creatures.”

       “If God has sent the Spirits to instruct men and women, it
is for the purpose of clarifying their duties, for showing them the
path by which they may shorten their trials, and thereby quicken
their advancement. In the same way that fruit ripens, humans
will arrive at perfection. Nevertheless, alongside the good spirits,
who watch over your welfare, there are also imperfect spirits, who
wish you harm. While the former drive you forward, the latter
pull you back, and distinguishing between the two is where you
must direct all your attention. The way to do so is easy: simply
try to understand that everything that comes from a good spirit
cannot harm anyone, whereas everything from an evil spirit can
only work harm.
       “If you do not listen to the wise counsels of the Spirits who
wish you well, if you are offended by the truths they tell you, it is
obvious that you are under the influence of evil spirits. Only pride
can keep you from seeing what you really are, but if you cannot see
it yourself, others can see it for you, so that you are disapproved of
by those who laugh at you behind your back – and by the Spirits.”

      “Your Doctrine is beautiful and holy. Its first landmark has
been planted and planted firmly. Now, you only need to press on –
the path is open, grand and majestic. Blessed are they who reach
port. The more converts you make, the greater will be your reward.
To do so, however, you must not coolly embrace the Doctrine. You
must embrace it ardently, and this ardor will increase because God
is always with you whenever you practice what is good. All those
whom you convert will be like sheep who have returned to the
fold – poor sheep who had wandered away! Know that those who
are most skeptical, the most atheistic and the most incredulous

always have a small corner in their heart that they would like to
hide even from themselves. Well, you must seek out and find
that tiny corner, for that is the vulnerable point to attack. It is a
small crack that has been expressly left open by God as a means of
enabling creatures to return to the divine arms.”

        “Do not be alarmed by certain obstacles or controversies.
Do not torment anyone by persistently trying to convert him or
her. You will persuade disbelievers only by your disinterestedness,
tolerance and charity toward all – without exception.
        “Especially guard yourselves against violating public opinion,
whether through simple words or public demonstration. The more
modest you are, the more you will win the appreciation of others.
Let no personal motive lead you to act, and you will find within
your conscience a force of attraction that produces only goodness.
        “Under God’s orders, the Spirits are working for the progress
of all, without exception. You Spiritists must do likewise.”

                                 VII
      “What human or even divine institution has not had
obstacles to overcome and schisms against which it has had to
struggle? If it only had a sad and idle existence, no one would
bother to attack it, knowing it would succumb sooner or later.
However, since your vitality is strong and active, and since the
Spiritist tree has deep roots, adversaries realize that it could
live a long time and they try to take the hatchet to it. What
can such envious people accomplish? They might cut off a few
branches, but they will sprout again with new sap and they will
be stronger than ever.”

       “I would like to speak to you about the firmness you must
have in your Spiritist labors. Regarding the matter, I have given
you a scripture verse to study with all your heart and to apply to
yourselves, for like St. Paul you will be persecuted, not in flesh and
bone, but in spirit. The Pharisees and disbelievers of today will
revile and insult you, but have no fear. Regard it as a trial that will
strengthen you if you entrust yourselves to God, for then you will
see your efforts crowned with success later on. This will be a great
victory for you in the life to come, and in this world it will be a
consolation for all who have lost relatives and friends. Realize that
they are happy and that they are glad to be able to communicate
with you. Therefore, carry on, fulfilling the mission that God has
given you. It will be a reward for you on that day in which you
appear before the Almighty.”

       “It is I who have come – your savior and your judge. I have
come as I did long ago among the wayward children of Israel. I
have come to bring truth and to disperse the darkness. Listen to
me. As my words did long ago, Spiritism must remind materialists
that the unchangeable truth reigns over them: the good God, the
Almighty God, who causes the plants to grow and the ocean waves
to rise. I have revealed the divine Doctrine. Like a reaper, I have
gathered into bundles the good ones who were scattered among
humankind and I have said: Come to me, all you who suffer!
       “However, ungrateful humans have deserted the straight
and broad path that leads to my Father’s kingdom and they have
become lost in the rut-filled byway of impiety. My Father does
not wish for the human race to perish. He will no longer speak
through prophets or apostles; he wants you, both living and dead

(that is, dead according to the flesh, for in reality there is no death)
to mutually help one another. He wants the voice of those who no
longer exist amongst you to make itself heard as it cries out, ‘Pray
and believe’! for death is resurrection, and life is a trial that you
have chosen, during which the virtues you have cultivated must
grow and develop like a cedar tree.
       “Believe in the voices that respond to you – they are the very
souls of those whom you evoke. Rarely do I myself communicate.
My friends, who beheld my life and death, are the divine
interpreters of the designs of my Father.
       “Frail men and women, you who have believed in the
deception of your darkened minds, do not quench the flame that
the divine mercy has placed in your hands to light the path and
lead you like wayward children to the shelter of your Father.
       “Truly, I say to you, believe in the diversity and multiplicity
of the spirits who surround you. I am too full of compassion for
your sufferings and great weaknesses not to extend a protective
hand to your unfortunate wayward brothers and sisters who, while
looking to heaven, have fallen into the abyss of error. Believe, love
and comprehend the truths that are being revealed to you. Do not
mix the tares with the good wheat, or theories with truths.
       “Spiritists! Love one another – that is the first teaching;
educate yourselves – that is the second. All truths may be found
in Christianity. The errors that have taken root within it are of
human origin. And from beyond the grave – where you think
there is nothing – voices cry out: Brothers and sisters! Nothing
perishes. Jesus Christ is the victor over evil. You yourselves, be
victors over impiety.”
      This communication, obtained by one of the best mediums of the Paris
      Spiritist Society, was signed with a name that out of respect we could
      only reproduce with extreme reservation, so great would be the honor
      of its authentic signature, and because the name has already been much


                                   479

      abused in obviously apocryphal writings. It is that of Jesus of Nazareth.
      We have absolutely no doubt that he can manifest himself. However,
      if truly high order spirits only do so under exceptional circumstances,
      reason prevents us from believing that the Pure Spirit par excellence
      would respond to any appeal. It would be at the very least a great
      sacrilege to attribute an unworthy communication to him.

      These considerations have led us always to avoid publishing anything
      bearing his name. We believe we can never be too cautious when dealing
      with publications of this type, which only appeal to vanity, and whose
      least inconvenience is to furnish weapons to the adversaries of Spiritism.

      As we have stated, the more elevated the spirits in the hierarchy are,
      the more we should distrust signatures bearing their names. It would
      take a huge dose of pride for certain individuals to flatter themselves at
      having been privileged with their communications, deeming themselves
      worthy of conversing with them as if they were one of their equals. In
      the above communication, our only proof is the undeniable superiority
      of the language and thought, and we will leave to each person the care
      of appraising whether or not he who has signed it would reject it or not.

        “All men and women are mediums. All have a spirit that
guides them in moral uprightness when they listen to it. Thanks
to a special mediumship, some can communicate directly with this
spirit, while others can only hear it through the inner voice of the
heart and mind – this matters little, for it is always the same familiar
spirit who counsels you. Call it spirit, reason or intelligence; it will
always be a voice that responds to your soul, speaking valuable
words to you. You do not always understand them, however. You

do not all know how to act according to the counsels of reason, not
the kind of reason that drags itself along and crawls more than it
advances; the kind of reason that loses itself in the maze of material
and crude interests, but the kind of reason that lifts humans above
themselves; the kind that transports them to unknown regions, the
sacred flame that inspires the artist and poet, the divine idea that
uplifts the philosopher, the impulse that delights both individuals
and nations; the kind of reason that the common folk cannot
comprehend but that uplifts men and women more than it does
any other creature, and draws them close to God, the understanding
that leads them from the known to the unknown and enables them
to perform the most sublime acts. Therefore, heed that inner voice,
that good spirit who never ceases speaking to you, and you will
eventually be able to hear your guardian angel, who extends its
hand to you from on high. I repeat: the inner voice that speaks to
the heart is that of the good spirits, and it is from that point of view
that all humans are mediums.”

       “The gift of mediumship is as ancient as the world itself.
The prophets were mediums. The Eleusinian mysteries were
founded upon mediumship. The Chaldeans and Assyrians had
mediums. Socrates was guided by a spirit who inspired him with
the wonderful principles of his philosophy – he listened to its
voice. All cultures have had their mediums, and the inspirations
of Joan of Arc were nothing more than the voice of the benefactor
spirits who guided her. This gift, which today has expanded so
much, had become extremely rare in medieval times, but never
disappeared completely.

a philosophy, which, wanting to abolish the abuses of religious
intolerance, suffocated in foolishness everything that was ideal –
had to reject Spiritism, which has not ceased to spread in the north.
God allowed this struggle of positive ideas against spiritualist ideas
because fanaticism had been transformed into a weapon for the
latter. Now that the progress of industry and science has developed
this art of living well in such a way that materialistic tendencies
have become dominant, God wills that minds be led back to the
interests of the soul. He wills that the perfecting process of moral
men and women be transformed into what it should be – the
purpose and goal of life. The human spirit follows its necessary
forward march of progress similar to the gradation through which
all things in the visible and invisible universe pass. All progress
occurs at the proper time – that of moral elevation has come upon
humankind. It will not be completed during your days on earth,
but thank the Lord for your having witnessed that blessed dawn.”

      “God has charged me with a mission, which I must
accomplish together with believers blessed with the mediumistic
mission. The more grace they receive from on high, the more
dangers they will face, and these dangers are all the greater when
they spring from the very favors God grants them. The faculties
that mediums enjoy draw praise, compliments and adulations
from others – therein lies their danger. These same mediums,
who should always remember their former incapacity, nevertheless
forget it. But they do even more: they attribute to their own merit
what they owe to God alone. Then, what happens? Good spirits
abandon them and they become the sport of evil ones, with no
compass to guide them any longer. The more skillful they become,
the more they are led to attribute to themselves a merit that does

not belong to them. God finally punishes them, taking away a
faculty that could only be fatal.
      “I could never remind you too often to ask for help from your
guardian angel so that it may aid you in always remaining vigilant
against your cruelest enemy – pride. Remember this well, you who
have the fortune to be interpreters between spirits and humans:
without the support of our divine Master, you will be punished even
more severely because you have been favored more highly.
      “I hope this communication is fruitful and I desire for it to
help mediums to remain on their guard against the pitfall to which
they could succumb. As I have said, that pitfall is pride.”
                                                        Joan of Arc

       “Whenever you want to receive communications from good
spirits, prepare yourselves for such grace through concentration,
pure intentions and the desire to practice goodness for the overall
general progress. Remember that selfishness always hinders
evolution. Remember that if God allows some of you to receive
the whisper of his children, who, by their conduct have merited
the blessedness of comprehending the infinite divine goodness, it
is because God has heeded our requests and has taken your good
intentions into account, and thus wills to grant you the means of
advancing on your path. Therefore, O mediums! take advantage of
the faculty that God has granted you. Have faith in the goodwill of
our Master. Always put charity into action. Never cease practicing
either this noble virtue or tolerance. May your actions always be
in harmony with your conscience. This is a sure way of increasing
your happiness a hundredfold during this passing lifetime and of
preparing you for an existence that will be a thousand-fold sweeter.
       “May those mediums who do not feel they have the strength
to persevere in the Spiritist teaching abstain, because if they do not

       “Today, I shall speak to you about non-profitableness, which
must be one of the essential qualities of mediums, along with modesty
and devotedness. God has given them this faculty in order for them to
help spread the truth, but not for them to make it a business. I don’t
mean only those who want to exploit it as they would a common
faculty – those who set themselves up as mediums just as they would
as dancers and singers – but rather all those who would mean to
utilize mediumship for their own advantage of any kind.
       “Would it be reasonable to suppose that good spirits – even
more the high order Spirits who condemn cupidity – would consent
to participating in exhibitions and place themselves at the disposal of
a vender of spirit manifestations as though they were his accomplices?
It is no more reasonable to suppose that good spirits would favor
intentions based on pride and ambition. God allows them to
communicate with humans in order to pull them out of the earthly
mire and not to serve as instruments for mundane passions. Hence,
God could not look favorably upon those who divert their God-
given gift from its true purpose. I assure you that even in this world
they will be punished for it with the bitterest disappointments.”

       “All mediums are incontestably called to serve the cause of
Spiritism to the full measure of their faculties. However, there are
few who do not allow themselves to be led by self-importance,
which is a touchstone that is rarely without effect. Out of a
hundred mediums, it may be possible to find only one, if any,
who in the first stages of his or her mediumship – no matter

how humble his or her condition is – had not deemed him or
herself destined to obtain superior results and predestined for
grand missions. Those who succumb to such vain ambition – the
number is great – inevitably become prey to obsessing spirits, who
do not hesitate to subjugate them, arouse their pride and seize
upon their weakness. The higher they desire to raise themselves,
the more foolish-looking or even disastrous their fall will be.
        “Grand missions are entrusted to exceptional men and
women, and without their seeking it, God provides them with
the means and position in which their concourse may be the
most effective. Inexperienced mediums can never be reminded
too often to distrust what certain spirits may tell them as to any
pretentious role they are supposedly called to fulfill, for if they take
it seriously, they will only reap disappointment in this world and
harsh punishment in the other.
        “Therefore, let mediums be convinced that they can render
a grand service in the modest and obscure sphere in which they
find themselves, helping to convert disbelievers or consoling the
afflicted. If they must leave their obscurity, they will be led by an
invisible hand, which will prepare the path for them and push them
into the limelight (so to speak) in spite of themselves. Let them
remember these words: Those who would raise themselves up shall be
brought low, and those who would lower themselves shall be raised up.”

           Concerning Spiritist Meetings
      Among the following communications, some were given at
the Parisian Society for Spiritist Studies or addressed to it. Others
were transmitted through various mediums and contain general
advice concerning groups, their organization and the problems
they may encounter.

       “Why not begin your sessions with a general invocation, a
kind of prayer that can gear your minds for concentration? Without
mental reflection you will receive only frivolous communications.
Good spirits only appear where they are fervently and sincerely
called upon, but humans do not understand this fact very well.
Thus, it is up to you to set an example, and if you want to, you
may become one of the pillars of the new edifice. We have been
observing your labors with satisfaction and have been helping you
out, but on the condition that you also help us by proving that
you are up to the mission you have been called to fulfill. Be united
and you will be strong, and evil spirits will not prevail against you.
God loves the simple of spirit, which does not mean fools, but
those who renounce themselves and approach him without pride.
You can become a beacon for humankind. Learn to distinguish
between wheat and tares. Only sow wheat and avoid scattering
tares, because they will prevent the wheat from sprouting and
you will be responsible for all the resultant evil. Thus, you will
be responsible for spreading any erroneous doctrines. Remember
that someday the world may look to you, so fortify yourselves
so that nothing can dim the glow from the good deeds that will
result from your efforts. This is why we recommend that you ask
God to assist you.”
                                                       St. Augustine

      When we asked for a general invocation formula, St.
Augustine responded:
      “You know there is no set formula. God is too great to regard
words as being more important than thought. Don’t suppose that
all you have to do is say a few words to keep evil spirits away.
Guard yourselves especially against using those banal formulas
that are recited to unburden one’s conscience. Their effectiveness

only resides in sincere sentiments, and especially in unanimity
of intent, for those who do not involve their heart will receive
no benefit, nor will they be of any benefit to others. Write out a
formula and submit it to me if you wish. I will help you.”
       The following general invocation formula was drawn up
with the help of this Spirit, who completed it at various points:
       “We pray to Almighty God to send good spirits to assist us, and
to keep from us all those who may induce us to error. Give us the light
needed to distinguish truth from falsehood.
       “Also, guard us from malfeasant spirits who may spread disharmony
in our midst by arousing envy, pride and jealousy. If any attempt to appear
here, in your name, O Lord, we adjure them to withdraw.
       “Good spirits, who preside over our labors, come and instruct
us and make us amenable to your counsels. Extinguish every personal
sentiment within us and replace it with thoughts for the general good.
       “We especially ask ..., our spirit protector to send us its help
today.”

       “My friends, let me offer you some advice, because you are
covering new ground, and if you follow the path we have shown
you, you will not get lost. You were told a truth that we want you
to remember: Spiritism is a moral code and it must not go beyond
the borders of philosophy if you want to avoid falling into the
mire of simple curiosity. Set scientific questions aside. It is not the
Spirits’ mission to resolve them and in doing so save you from the
efforts of your own research. Above all, try to improve yourselves,
for that is what will truly help you evolve.”

serious communications. The tables were the vestibule of the
Spiritist Science, and those who enter it must leave behind their
old preconceptions, as they would leave behind a cloak. I can
never tire of asking you to make yours a center for serious work.
Let those who induce physical manifestations do so wherever
they will. Let them observe elsewhere; let them hear elsewhere, but
amongst yourselves, understand and love one another. What do you
suppose yourselves to look like to high order spirits when you
make a table turn or rise into the air? Simple school children.
Do scholars pass their time repeating the ABCs of their science?
However, when they see that you are interested in serious
communications, they regard you as serious individuals in search
of the truth.”

       We asked St. Louis if by this he was condemning physical
manifestations and he responded:
       “I cannot condemn such manifestations, since if they occur
it is with God’s permission and for a useful purpose. By stating
that they represented the vestibule of the Science, I assigned
them to their true place and usefulness. I only disprove of those
who produce them for amusement and out of curiosity without
drawing upon their resultant teaching. They mean to the Spiritist
Philosophy what grammar means to literature. Anyone who has
reached a certain degree in a science does not waste any more time
restudying its basics.”

       “May the spirit of charity unite you; the charity that gives,
as well as the charity that loves. Be patient with the slander of
your detractors. Be firm in what is good and, especially, be humble
before God. Only humility can raise you up, and it is the only
grandeur that God recognizes. Only if you are humble will good
spirits answer you; if not, evil ones will take control of your soul.
Bless the name of the Creator, and you will grow in favor before

invulnerable to the poisoned darts of slander and the dark
phalanx of ignorant, selfish and hypocritical spirits. In order
to do so, mutual tolerance and benevolence hold sway in your
relationships. May your defects pass unnoticed and only your
good qualities be seen; may the flame of pure friendship unite,
illumine and warm your hearts. Then, you will be able to resist
the powerful attacks of evil like the unshakable rock resists the

approve of it because the Spirits do not like to see mediums remain
isolated. God has not granted them their sublime faculty for their own
use but for the general welfare. By being involved with others they will
have a thousand opportunities to become enlightened as to the worth
of the communications they receive, whereas alone they are more
subject to being controlled by deceiving spirits, who are delighted at
seeing a medium with no safeguards in place. This is what I leave with

you, and if you are not dominated by pride, you will understand and
profit from it. And now, we shall move on to other matters.
       “Do you truly know what a Spiritist meeting should
be? No, because in your zeal you think the best thing to do is
bring together the largest number of people possible in order to
convince them. Do not be so sure. The fewer persons present, the
more you will obtain. Moral ascendancy will bring disbelievers to
your side much more effectively than physical phenomena. If you
only attract them by means of phenomena, they will come to see
them out of curiosity and you will encounter curious individuals
who will not believe, but will rather laugh at your efforts. On the
other hand, if there are only worthy persons amongst you, perhaps
disbelievers will not change their minds immediately, but they will
respect you and respect always inspires trust.
       “Be convinced that Spiritism will produce moral reform.
May your group be the first to set an example of Christian
virtues, for during this time of selfishness true charity should
find refuge in Spiritist societies. This is what a group of true
Spiritists should be like, my friends. I will provide you with
other counsels later.”

       “You have asked whether or not a large number of groups
in the same area might provoke rivalries that are harmful to the
Doctrine. I will respond that if they have been imbued with
the true principles of this Doctrine, they will see all Spiritists as
brothers and sisters – not as rivals. Those who regard other groups
with jealousy would thereby show that they had ulterior motives
of self-interest or vanity, and that they were not guided by love for
the truth. I can guarantee that if such persons were amongst you,
they would soon cause trouble and disunity.

       True Spiritism has benevolence and charity as its motto. It
condones no other rivalry except in the amount of good that can
be done. All groups that have inscribed this motto on their banner
can hold hands as good neighbors, who are no less friends just
because they do not live in the same house. Those who intend to
have the best spirits as their guides should prove it by displaying
better sentiments. Let there be a rivalry amongst them, but a rivalry
of greatness of the soul, of self-denial, of goodness and humility.
Whoever casts a stone at another would prove him or herself to
be influenced by evil spirits. The nature of the sentiments that
individuals express toward one another is the touchstone by which
we can recognize the nature of the spirits who assist them.”

       “Silence and concentration are essential conditions
for all serious communications. You will never receive such
communications when attraction to your meetings results only
from curiosity. So make sure that curiosity seekers go elsewhere for
entertainment, for their distraction would be a cause of trouble.
       “You must not tolerate any talking while the Spirits are being
questioned. Sometimes you receive communications that require
serious replies from you and responses that are no less serious
from the Spirits you evoke, but who feel displeased when certain
participants are whispering to each another. Nothing complete or
truly serious can be received while they are doing so. Also, the
mediums who are writing experience distractions that are very
harmful to their work.”

avoid all confusion and divergence of ideas. Divergence invites the
replacement of good spirits with evil ones, and when that happens
they are the ones who respond to your questions. On the other
hand, during a meeting composed of several participants who do
not know one another, how can contradictory ideas, distraction
and, worse yet, a vague and scoffing indifference be avoided? I
would like to find some efficient and secure means for this. Perhaps
it could be found in the concentration of the diffused fluids
surrounding the mediums. It is they alone – especially the ones
who are most highly regarded – who keep the good spirits at the
meeting, but their influence can hardly dissipate the disturbance
that frivolous spirits can cause. Your efforts at examining the
communications are excellent.
        You could never delve too much into studying the questions
and especially the responses. Error is easy even for spirits with the
best intentions. Slowness of writing, during which the spirit departs
from the subject that is exhausted as soon as it is conceived, the
spirit’s mobility and its indifference toward certain conventional
forms – all these reasons and many others make it your duty to
trust very slightly what you receive and always to subject it to
examination, even when dealing with authentic communications.”

at being able to attend your meetings as if they were a contest and

admirable communication? Do you think we want you to applaud
us? Do not be so sure. We do not intend to entertain you one way
or another. On your part, you are still driven by curiosity, and you
try to conceal that fact in vain. Our purpose is to make you better.
       “When we realize that our words have no effect, and that
everything on your part is reduced to sterile approval, we seek out
other souls who are more willing. We give way to spirits who only
like to talk, who are never lacking in numbers. You wonder why
we allow them to assume our names. What does that matter to
you, since there is no difference one way or the other?
       “You should know then that we would not allow this with
those in whom we are truly interested; that is, those who do
not waste our time. They are our favorites and we protect them
from lies. You have only yourselves to blame if you are frequently
fooled. For us, the serious individual is not the one who avoids
laughter, but the one whose heart is touched by our words, who
meditates on them and puts them into practice.” (See no. 268,

are animated by true charity. Therefore, be on guard and constantly
watch over the door of your heart as well as your meetings so that
this enemy may not gain entrance.

will nonetheless always depend on you yourselves not to allow

them access to your soul. If dissention stirs in your midst, it can
only have come from evil spirits, for those who have risen to the
highest degree of the sentiment of duty and comprehension of
true Spiritism know how to conduct themselves with civility,
showing themselves more patient, noble and understanding. Good
spirits may sometimes allow such struggles so that good and evil
sentiments may express themselves in order to separate the wheat
from the tares. They will always be on the side of the most humble
and truly charitable.”
                                                    Vincent de Paul
                              XXVII
        “Mercilessly repel all spirits who want to provide exclusive
advice, and who foment division and isolation. They are nearly
always vain and mediocre spirits, who try to impose themselves
on weak and credulous individuals, heaping exaggerated praise
upon them in order to bewitch them and keep them under their
control. They are usually spirits who are starved for power, who
were political or private tyrants when they were living, and who
want to continue tyrannizing other victims after death. In general,
distrust communications that display a mystical and odd character
or that prescribe bizarre ceremonies and practices. There are always
legitimate grounds for suspicion in such cases.
        “On the other hand, remember that whenever truth is to be
revealed to humankind, it is communicated almost simultaneously
to all serious groups that are attended by serious mediums, and not
to this or that medium in particular, to the exclusion of the others.
None can be perfect mediums if they are obsessed, and obsession
is obvious whenever mediums are able to receive communications
only from one particular spirit, no matter how high up the spirit
tries to place itself. Consequently, all groups (and all mediums)
that believe they are privileged with communications that only


                                494

                           Dissertations by Spirits


they themselves can receive, and which, on the other hand, adhere
to practices of a superstitious nature, unequivocally find themselves
under an obvious obsession, especially when the dominating spirit
flatters itself with a name that all Spiritists and other incarnates
should honor and respect, and would not consider profaning
under any circumstance.
       “It is uncontestable that by submitting all information
and communication from spirits to the cauldron of reason and
logic, it will be easy to expose absurdity and error. One medium
may be bewitched, and one group may be deceived, but the strict
verification of other groups, the knowledge acquired and the high
moral authority of the directors, together with the communications
that the principal mediums receive bearing the stamp of logic and
authenticity of the most highly evolved spirits, will bring quick
justice to lying and cunning dictations that come from a crowd of
lying and malevolent spirits.”
                                        Erastus (Disciple of St. Paul)

      One of the distinctive characteristics of spirits who want to impose
      themselves and make their bizarre and theoretical ideas accepted is
      pretension, as if they are the only ones who know about them to the
      exclusion of everyone else. Their tactic is to avoid discussion. When they
      see that they are being fought victoriously by the irresistible arguments
      of logic, they disdainfully refuse to respond and order their mediums to
      avoid Spiritist centers where their ideas are not accepted. This isolation
      is most fatal to mediums, because they defenselessly endure the game of
      these obsessor spirits, who frequently lead them like the blind along the
      most noxious paths.

      “False prophets do not exist only among incarnates. A very
large number of them may also be found among proud spirits

who, under false appearances of love and charity, sow disunion
and hinder the work of humankind’s emancipation by spreading
their absurd theories that they make mediums accept. In order
to better captivate those whom they want to deceive, and in
order to give more weight to their theories, they unscrupulously
adorn themselves with names that people speak with respect,
such as justly venerated saints and the names of Jesus, Mary and
even God.
       “They are the ones who sow the leaven of discord among
groups and drive them to isolate themselves from one another and
regard one another with jealousy. This is enough to unmask them
because by acting like that they provide a formal denial of who
they claim to be. People would have to be blind, therefore, to allow
themselves to be caught in such an obvious trap.
       “However, there are many other ways to recognize them.
Spirits of the order to which they say they belong must not only be
extremely good, but also eminently logical and rational. So then,
pass their theories through the strainer of reason and common
sense, and you will see what remains of them. Every time a spirit
suggests a remedy for the ills of humankind or a means of attaining
its transformation through utopian, impractical, puerile and
ridiculous measures, when it formulates theories that contradict
the most ordinary notions of science, then it cannot be any more
than an ignorant and deceiving spirit.
       “On the other hand, remember that if the truth is not
always discerned by individuals, it always is by the common sense
of the masses, which is also a criterion. If two principles contradict
each other, you have a measure for their intrinsic value by seeing
which of them will meet with the most resonance and sympathy.
Would it then be logical to accept a doctrine, whose number of
supporters is decreasing, to be truer than the other, whose number
is increasing? God wills that the truth reach everybody, and so does

not confine it within a restrictive circle. God enables it to appear at
different points so that the light may shine everywhere alongside
the darkness.
                                                               Erastus

      The best guarantee that a principle is an expression of truth is in the fact
      that it is being taught by several spirits through mediums unknown to
      one another and in several places; also, that it is confirmed by reason and
      sanctioned by the largest number of adherents. Only truth can provide
      roots for a doctrine. An erroneous theory can very well win a few
      followers, but since it lacks the primary condition of vitality, it will only
      enjoy an ephemeral existence. Thus, there is no reason for disquietude.
      It will destroy itself through its own errors and will inevitably fall before
      the powerful weapon of logic.



            Apocryphal Communications
      Sometimes there are communications that are so absurd,
although signed by highly respectable names, that the most
ordinary common sense exposes their falsity. In others, the error,
disguised by being mixed in with correct principles, can mislead
and prevent its detection at first sight. However, they do not hold
up under serious examination. Following are a few examples.
                                    XXIX
      “The perpetual and incessant creation of worlds is for God
a kind of perpetual pleasure in seeing their rays become more and
more luminous in happiness. For God, there is neither number nor
time; thus, hundreds or millions are neither more nor less to God.
God is a father, whose joy is composed of the collective joy of all his
children. At each second of creation, God sees a new joy founded
upon the universal joy. There is neither cessation nor suspension in

this perpetual movement, this great continuous joy that fertilizes
both heaven and earth. You only know a small fraction of what
there is to know about the earth, and you have brothers39 who live
on planes that humans have not yet reached. Of what significance
are the terrible heat and mortal cold that paralyze the efforts of
the most audacious? Do you believe you have reached the limits
of your world when you cannot advance any farther with your
precarious resources? Can you precisely measure your planet? Do
not believe it. There are more unknown regions than known ones
on your planet. However, since it is futile to continue propagating
your evil institutions and all your imperfect laws, actions and ways
of life, there is a limit which keeps you here or there, and which
restrains you until you can bear the good seed that your free will
shall produce. No, you do not know the world you call Earth.
In your existence, you shall see a big beginning as proof of this
communication; hence, the hour will sound in which there will be
another discovery beyond the last that was made. You will see the
circle of your known earth broaden, and when the press sings that
hosanna in every language, you, poor children, who love God and
seek the divine path, you will know about it even before those who
will give their name to the new land.”
                                                    Vincent de Paul
          From the style point of view, this communication does not hold up
          under criticism. The inaccuracies, the redundancies and the faulty
          expressions jump out at the eyes of whoever is even a little bit literate.
          Nevertheless, all that would prove nothing against the name by which
          it is signed, since such imperfections could have resulted from the
          insufficiency of the medium, as we have shown. What would pertain
          to the spirit would be the idea; thus, when it states that on our planet
          there are more unknown than known regions, that a new continent will
          be discovered, such is, for a supposedly high order spirit, proof of the

      most profound ignorance. There is no doubt that besides the frozen
      regions a few unknown corners of the earth may yet be discovered, but
      stating that these lands are peopled and that God has hidden them from
      other humans so that they will not take their evil institutions there is to
      display a great deal of confidence in the blindness of those who receive
      similar absurdities.

       My children, our material world and the spirit world, about
which you still know so very little, are like the two plates of an eternal
weighing-scale. Until now, our religions, our laws, our customs and
our passions have caused the plate of evil on the scales to drop
and the good one to rise since we have seen evil reign supreme on
earth. Down through the centuries it has always been the same
lamentation from human lips, and the fatal conclusion is that God
is unjust. There are even those who go so far as to deny that he
even exists. You see everything here and nothing there. You see the
superfluous that displaces need, the gold that shines with the clay –
the most shocking contrasts that prove your dual nature. Where
does this come from? Whose fault is it? That is what you must
calmly and impartially try to answer. Whenever a good remedy is
sincerely sought after, people find it. In spite of this domination of
evil over good through your own fault, why don’t you see everything
else steadily following the line traced out by God? Do you see the
seasons getting out of order? The heat and cold inconsiderately
clashing with each other? The light of the sun forgetting to light
the earth? The earth forgetting the seeds which sowers have planted
there? Have you seen an end to the thousand continual miracles
that occur before your eyes, from the germination of the herb to the
birth of the child, a future human being?
       “However, if everything fine is on God’s side, everything evil
is on humankind’s side. What will remedy this? It is very simple:

understand one another, and calmly follow the road whose
signposts may be perceived with the eyes of faith and conscience.”

      This communication was received in the same circle as the previous
      one – but what a difference! – not only because of the ideas but also
      because of the style. Everything in it is just, profound and sensible, and
      St. Vincent de Paul certainly would not disavow it. Thus, we may safely
      attribute it to him.

great progress all over our globe; there are an innumerable number

      During his life, Napoleon was a grave and serious man like few others.
      Everyone knew about his brief and concise style. Would he have degenerated
      after death by becoming verbose and frilly? This communication might
      have come from some soldier calling himself Napoleon.

       “No, one cannot change one’s religion when one does

instead, one falls from ineptitude and domination into wisdom
and liberty. Forward then, our little army! Forward and do not

       Who could possibly recognize St. Vincent de Paul by
this language, by these thoughts so disordered and lacking in
meaning? What do these words mean: “No, one cannot change
one’s religion; instead one falls from ineptitude and domination
into wisdom and liberty”? With its “bullets that have not yet been
molded” we highly suspect that this is the same spirit who signed
the communication above with the name Napoleon.

      Obviously, there is nothing evil in these two communications, but did
      Christ ever use such pretentious, emphatic and puffed-up language? If
      both are compared with what we inserted earlier, and which was signed
      with the same name, one will see which one bears the stamp of authenticity.

      All these apocryphal communications were received in the same circle.
      One may observe in the style an air of familiarity, turns of similar phrases,
      and the frequent repetition of the same expressions, as for example: “Go
      forward, go forward, my children”, etc., from which we may conclude that
      the same spirit dictated all of them under different names. In this circle,
      which is very conscientious but a bit too credulous, no one makes evocations
      or asks questions; they all wait for spontaneous communications. Hence,
      we can see that this method is no guarantee as to identity. With questions
      that were both demanding and logically arranged, it would have been easy
      to put this spirit in its place. However, it knew there was nothing to fear,
      since no one asked it any questions but accepted everything it said without
      scrutiny and with closed eyes. (See no. 269)

impatient vacillators, be assured that nothing happens without a
foreseen reason, and without premeditation for the benefit of all
people. O men of hypocritical fear, the reason for such delays is

the need to reduce to nothing your predictions of bad years for
your harvests.
       God inspires persons with concern about the future in order
to lead them to foresight. See how great your resources are for
resolving your purposefully aroused fears, which hide the most
avid intentions, rather than providing prudence, inspired with a
sense of human kindness in favor of the poor. See the relationships
between nations that will result; see how many transactions must
be concluded, how many resources will contribute to remedy your
fears! For, as you know, everything is linked together – great and
small will come to join in the work.
       Then, don’t you see in this movement a source of certain
well-being for the hardest working class in the states, that truly
interesting class that you, the omnipotent ones of the earth, regard
as people you can shape as you wish, and who have been created
for your own satisfaction?
       Well, what happens after all that going and coming from one
extreme to the other? It just so happens that once we have been
well provided for, the weather often changes. The sun, obeying the
designs of its Creator, ripens your harvest in only a few days. God
places abundance where your greed thinks only of scarcity, and
in spite of you, the little people will be able to live. Without your
even suspecting it, you have been unwittingly the cause of an era
of abundance.
       Nonetheless, it also just so happens – God sometimes permits
it – that evil ones succeed in their avaricious projects. However,
then it is a teaching that God wants to give everybody. It is human
foresight that he wants to stimulate. It is the infinite order that
reigns in nature, and which people must imitate in order to meet
events with courage so that they can bear them with resignation.

believe me, they shall be punished. God wants all beings to

superfluous. Just in divine benefits, great in divine clemency, too
good before our ingratitude, God’s designs are impenetrable.

      This communication assuredly contains nothing bad. It contains the
      same profound philosophical ideas and very prudent advice which, as
      to identity, could deceive persons who are not well versed in literature.
      The medium who received it submitted it to examination by the Paris
      Spiritist Society, which unanimously declared that it could not be from
      Bossuet. When asked about it, St. Louis responded:

      “This communication is good in itself, but do not believe that Bossuet
      dictated it. A spirit wrote it, perhaps somewhat under his inspiration,
      and signed the name of the great bishop so that it would be readily
      accepted; however, by its language you must recognize the substitution.
      It is from the spirit whose name is placed after that of Bossuet.”

      When asked about its motive for doing this, the spirit declared:

      “I had the desire to write something in order to be remembered by
      posterity. Seeing that I was weak, I wanted to join myself to the prestige
      of a great name.”

      “But didn’t you think that we would realize that it wasn’t from Bossuet?”

      “Who knows what could have actually happened? You could have been
      taken in. Others who were less enlightened would have accepted it.”

      Actually, the ease with which some individuals accept everything that comes
      from the invisible world under the cover of a great name is what encourages
      deceptive spirits. We must set all our attention on unmasking the ploys of such
      spirits, but we can only do so with the help of experience acquired through
      serious study. That is why we constantly repeat: Study before practicing, for
      that is the only way you will not acquire experience at your own expense.

                             Spiritist Glossary


       Spiritist – Whatever is related to Spiritism; a follower of
Spiritism; someone who believes in Spirit manifestations. A good,
a bad Spiritist; the Spiritist Doctrine.
       Spiritualism – Used in the opposite sense as materialism;
the belief in the existence of a spiritual and immaterial soul.
Spiritualism is the basis for all religions.
       Spiritualist – That which is related to spiritualism; a
follower of spiritualism. Whoever wants to believe that we do not
consist only of matter is a spiritualist, which absolutely does not
imply a belief in spirit manifestations. Every Spiritist is necessarily
a spiritualist, but one can be a spiritualist without being a Spiritist.
The materialist is neither. One may say: the spiritualist philosophy;
a work written using spiritualist ideas; Spirit manifestations are
produced by the action of spirits upon matter; Spiritist morality
derives from the teaching of the Spirits. There are spiritualists who
scoff at Spiritist beliefs. In such cases, replacing the word spiritualist
with the word Spiritist would produce obvious confusion.
       Stereotype - (from the Greek, stéréos, solid). Quality of
tangible apparitions.
       Typter - (from the Greek, tuptô, I strike). The quality
of mediums skillful at communications through typtology. A
typological medium.
       Typtology – Communication by means of raps; a mode of
spirit communication. Alphabetical typtology.
