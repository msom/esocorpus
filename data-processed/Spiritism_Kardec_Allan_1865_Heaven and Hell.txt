                               M

         The Future Life and
            Nothingness
       1. We live, we think, we act – that is certain. And we die –
that is no less certain. But where do we go when we leave this
earth behind? What will it be like for us after death? Will we be
better off or worse? Will we even exist or not? Being or non-being –
such is the alternative: forever or nevermore; all or nothing. Will
we live forever, or will everything end once and for all? Is it even
worthwhile to think about all this?
       All human beings sense the need to stay alive, to enjoy life,
to love and to be happy. If dying persons are told that they will live
a while longer, that their time has been delayed, or, especially, that
they will be happier than they have ever been, their hearts rejoice.
Of what use would such aspirations of happiness be, however, if it
only took a puff of air to dissipate them?
       Has there ever been anything more disheartening than
the thought of complete and utter annihilation? Our dearest
affections, our intelligence and progress, the knowledge we have so
laboriously acquired – everything dissolved into chaos; everything
lost! So what good would it do for us to put forth any effort to
make ourselves better individuals, to overcome our passions or to
exhaust ourselves trying to enlighten our mind, if we could derive
no benefit from any of it, or, especially, if we were to succumb to

                                 11

                           Part One - Chapter I


the thought that perhaps all of this will be of no use in the end? If
such were the case, the fate of human beings would be a hundred
times worse than that of wild animals, because animals live entirely
for the present in order to satisfy their material appetites. They
have no concern for the future. A secret intuition, however, tells us
that this cannot be the case.
       2. When humans believe in nothingness, they
overwhelmingly concentrate all their thoughts on their present life,
and there is no real reason for them to worry about a future that
they do not expect to arrive. This exclusive preoccupation with the
present leads them to think of their own selves more than anything
else. It is therefore a most-powerful stimulus for selfishness, and
disbelievers are being consistent when they reach the following
conclusion: Let us enjoy ourselves while we are here. Let us enjoy
ourselves as much as possible because we know that after death it
will all end. Let us enjoy ourselves right now, for we do not know
how much longer our lives will last. This way of thinking leads
them to another assumption that is even more consequential for
society: Let us enjoy ourselves in any way we can. “Every man for
himself,” as they say. Happiness in this world is for those who are
the cleverest.
       If human respect restrains some persons, what will restrain
those who fear nothing? They believe that human laws only
apply to those inept enough to get caught, and so they apply all
their ingenuity to the best means for evading them. If there is an
insensitive and anti-social doctrine, it is surely nihilism, for it breaks
the true bonds of solidarity and fraternity upon which all social
relationships are based.
       3. Let us imagine that for some reason an entire nation of
people are convinced that in eight days, in one month – even in one
year – they will be wiped out, that not one trace of any individual
will remain. What will they do while awaiting extermination? Will


                                   12

                             The Future Life and Nothingness


they work for their progress or education? Will they make an effort
to survive? Will they respect the rights, property and life of their
fellow citizens? Will they submit to any law or authority no matter
how legitimate it may be – that of their parents, for example? Will
they sense any kind of duty? Of course not. Well then! That which
could not possibly happen collectively is nonetheless accomplished
by nihilism each and every day on an individual basis. If the
consequences are not as disastrous as they could be, it is because
that in the first place, for the majority of disbelievers there is more
boastfulness than true disbelief, more doubt than conviction –
they are more afraid of nothingness than they let on to be; being
known as daring individuals stokes their vanity. In the second
place, it is because diehard disbelievers are by far in the minority.
In spite of themselves, they feel the weight of contrary opinion and
are restrained by social forces. Nevertheless, if absolute disbelief
were to gain the majority, society would devolve into chaos. That
is what propagating the doctrine of nihilism would lead to.1
       However, in spite of the possible consequences, once
nihilism were proven to be true, we would have to accept it, and
neither contrary theories nor the idea of the ills resulting from it
could eliminate it. And we must concede that skepticism, doubt
and indifference gain ground everyday, despite religion’s best
1
    An eighteen-year-old boy with heart disease was declared incurable. Medical science had told
    him: You could die within eight days or two years – no more than that. Knowing this, the boy
    soon gave up his studies and began indulging in excesses of every kind. When he was warned
    about the dangers of such a n irresponsible life, he responded: “What does it matter, if I have
    no more than two years to live! Why should I hold back? I want to enjoy what little time I have
    left and have fun until the end.” Such is the logical consequence of nihilism.
    However, if this boy had been a Spiritist, he would have said: “Death will destroy only my
    body, which I will leave behind as a worn out object, but my spirit will live forever. In a
    future life, I will be what I might have been in this one. I will lose nothing of what I have
    acquired in this one with respect to moral and intellectual qualities because it represents
    a gain for my evolution. Every imperfection that I will have freed myself from will be one
    more step towards happiness. My happiness or unhappiness depends on the use or
    misuse I have made of my present life. Therefore, it is in my best interest to take advantage
    of the little time I have remaining and avoid everything that could diminish my strength.
    Which of these two doctrines is preferable? – Auth.



                                                13

                           Part One - Chapter I


efforts. That is certain. If religion has shown itself to be powerless
in overcoming disbelief, it is because religion lacks something in
the struggle in such a way that if it were condemned to remaining
inactive, it would disappear at some point. What religion lacks
in this age of positivism – in which comprehension is sought
instead of belief – is undoubtedly the sanction of its doctrines by
demonstrable facts, as well as the agreement of its doctrines with
the physical data of science. If a doctrine says something is white
while the facts prove that it is black, one must choose between the
evidence and blind faith.
        4. It is under such circumstances that Spiritism has erected
a barrier to the invasion of disbelief, not only because of its
reasonableness and because of the perspective of the dangers
which disbelief poses, but because of physical incidents that have
rendered the soul and the future life both visible and tangible.
        We are all free to choose our beliefs. We can believe in
something or we can believe in nothing, but persons who seek to
make the denial of the future prevail in the minds of the masses –
especially in the minds of the youth – by supporting themselves
on the authority of their own knowledge and the loftiness of
their position, sow the seeds of trouble and dissolution in society,
thereby incurring a grave responsibility.
        5. There is another doctrine that is defended from the
accusations of materialism, because it accepts the existence of an
intelligent principle outside of matter. It is the doctrine of absorption
into the Universal Whole. According to this doctrine, upon being born
each individual assimilates a portion of the Universal Whole. This
portion comprises his or her soul and provides him or her with life,
intelligence and feeling. At death, this soul returns to the common
center and loses itself in the infinite like a drop of water in the ocean.
        This doctrine is undeniably a step above pure materialism
since it does believe in something at least, whereas the other


                                   14

                    The Future Life and Nothingness


believes in nothing at all. However, the results are exactly the
same for both. Whether souls are immersed into nothingness or
into a common reservoir, it amounts to the same thing. In the
first case, where they are annihilated, or in the second, where
they lose their individuality, it is as if they never really existed.
Relationships cannot help but be broken forever. What is essential
is the preservation of the self. Without the self, what does it matter
if the soul exists or not? People will perceive that the future is
always nil and that the present life is the only thing that interests
and concerns them. From the moral consequence standpoint,
this doctrine is as unhealthy and hopeless, and excites as much
selfishness as does materialism per se.
       6. Furthermore, one could make this objection: all the drops
of water drawn from the ocean resemble each other and possess
identical properties as parts of the same whole. But why, then, do
souls taken from the great ocean of universal intelligence resemble
each other so little? Why does genius live alongside stupidity and
the most sublime virtues alongside the most ignoble vices? Why are
goodness, kindness and forbearance found right alongside malice,
cruelty and barbarity? How can parts of the same homogenous
whole be so different from one another? Might it be said that
education leads to such differences? If that were the case, where do
innate qualities, precocious minds, good and evil instincts regardless
of education come from, and which are so often completely at odds
with the environment wherein they have developed?
       There is no doubt that education modifies the intellectual
and moral qualities of the soul, but therein lies another problem:
who provides this education that causes the soul to progress? Could
it be other souls, who, due to their common origin, could not be
any more advanced than the one being educated? Moreover, when
the soul reenters the Universal Whole from whence it came after
having progressed over the course of its life, it takes a more perfected


                                  15

                           Part One - Chapter I


member into that Whole. This would imply that the Whole should
be continually deeply modified and improved, so how can it be
explained why ignorant and perverse souls incessantly come from it?
        7. In this doctrine, the universal source of intelligence that
supplies human souls is independent of the Divinity; it is not pantheism
per se. It differs from pantheism, which considers the universal
principle of life and intelligence as comprising the Divinity itself. God
is concomitantly both spirit and matter. All beings, all the bodies of
nature make up the Divinity, of which they are the molecules and
constitutive elements. God is the composite of all intelligences taken
together, and each individual as a part of the whole is God in him
or herself. No superior or independent being rules the whole. The
universe is an immense republic without a ruler, or rather, it is a place
where each individual is a ruler with absolute power.
        8. Innumerable objections may be raised against the
pantheistic theory, but the main ones are: Since divinity cannot
be conceived of apart from infinite perfection, then, one may ask,
how can a perfect whole be formed of such imperfect parts in need
of progress? Since each part is subject to the law of progress, then
it follows that God also must progress. And if God continually
progresses, God must have been very imperfect at the beginning of
time. Additionally, how could an imperfect being, formed of such
divergent wills and ideas, conceive such harmonious laws that are
as admirable in unity, wisdom and foresight as those that govern
the universe? If all souls are portions of the Divinity, all must have
concurred in establishing the laws of nature. Then why is it that
they constantly grumble against the very laws that are their own
work? A theory cannot be accepted as truth unless it can satisfy reason
and account for all the facts that it entails. If it is belied by just one
fact, it is because it does not contain the absolute truth.
        9. From a moral point of view, the consequences of pantheism
are equally illogical. First, as far as souls are concerned it is like the


                                   16

                             The Future Life and Nothingness


preceding theory, i.e., the absorption into the whole and the loss of
individuality. If we were to believe, as some pantheists do, that souls
retain their individuality, then God would have no unified will but
would be a composite of myriads of divergent wills. Second, since
each soul is an integral part of the Divinity and thus is not subject
to a superior power, then it incurs no responsibility for its good
or evil acts. Being sovereign in its own right, it has no interest in
practicing the good2 and can practice evil with impunity.
       10. Such theories satisfy neither human reason nor
aspiration and they give rise to insuperable problems because they
are powerless to resolve all the issues that they in fact engender.
Therefore, humankind has three alternatives: nothingness, absorption
or the individuality of the soul before and after death. It is to this last
belief that logic irresistibly impels us, the belief that has formed
the basis of all religions since the world came into being.
       Now if logic leads us to the individuality of the soul, it also
points out another consequence to us: the fate of each soul must
depend on its own personal qualities because it would be irrational
to believe that the little-evolved soul of the primitive, like that of the
evil-minded individual, could be at the same level of development
as the soul of the wise and righteous person. According to the
principles of justice, souls must take responsibility for their acts,
but for there to be such responsibility, they must be free to choose
between good and evil. Without free will there is only fatalism,
and responsibility cannot coexist with fatalism.
       11. All religions accept the principle of the soul’s happiness
or unhappiness after death, or, in other words, future punishment
and reward. This principle is summed up in the doctrine of
heaven and hell found in all religions. However, where they
differ essentially is in the nature of such punishment and reward,
especially the conditions that determine one or the other. Thus,
2
    The good: “Moral righteousness; virtue” (Random House Webster’s College Dictionary, 1991) – Tr.



                                                17

                          Part One - Chapter I


contradictory points of faith have given rise to different sects along
with the specific duties imposed by each of them to worship God
and thereby reach heaven and avoid hell.
       12. At their origin, all religions had to have been related
to the degree of the moral and intellectual evolution of the
individuals comprising them. These individuals were too
materialized to comprehend the merit of purely spiritual things,
and they made most of their religious duties to consist in following
outward forms. For a long time, these forms satisfied reason; later,
however, as the light began to shine in their minds, they sensed the
emptiness of such forms. Since religion no longer satisfied them,
they abandoned it and became philosophers.
       13. If in the beginning religion had been appropriate for
humans’ limited knowledge, if it had always kept pace thereafter with
the progressive movement of the human spirit, there would be no
disbelievers, because the need to believe is in humans’ very nature and
they will readily believe if doing so gives them spiritual nourishment
that is in harmony with their intellectual needs. People want to
know where they have come from and where they are headed. If
they are told to believe in an end that does not correspond to their
aspirations or their idea of God, or to the physical data that science
gives them, and, furthermore, if believing imposes on their desired
goal conditions whose usefulness their reason contests, they will
reject everything. Materialism and pantheism seem more rational
to them, because at least they can reason and discuss them, though
erroneously. And they are right, because reasoning erroneously is
at least better than not reasoning at all.
       Nonetheless, present them with an unconditionally logical
future, completely worthy of the greatness, justice and infinite
goodness of God, and they will reject materialism and pantheism,
whose emptiness they feel in their inmost being, but which they have
accepted for lack of a better theory. Spiritism gives them something


                                  18

                    The Future Life and Nothingness


better, and that is why it is quickly embraced by all those who have
been tormented by doubt, those who have not been able to find
what they are seeking in common beliefs or philosophies. Spiritism
contains within itself the logic of rationality and the sanction of
proven facts, and that is why it is futile to fight against it.
        14. Human beings instinctively believe in the future, but
since they have not until now possessed any certain basis for
defining it, their imagination has conjured up theories that have
given rise to a diversity of beliefs. Because the Spiritist Doctrine
regarding the future is not the more or less cleverly designed work
of the imagination, but is rather the result of the observation of
material events that are occurring nowadays right before our eyes,
it will harmonize these divergent or fluctuating opinions – this is
already taking place – and gradually, through the force of things,
it will bring about a unity of beliefs concerning the future that will
not be based on simple theories but on certainty. Unity of thought
concerning the future fate of souls will be the first point of contact
among the various sects, one huge step toward religious tolerance to
start with and, later, toward complete unification.

            The Fear of Death
             Causes of the Fear of Death • The Reason
                why Spiritists Do Not Fear Death



              Causes of the Fear of Death
       1. Ever since they lived in the wild and whatever their social
position may now be, human beings have had an innate sentiment
about the future. Intuition tells them that death is not the final
phase of existence, and that those whose loss we grieve are not
irretrievably lost. Belief in the future life is intuitive and infinitely
more widespread than the belief in nothingness. Nevertheless, how
can one explain that among those who believe in the immortality
of the soul, one still finds a great attachment to earthly things and
a huge fear of death?
       2. This fear is an effect of the wisdom of Providence and a
consequence of the self-preservation instinct common to all living
beings. Such fear is necessary as long as people are not sufficiently
enlightened about the conditions of the future life. Fear acts as
a counterweight to the tendency which, without its restraining
force, would lead us to prematurely leave our life behind and to
neglect the earthly labor that must serve for our advancement.
       Thus it is that among primitive peoples the future is
a vague intuition, which later becomes a simple hope and,

                                   21

                         Part One - Chapter II


finally, a certainty, albeit still attenuated by a secret attachment
to corporeal life.
        3. To the degree that humans better comprehend the future
life, the fear of death decreases. Once their earthly mission becomes
clear, they calmly, resignedly and fearlessly await the end. Certainty
about the future life gives them another course for their thoughts,
another aim for their labors. Prior to this certainty, they only
labored with an eye on the present. With this certainty, however,
they labor with an eye on the future, although without neglecting
the present since they know that the future depends on the good
or evil direction they take in the present. The certainty of meeting
their friends again after death, of reactivating the relationships
they had on earth, of not losing one single fruit of their labor, of
unceasingly growing in intelligence and toward perfection, gives
them the patience to endure and the courage to bear the transitory
weariness of earthly life. The solidarity they find between the living
and the dead enables them to understand the solidarity they must
establish on earth, where fraternity and charity have a purpose and
a reason for being, both in the present and in the future.
        4. In order to free oneself from the fear of death, one must
regard death from the right point of view; i.e., one must have
entered the spirit world through thought, getting as precise of an
idea of it as possible. This denotes on the part of the incarnate
spirit a certain amount of development and an ability to detach
itself from matter. For those who are not sufficiently advanced,
material life prevails over the spiritual.
        While people remain attached to appearances, they cannot
discern life beyond the body, even though the real life resides
within the soul. And if the body dies, everything seems lost to
them and they fall into despair. If instead of concentrating their
thought on the outer garment, they geared it toward the source of
their life – the soul, the real being that survives everything else –


                                  22

                           The Fear of Death


they would grieve less the loss of the body – the source of misery
and pain. However, to do so the spirit needs strength that it only
acquires with maturity.
      The worry about death therefore arises from an insufficient
idea about the future life, but it also denotes the need to stay alive
and the belief that the destruction of the body is not the end of
everything. Additionally, it is triggered by the secret longing for
the survival of the soul, still veiled in uncertainty.
      Such fear decreases to the degree that certainty increases,
and disappears when certainty is complete.
      That is the providential side of the issue. For people who are
not sufficiently enlightened, whose reason can hardly support the
highly positive and alluring perspective of a better future, it would
be prudent not to dazzle them with such an idea since it could lead
them to neglect the present. The present, however, is necessary for
their material and intellectual evolution.
      5. This state of things is postponed and prolonged by purely
human causes that will disappear with progress. The first cause is the
aspect from which the future life has been presented, an aspect that
might satisfy little-developed minds, but which cannot satisfy the
enlightened reason of reflective individuals. Thus, they say: “Since
they present us with principles contested by logic and the positive
data of science and claim such principles to be absolute truths, it is
because they are not actually true”; hence the disbelief of some and
the dubious belief of a great many. The future life is a vague idea to
them, more a probability than an absolute certainty. They would
believe and they would desire it to be so, but they exclaim: “But
what if it really isn’t true! The present is here and now; let’s concern
ourselves with it first. The future will take care of itself.”
      Then they add, “What is the soul, really? A point, an atom,
a spark or a flame of some kind? How does it feel, see or perceive?”
The soul does not seem like an actual reality to them, but rather


                                  23

                           Part One - Chapter II


an abstraction. Those who are dear to them, reduced to atoms – in
their way of thinking – are lost to them and no longer appear with
the qualities for which they loved them. They cannot comprehend
the love of a spark or the love one may have for it, and they are
hardly satisfied with the perspective of being transformed into
monads. Thus, they feel justified in preferring the physicality of
earthly life, which has something more substantial about it. The
number dominated by this type of thought is considerable.
        6. Another cause for remaining attached to earthly things,
even among those who most firmly believe in the future life, is the
impression they retain of the childhood teachings related to it.
        We must confess that the picture that religion has sketched out
concerning the subject is nothing seductive and even less consoling.
On one hand, there are the contortions of the damned in eternal
torture and flame, paying for the errors of their momentary lives.
Centuries follow centuries without any pity or hope for a commuting
of their sentence, and what is more pitiless is that repentance would
be futile. On the other hand are the souls languishing and suffering
in purgatory as they await their deliverance at the goodwill of the
living, who will pray for them or who will beseech others to pray
for them, without being able to put forth any effort of their own
to get out. These two categories comprise the great majority of the
population beyond the grave. Above them soars the very limited
class of the elect, enjoying contemplative beatitude for all eternity.
This eternal uselessness, even though preferable to nothingness,
of course, is nothing but a fastidious monotony. This is why in
paintings depicting the blessed we see angelic figures that seem to
express more boredom than true blissfulness.
        This picture neither satisfies aspirations nor the instinctive idea
of progress, which is the only one compatible with absolute bliss. It
is difficult to imagine that, upon being baptized, the primitive, who
only possesses an obtuse morality, is suddenly on the same level as


                                    24

                           The Fear of Death


someone who after long years of labor has reached the highest degree
of knowledge and morals. It is even less conceivable that a child who
has died at a very early age, before being aware of its own acts, will
enjoy the same privileges solely because of a ceremony in which its
own will played no part. Such ideas should not hesitate to concern
the most fervent believers no matter how little they think about them.
       7. If future happiness does not depend on working to
progress while on earth, then the ease with which this happiness
is believed to be acquired by means of a few outward practices –
and even by the possibility of being purchased with money –
without serious inner reform of character and habits, places more
worth on the pleasures of the world. Many deeply believe that
because their future is assured by fulfilling certain formulas or by
posthumous gifts that cost them nothing, then it is superfluous to
make sacrifices or suffer anything for the benefit of others, since
salvation may be had by each working for himself or herself.
       Of course, not everybody thinks this way, for there are many
noteworthy exceptions; however, one could not deny that most
actually do think this way, especially the little-enlightened masses,
and that the idea commonly held regarding the conditions for
happiness in the other world tends to prolong attachment to the
things of this one, and therefore encourages selfishness.
       8. We would add that everything – all our customs –
contributes toward causing us to mourn the loss of earthly life and
to dread the passage from earth to heaven. Death is surrounded
with morbid ceremonies that serve more to terrorize than to awaken
hope. If one depicts death, it is always done so in its revolting aspect
and never as the sleep of transition. All of death’s symbols remind
us of the destruction of the body, portraying it as dreadful and
de-fleshed. The soul is never presented radiantly detaching itself
from its earthly fetters. The departure to that happier world is only
accompanied by the mourning of the survivors, as if a big disgrace


                                  25

                          Part One - Chapter II


had befallen the deceased. They say eternal goodbyes as if they will
never see them again. What they regret is that the deceased have
lost the pleasures of this world as though they have not discovered
greater pleasures beyond the grave. Such a misfortune – they say –
to have died so young, rich and happy, with the perspective of such
a shining future! The idea of an even better future barely passes
through their mind, because it has not set down deep roots. Thus,
everything works together to inspire the terror of death instead of
the awakening to hope. There is no doubt that humankind will take
a long time to undo such preconceptions, but such will happen to
the degree that their faith is firmly established and to the point that
they conceive of a more wholesome idea of the spirit life.
       9. What is more, the usual belief places souls in regions that
are only accessible to thought, and where they become somehow
unknown to the living. The church itself sets up an impassable
barrier between the living and the dead, and declares that the
relationship is broken and that any kind of communication between
them is impossible. If souls are in hell, all hope is lost of ever seeing
them again, unless we ourselves also end up there. If they find
themselves among the elect, however, they are completely absorbed
in contemplative beatitude. All this interposes between the dead
and the living a distance that leads us to regard the separation as
eternal, which is why we prefer to have beings whom we love right
here with us, suffering on earth instead of seeing them leave, even
if they are going to heaven. Finally, will the soul who is in heaven
really be happy knowing that its child, father, mother or friends are
burning in hell forever?

        Why Spiritists Do Not Fear Death
      10. The Spiritist Doctrine completely transforms the way
one envisages the future. The future life ceases to be a hypothesis

                                   26

                          The Fear of Death


and becomes a reality. The state of souls after death is no longer
a theory but the result of observation. The veil has been lifted
and the spirit world has appeared to us in the fullness of its
practical reality. Human minds did not discover it through some
ingenious conception; instead, the very inhabitants of that world
have come to us describing their situation. We have seen them
on every degree of the spirit scale, in every phase of happiness
and unhappiness, and, finally, in all the situations of life beyond
the grave. That is why Spiritists view death so calmly and why
they are so serene during their last moments on earth. What
sustains them is not only hope but certainty. They know that
the future life is but a continuation of earthly life, only under
better conditions, and they await it with the same confidence
with which they have awaited the rising of the sun after a stormy
night. The reasons for such confidence arise from the phenomena
they have witnessed and the harmony of such phenomena both
with the logic, justice and goodness of God and the innermost
aspirations of humankind.
       For Spiritists, the soul is not an abstraction. It has an
ethereal body, which makes it a defined being. It can be grasped
and perceived through thought, which is sufficient for it to clarify
for us its individuality, aptitudes and perceptions. The memory
of those who are dear to us rests upon something real. They are
no longer portrayed as fleeting flames that speak nothing to our
thoughts, but as concrete forms that more than anything show
themselves to be living beings. Furthermore, instead of being
lost in the depths of space, they are all around us. The corporeal
world and the spirit world are in constant relationship and they
provide mutual assistance to each other. Since doubt about the
future is no longer feasible, the fear of death disappears. We calmly
see its approach as deliverance through the door of life instead of
annihilation through the door of nothingness.

                                    Heaven
      1. The [French] word ciel3 usually designates the undefined
space that surrounds the earth; more particularly, the part that
is above our horizon. It comes from the Latin coelum, formed
from the Greek koilos, concave, because the sky used to seem to be
an immense concavity. The ancients believed in the existence of
many superimposed skies, composed of both solid and transparent
matter, forming concentric spheres. Earth was in the center. As
they spun around the earth, these spheres swept along the heavenly
bodies contained in their orbits.
      This idea came from limited astronomical knowledge
and was employed by all the theogonies, which devised the
gradations of heaven and the different degrees of blessedness,
the furthermost being the abode of supreme bliss. According to
the most common opinion, there were seven heavens; hence the
expression to be in seventh heaven to express perfect bliss. Muslims
believe in the existence of nine heavens, and with each one the
happiness of believers becomes greater. The astronomer Ptolemy4
counted eleven and called the last one Empyrean5, because of the

    The French word ciel can be translated into English either as heaven or sky. This paragraph
    deals with the entomological discussion of the French word, although the chapter in general
    deals with the concept of heaven. In this particular paragraph, the English translation sky is
    more applicable, although the more poetic term the heavens would also be appropriate. – Tr.

brilliant light that reigned therein. To date, this continues to be
the name poetry gives to the region of eternal glory. Christian
theology recognizes three heavens: the first is the region of the air
and clouds; the second is the space in which the heavenly bodies
orbit; the third is located beyond the second, and is the dwelling
place of the Most High, the habitation of the elect, i.e., those who
contemplate God face to face. According to this belief, it is said
that St. Paul was taken up into the third heaven.
       2. The various doctrines related to the dwelling of the
blessed all rest upon the double error of regarding the earth as the
center of the universe and of limiting the region of the heavenly
bodies. It is beyond this imaginary limit that all doctrines have
located the blessed region and the dwelling place of the Almighty.
It is a strange anomaly that locates the Author of all things, the
One who governs all things, at the extremities of creation instead
of at the center, where the radiating thought of the Divine could
embrace everything!
       3. With its inexorable logic employing observation and
facts, science has taken its searchlight into the depths of space and
has shown how implausible all those theories are. The earth is no
longer the hub of the universe, but one of the smallest heavenly
bodies traveling through the immensity of space. The sun itself is
no more than the center of one planetary vortex, while the stars
are other innumerable suns, around which an infinite number of
worlds spin. These suns are separated by distances that are only
accessible through thought, even though they look like they could
touch each other. In this assembly, ruled by eternal laws, and where
the wisdom and omnipotence of the Creator are revealed, the
earth is no more than an imperceptible spot and one of the least
favored planets as to habitability. In light of such considerations,
it is reasonable to ask why God would make the earth the only
seat of life, and relegate his most favored creatures to it. On the


                                 30

                              Heaven


contrary, everything proclaims that life exists everywhere and
that humankind is as infinite as the universe itself. Since science
has revealed to us worlds that are similar to our own, God could
not have created them without some purpose – God must have
peopled them with beings capable of governing them.
       4. The ideas held by human beings are always the result of
what they know about, and like all important discoveries, that of
the constitution of worlds has had to set such ideas on a different
course. Under the influence of this new knowledge, beliefs have
been modified: heaven has been displaced and the unlimited stellar
region can no longer serve it. Where is it then? When faced with
this question, all religions remain mute.
       Spiritism has come to answer this question by demonstrating
the true destiny of humankind. Taking the nature of this destiny
and the divine attributes as a departure point, one comes to
a conclusion; i.e., starting from the known, one reaches the
unknown through a logical deduction – not to mention the direct
observations that Spiritism offers.
       5. Human beings are composed of body and spirit. The spirit
is the principal, reasoning and intelligent being, whereas the body
is the material envelope that temporarily clothes the spirit so that
it can fulfill its mission on earth and carry out the work needed
for its evolution. After it has been used, the body is destroyed but
the spirit survives. Deprived of the spirit, the body is only inert
matter – like an instrument deprived of the part that makes it
function. Without the body, the spirit retains everything: life and
intelligence. Upon leaving the body behind, it returns to the spirit
world, from where it came in order to incarnate.
       Hence, there are two worlds: the corporeal world, composed
of incarnate spirits, and the spirit world, composed of discarnate
spirits. Due to the materiality of their envelope, the beings of the
corporeal world are connected to the earth or some other globe.


                                31

                         Part One - Chapter III


The spirit world extends everywhere, however; it surrounds us
and fills space without any designated limit. Due to the fluidic
nature of their envelope, the beings that comprise it can cross great
distances at the speed of thought instead of moving heavily upon
the ground. The death of the body is no more than the breaking
of the ties that had held them captive.
       6. Spirits are created simple and ignorant, but endowed
with aptitudes so that they may eventually know everything and
evolve as a result of their free will. By evolving, they acquire new
knowledge, new faculties, new perceptions and, consequently,
new pleasures unknown to less evolved spirits. They see, hear, feel
and comprehend what less evolved spirits cannot see, hear, feel
and comprehend. Happiness is the direct result of the progress that
has been made; thus, of two spirits, one may not be as happy as the
other solely because it is not of the same degree of intellectual and
moral advancement; however, it is not necessary for each one to be in a
separate place. Although they may exist side by side, one may be in
darkness, while everything seems resplendent to the other – like a
blind and a sighted individual who have joined hands; one perceives
the light while the other does not receive the least impression of it.
Since spirits’ happiness is inherent to their own individual qualities,
they can enjoy it anywhere they may find themselves, whether on the
earth in the midst of incarnates, or in space.
       A crude comparison will enable us to understand this
situation better. If two individuals are at a concert and one is a
good musician with a trained ear, while the other is unfamiliar
with music and has a “tin ear”, the first will experience a sensation
of happiness, whereas the second will remain unmoved, for one
comprehends and perceives what produces absolutely no impression
on the other. The same applies to all the sensations experienced
by spirits, and which are the direct result of their ability to sense
them. The spirit world displays splendors everywhere; harmonies and


                                  32

                                   Heaven


sensations that less evolved spirits under the influence of matter cannot
even perceive because they are only accessible to purified spirits.
        7. Spirits’ progress consists in the fruit of their own labor, but
since they are free, they labor for their advancement with greater
or lesser activity or negligence according to their will, accelerating
or retarding their progress and, consequently, their own happiness.
While some advance rapidly, others remain at a standstill in the
lower regions for centuries. Spirits are therefore the authors of
their own fortunate or unfortunate situation, according to the
words of Christ, “To each according to his deeds.” Every spirit
who lags behind cannot blame anyone but itself, just as the one
who evolves quickly has the exclusive merit of its own efforts; thus,
it gives greater value to the happiness it has won for itself.
        Supreme bliss is only shared in by perfect spirits, or rather, by pure
spirits, who have only attained it after having evolved in intelligence
and morality. Intellectual progress and moral progress rarely march
hand in hand, but whatever a spirit does not succeed at during a given
time, it does during another, so that the two areas of progress end
up reaching the same level. That is why we often see intelligent and
educated individuals who are little-advanced morally, and vice-versa.
        8. Incarnation is necessary for the dual moral and intellectual
progress of the spirit: intellectual progress through the obligatory
activity of labor; moral progress through the mutual need that
men and women have of one another. Societal life is the touchstone
of good and bad qualities. Goodness, malice, sweetness, violence,
benevolence, charity, selfishness, greed, pride, humility, sincerity,
honesty, loyalty, insincerity, and hypocrisy – in other words,
everything that comprises the moral or perverse individual – has its
motive, purpose and stimulus in men and women’s relationships
with one another. Persons who live in isolation possess neither vices
nor virtues. Through their isolation they keep themselves from evil, but
at the same time they nullify the good they possess within themselves.


                                     33

                                    Part One - Chapter III


       9. One single corporeal existence is manifestly insufficient
for the spirit to acquire all the good it lacks and to eliminate all its
evil. How could primitives, for example, bring themselves up to
the moral and intellectual level of the most advanced Europeans in
only one incarnation? It would be materially impossible. Must they
therefore remain eternally in ignorance and barbarity, deprived of
the sensations that only the development of the faculties could
provide them? Simple commonsense rejects such a notion, which
would be not only the negation of divine justice and goodness, but
also of the very evolutionary and progressive laws of nature. Thus,
God, who is supremely just and good, grants to the spirit as many
incarnations as are necessary for it to reach its objective: perfection.
       With each new existence, the spirit brings what it had
acquired in the previous ones in terms of aptitudes, intuitive
knowledge, intelligence and morality. Each existence is thus a
forward step on the path of progress.6
       Incarnation is inherent to the status of less evolved spirits
only, finally becoming unnecessary to those who have transcended
such a status, and who have progressed either in the spirit state in
the spirit world, or in corporeal existences on higher worlds that
have none of earth’s materiality. To such spirits, incarnation then
becomes voluntary for the purpose of exerting a more direct action
upon other incarnates for the fulfillment of a mission with which
they have been charged. In doing so, they accept through self-
denial the vicissitudes and sufferings of incarnation.
       10. In the interval between corporeal lives, the spirit reenters
the spirit world for a period of time which could be long or short,
where it is either happy or unhappy according to the good or evil it
has done. Since the spirit state is the spirit’s normal, definitive state
and since the spirit body does not die, then the corporeal state must
be transitory and fleeting. It is while in the spirit state especially
6
    See footnote 1, chap. I no. 3. – Auth.



                                             34

                                 Heaven


that the spirit reaps the fruits of the progress it accomplished
through the labor of incarnation. The spirit state is also where it
prepares itself for new struggles and makes resolutions that it will
endeavor to put into practice when it returns to humanity.
       The spirit also progresses while in the spirit state; there, it
acquires special knowledge that it would not be able to obtain on
earth and it modifies its ideas. The corporeal state and the spirit
state comprise the source of two kinds of progress in solidarity
with each other, and that is the reason why a spirit must alternately
pass through these two modes of existence.
       11. Reincarnation can occur on earth or on other worlds.
Amongst all the worlds, there are some that are more highly evolved,
where existence involves conditions that are less physically and
morally difficult than on earth, but to which only spirits who have
reached a degree of purity in keeping with such worlds are admitted.
       Life on these higher worlds is a reward in itself, since
on them we are free from all the earthly ills and vicissitudes to
which we are exposed here on earth. The less material – almost
fluidic – bodies are not subject to the illnesses and weaknesses,
nor to the same needs as on earth. Evil spirits are excluded and the
inhabitants enjoy full peace with no other concerns than evolving
through intellectual endeavor. There, true fraternity reigns because
there is no selfishness; true equality because there is no pride; true
liberty because there are no disorderly acts to restrain, nor are there
any ambitious individuals who try to oppress the weak. Compared
to earth, these worlds are true heavens and represent the various
stages along the path of progress leading to the final state. Earth
is a little-evolved world meant for the purification of imperfect
spirits, and that is why evil will predominate until God transforms
it into a dwelling place for more- advanced spirits.
       Thus it is that the spirit progresses gradually to the degree that
it develops itself and reaches the apogee of bliss. However, before


                                   35

                        Part One - Chapter III


having reached the culmination of perfection, it enjoys happiness
relative to its progress. A child enjoys the pleasures of childhood,
later those of youth, and finally the solid ones of maturity.
        12. The bliss of the blessed spirits does not consist in
contemplative idleness, which, as we have stated many times, would
be an eternal and fastidious uselessness. On the contrary, spirit life
at all degrees involves constant activity, but an activity without
weariness. Supreme bliss consists in enjoying all the splendors of
creation, which no human language has ever been able to describe,
and of which the most fertile imagination cannot conceive.
Moreover, it consists in the knowledge and comprehension of all
things, the absence of any physical and mental suffering, inner
satisfaction, imperturbable serenity of spirit, pure love that unites
all beings due to the absence of friction from contact with evil
individuals, and above all, the contemplation of God and the
comprehension of the divine mysteries that are revealed to the most
worthy. Bliss may also be found in tasks for which one is happy to
be made responsible. Pure spirits are the messiahs or messengers of
God for the transmission and execution of the divine will. They
fulfill great missions and preside over the formation of worlds and
the general harmony of the universe, a glorious task entrusted only
to those who have reached perfection. Those of the highest order
are the only ones who know the secrets of God, deriving inspiration
from the divine thought of which they are the direct representatives.
        13. Spirits’ attributes are proportional to their progress,
their degree of enlightenment, their capabilities, their experience,
and the degree of trust they deserve from the Supreme Lord.
There are no privileges or favors that do not derive from their
own merit; everything is measured and weighed on the scales of
strict justice. The most important missions are only entrusted to
those whom God deems capable of fulfilling them and incapable
of failure or compromise. While the most worthy spirits comprise


                                 36

                                Heaven


the supreme council under God’s supervision, the guidance of
planetary systems is committed to the high order ones, and the
guidance of special worlds is entrusted to others. Next, following
in the order of hierarchical advancement and subordination
are those in charge of more limited responsibilities such as the
progress of nations, the protection of families and individuals, the
drive behind each branch of progress, and the diverse operations
of nature down to the most intimate details of creation. In this
vast and harmonious whole, there are occupations for all abilities,
aptitudes and strengths; for spirits who aspire to progress,
occupations are joyfully accepted and feverously requested
because they are a means of advancement.
       14. Alongside the great missions entrusted to high order
spirits, there are others of all levels of importance. These missions
are granted to spirits of all categories, and we may affirm that each
incarnate spirit has its duties to fulfill to the benefit of its fellow
beings: from being the head of the family who is charged with
the progress of his or her children, to the individual of genius
who sows new seeds of progress within society. These secondary
missions are where the failures, falsehoods and errors occur, but
which only harm the individual without affecting the whole.
       15. All minds therefore cooperate in the overall work,
whatever may be their degree of development, and each one to
the measure of its abilities: some in the incarnate state; others in
the spirit state. We see activity everywhere, from the bottom to the
apex of the scale, all learning and helping in mutual support, and
lending helping hands in order to reach the summit.
       Thus, solidarity is established between the spirit and
corporeal worlds; in other words, between humans and spirits:
between captive and free spirits. Hence, true sympathies and
noble affections continue and consolidate through purification
and continued relationships.

                         Part One - Chapter III


       Life, then, is in motion everywhere. Not one corner of
the infinite is unpopulated, nor is there one region that is not
incessantly traveled by innumerable legions of radiant spirits who
are invisible to the crude senses of incarnates but whose sight stuns
with joy and awe souls freed from matter. Everywhere, finally,
there is happiness relative to all levels of progress, to all fulfilled
duties, with each spirit bringing the elements of its own happiness
according to the category into which its evolution has placed it.
       Happiness depends on the qualities of individuals and not
on the physical condition of their environment; thus, happiness is
anywhere where there are spirits capable of being happy. Happiness
has no circumscribed or appointed place in the universe. Wherever
they may be, pure spirits can contemplate the divine majesty, for
God is everywhere.
       16. Nevertheless, happiness is not just personal. If we were to
possess it only within ourselves without being able to share it with
others, it would be sad and selfish. We may also find happiness in
the communion of ideas that unites sympathetic beings. Happy
spirits attract one another through similarity of ideas, tastes, and
sentiments, thus forming vast groups of homogenous families, in
the midst of which each individual radiates its own qualities and
is saturated by the serene and beneficent emanations of the whole.
Even though some of its members may be away on a mission, at
times they meet at a given point in space to give account of their
work, and at other times they congregate around a more highly
evolved spirit in order to receive instruction and counsel.
       17. Although spirits are everywhere, worlds are their
preferred meeting centers because of the similarity between them
and the worlds they inhabit. High order spirits abound around
advanced worlds just as low order spirits swarm around little-
evolved ones. Earth is one of the latter. Each globe therefore has
its own population of incarnate and discarnate spirits, which is


                                  38

                                 Heaven


mostly sustained by the incarnation and discarnation of these
same spirits. This population is more solid on less evolved worlds
because of the spirits’ attachment to matter, but it is more fluid
on higher worlds. From these higher worlds, however, which are
true centers of light and happiness, spirits depart to lower worlds
in order to sow the seeds of progress, to bring them consolation
and hope, and to raise their inhabitants’ courage, which has been
beaten down by the troubles of life. They sometimes incarnate on
them in order to fulfill their mission more effectively.
       18. So, in this unlimited immensity, where is heaven?
Everywhere. No borders enclose it. Advanced worlds are the last
stations leading to it; virtues facilitate the journey to it, while vices
hinder access.
       Before this majestic picture that peoples all the corners of
the universe, giving everything in creation a purpose and a reason
for being, how small and trivial is the doctrine that circumscribes
humanity within an imperceptible point in space, and which
shows it as having begun at a determined instant simply to end
with the world that has contained it – all this not having embraced
more than one minute in all eternity! How sad, cold and frigid is
that doctrine, wherein the entire universe is shown to us before,
during and after earthly humankind, to be without life, without
movement, like a huge desert immersed in profound silence! How
disheartening is the description it gives of the few elect involved in
perpetual contemplation, while the vast majority of other souls are
condemned to unending suffering! How pungent to loving hearts
is the barrier that has been set up between the living and the dead!
Happy souls – they say – only think about their own happiness;
the lost ones only think about their own misery. Is it any wonder
that selfishness reigns on earth when it shows up in heaven itself?
So, how narrow is such an idea of the grandeur, the power and the
goodness of God!


                                   39

                        Part One - Chapter III


        In contrast, how sublime is Spiritism’s idea of God! How
its Doctrine enhances ideas and broadens thought! But who says
it is true? Reason first, revelation next, and finally, its harmony
with the progress of science. Between two doctrines, one which
trivializes and the other exalts the attributes of God, one which
is in disharmony and the other in harmony with progress, one
which remains lagging behind while the other moves ahead,
commonsense says which side truth is on. When faced with both,
let each consult his or her conscience and an inner voice will
speak through it. Such inner aspirations are the voice of God, who
cannot deceive humankind.
        19. But perhaps one will ask: Why didn’t God just reveal the
whole truth from the start? For the same reason that one does not
teach children what must only be taught adults. Limited revelation
was adequate for a certain period of humankind’s development,
and God provided it according to the moral strength of their
spirit. Those who today have received a more complete revelation
are the same spirits who received only a portion of it in other times,
but who since then have grown in intelligence.
        Before science revealed the living forces of nature, the
composition of heavenly bodies, the true role of earth and its
formation, could human beings have comprehended the immensity
of outer space and the plurality of worlds? Before geology
demonstrated the formation of the earth, could they have removed
hell from its interior and understood the allegorical meaning of
the six days of creation? Before astronomy discovered the laws that
govern the universe, could they have understood that there is no
up or down in space, that the heavens are not above the clouds or
limited by the stars? Could they have identified themselves with
the spirit life before the progress of psychology? Could they have
conceived of a fortunate or unfortunate life after death that was
not a circumscribed place or under a material form? No. Since


                                 40

                               Heaven


they understood more through the senses than through thought,
the universe was too vast for their comprehension. It was necessary
to restrain it to smaller proportions and broaden it later on. A
partial revelation had its usefulness; it was satisfactory back then,
but it no longer is today. The error lies with those who, without
taking into account the progress of ideas, think they can govern
mature people with the precepts given to them during childhood.

          as an Imitation of Pagan Hell • Limbo • A Portrayal
              of Pagan Hell • An Outline of Christian Hell



          The Intuition of Future Punishment
       1. Down through history, people have believed through
intuition that life after death must be happy or unhappy according
to the good or evil they practiced during their life on earth. However,
their idea about that future life is related to the development of their
moral sense and their correct or incorrect notions about good and
evil. Their ideas concerning punishment and reward are reflections
of their predominant instincts; thus, warlike peoples have always
regarded supreme happiness as having to do with honors conferred
for bravery during battle; hunters, with the abundance of game;
sensualists, with voluptuous delights. While still dominated by
matter, people can only comprehend spiritual matters imperfectly
and imagine a picture of future punishment and pleasure that is
more physical than spiritual – they believe they must eat and drink
in that other world as in this one, but in a better manner.7 Later,
regarding people’s beliefs about the future life, we find a mixture of
7

spiritualism and materialism: on one side, contemplative beatitude;
on the other, a hell with physical tortures.
       2. Since they could only understand what they could actually
see, early peoples naturally molded their future on the present. In
order to comprehend things beyond those they could see right in front
of them, they had to evolve intellectually, which could only occur
over time. Moreover, their picture of future punishments was nothing
but a reflection of the ills of humankind, but in greater proportion,
bringing together all the tortures, punishments and afflictions found
on earth. Therefore, in hot climes they imagined a hell of fire; in frigid
regions, a hell of ice. Since they had not yet developed the sense that
would later lead them to comprehend the spirit world, they could
only conceive of physical punishments; thus, with small differences as
to form, the hells of all religions actually resembled one another.

Christian Hell as an Imitation of Pagan Hell
       3. The pagan hell described and dramatized by the poets was
the grandest model of its kind. It was perpetuated by Christians, who
had their own bards. In comparing the two hells, one finds in both –
except for names and variations in detail – numerous similarities. Both
have physical fire as their element of torment, because fire symbolizes
the most atrocious means of suffering. But an odd thing! Christians
exaggerated pagan hell at several points. Although pagans had the
bottomless barrel of the Danaides8, the wheel of Ixion9 and the stone of
Sisyphus10, these images represented individual torments. Christians,

8
     “... (in Greek myth) the 50 daughters of Danaus, 49 of whom were condemned to pour
     water forever into a leaky vessel for having murdered their husbands.” (Random House
     Webster’s College Dictionary, 1991) – Tr.
9
     “A legendary Thessalian king whom Zeus punished for his attempted seduction of Hera by
     binding him to an eternally revolving wheel in Tartarus.” (ibid) – Tr.
10
     “A legendary ruler of Corinth punished in Tartarus by being compelled to roll to the top of
     a slope a stone that always escaped him and rolled back down again.” (idid) – Tr.



                                               44

                                               Hell


on the other hand, held ready for everybody their boiling caldrons,
whose lids the angels lift up in order to look in on the contortions
of the damned.11 And God listens pitilessly to their wailings for all
eternity. The pagans, in contrast, never described the gods of the
Elysian Fields as enjoying the sight of the damned in Tartarus.12
       4. Like the pagans, Christians have their king of hell –
Satan – with the difference, however, that Pluto13 was limited
solely to governing the ghostly empire that he had received as
his share. Although he himself was not evil in nature, he held in
his kingdom those who had practiced evil, because that was his
mission. Furthermore, he did not try to induce people to sin in
order to exult in their suffering. Satan, on the other hand, recruits
victims everywhere and thrills at tormenting them with a legion
of demons armed with pitchforks used to turn them over in the
fire. The nature of that fire, perpetually burning without ever
consuming its victims, has been a topic for serious discussion, and
it has even been debated as to whether or not it might be a fire of
bitumen.14 Thus, pagan hell has nothing over on Christian hell.
       5. The same reasons that led the ancients to physically
localize the kingdom of happiness also led them to circumscribe
the place of torment. Having placed the former in the upper
regions, it was natural to reserve for the latter the lower regions,
that is, the center of the earth, to which they believed certain
terrifying dark caverns served as the entrance. The center of the
earth is also where Christians throughout time have placed the
habitation of the damned.

     even remain filled with joy, and will render thanks to God for their own bliss while watching
     the ineffable calamity of the impious.” (St. Thomas Aquinas) – Auth.

                        Part One - Chapter IV


       Let us draw another analogy regarding the matter: The
hell of the pagans contained the Elysian Fields on one side,
and Tartarus on the other; Olympus, the home of the gods
and divinized human beings, remained in the upper regions.
According to the letter of the Gospel, Jesus descended into hell,
that is, to the lower places, to remove the souls of the righteous
who had awaited his coming. Hell was therefore not solely a
place of torment; like pagan hell, it was simply a place in the
lower regions. Like Olympus, the home of the angels and saints
was in the higher realms. It was placed beyond the starry sky,
which itself was believed to be limited.
       6. This mixture of Christian and pagan ideas is not
surprising. Jesus could not destroy deeply-rooted beliefs in a single
blow, since people lacked the knowledge required to conceive of
the infinity of space and the infinite number of worlds. To them,
the earth was the center of the universe and they knew nothing
about its shape or internal structure. Everything was limited to
their point of view, and thus notions about the future could not
go beyond their understanding. Jesus, therefore, meeting with the
impossibility of initiating them into the true state of things, and
not wanting to use his authority to sanction accepted prejudices,
abstained from rectifying these concepts, leaving that mission
to the passage of time. He limited himself to speaking in vague
terms about the life of the blessed and the punishments reserved
for the guilty, without ever referring in his teachings to the bodily
punishment and torment which for Christians have comprised an
article of faith.
       That is how pagan ideas of hell have continued up until
our day. The spreading of modern knowledge and the overall
development of human intelligence were needed in order to
shed a correcting light on the matter. However, since nothing
positive came forward to replace entrenched ideas, the long


                                 46

                                                Hell


period dominated by blind belief was followed by a transitional
period of disbelief. The New Revelation15 has come to put an
end to it. It was necessary to demolish in order to rebuild, since
it is easier to instill correct ideas in those who do not believe
in anything, but who nonetheless perceive that something is
missing, than to instill them in those who possess a robust
though absurd faith.
       7. By localizing heaven and hell, Christian sects were led to
believe that there were only two extreme situations for souls: perfect
bliss or absolute suffering. Purgatory is only an intermediate and
temporary position, from which souls pass without transition to the
abode of the righteous. There could be no other hypothesis, given
the belief in the definitive fate of the soul after death. If there are
no more than two habitations – that of the elect and that of the
damned – one cannot accept the idea that there are several degrees in
each one without accepting the possibility of ascending up through
them and, consequently, progressing. Thus, if there is progress, there
can be no definitive fate, whereas if there is a definitive fate, there
can be no progress. Jesus resolved the issue when he stated, “There
are many dwelling places in my Father’s house.”16

                                           Limbo
      8. It is true that the Church admits to a special position
in certain cases. Children who die at a very young age without
having committed any evil cannot be condemned to eternal fire,
but since they have not done any good either, they are not entitled
to supreme bliss. Thus, the Church says they remain in limbo:
that undefined situation in which, although they do not suffer,

                                   Part One - Chapter IV


neither do they enjoy blessedness.17 However, since their fate is
irreversibly set, they are deprived of happiness for all eternity. Such
privation therefore implies an eternal and unmerited punishment
even though it is not the result of anything they have done. The
same applies to primitives who, not having received the grace of
baptism and the light of religion, sin out of ignorance by being
driven by natural instincts. Of course, such individuals do not
bear the same responsibility or receive the same merit as those
who act with knowledge of what they do. Simple logic nonetheless
rejects such a doctrine in the name of God’s justice, which is
fully depicted in these words of Christ, “To each according to his
deeds.” It is necessary to understand good or bad deeds as those
that are done intentionally and freely, because only these entail
responsibility. Such cannot be the case with a child, a primitive or
anyone else who has not been enlightened.

                      A Portrayal of Pagan Hell
       9. Knowledge about pagan hell has come to us almost
exclusively through the narratives of the poets. Homer and Virgil
have provided the most complete description, but we must take
into account the poetic necessities imposed on such descriptions.
Fenelon’s description in his Telemachus18 originates from the same
source as the ancients’ fundamental beliefs, but it has the more
precise simplicity of the prose style. It describes the gloomy aspect
of the various places and seeks to specifically emphasize the types of
17
     In a 41-page document published by the Catholic News Service, the Roman Catholic
     Church annulled the concept of limbo. The document states, “People find it increasingly
     difficult to accept that God is just and merciful if he excludes infants... from eternal
     happiness, whether they are Christian or non-Christian.” The document appears in Vol. 36,

     Francois Fenelon was born in 1651 into an aristocratic but impoverished family. Ordained
     a priest at a young age, he became tutor of Louis XIV’s grandson, the Duc de Bourgogne. It
     was for this royal student that Fenelon wrote The Adventures of Telemachus in 1693-4. Tr.



                                               48

suffering to which the guilty are submitted. Fenelon extends such
sufferings to the fate of evil kings with a view to instructing his royal
disciple. As popular as this work is, many persons may not be able to
recall its description of hell, or they may not have reflected enough
on it to make a comparison. Thus, we believe it would be useful to
reproduce the sections that most directly bear on our subject, that is,
those that refer specifically to individual punishments.19
        10. Telemachus enters and hears the wailings of an
inconsolable shade.20 “What is your disgrace?” he asks. “Who were
you while on earth?” “Nabopharzam,” replies the shade, “king of
proud Babylon. Upon hearing my name, all the peoples of the
East trembled with fear. I commanded that I be worshipped by
the Babylonians in a temple of ivory, where I was represented by
a statue of gold; the most precious incense from Ethiopia burned
before it day and night. No one ever dared contradict me without
being quickly punished. New pleasures were created every day to
render my life more and more delightful.
        “I was young and robust. Alas! So much opulence still
remained for me to enjoy while on the throne! However, a certain
woman whom I loved, but who didn’t love me, made it very clear
to me that I was no god – she poisoned me, and now I am no
more. My ashes were ceremoniously buried yesterday in a gold
urn. People wept and pulled their hair. They feigned throwing
themselves on the flames of my pyre in order to die with me, and
they will continue to come to weep together at the superb tomb
of my ashes – but none will truly mourn for me. My memory

     Shade: “The insubstantial remains of the dead, a phantom without a body or the power
     of thought. This was the form in which the newly deceased congregated on the infernal
     shore of the River Styx, awaiting passage in the boat of Charon the ferryman to the
     kingdom of Hades, ruler of the Underworld. Those who lacked the proper bribe for Charon
     were condemned to wander the near bank of the river Styx for eternity. Even those who
     gained their passage had little to look forward to except a bleak and bloodless existence.”

terrorizes my own family, while here below I am now suffering
horrible torment.”
       Shaken by this dramatic tale, Telemachus asks him, “Were
you truly happy during your reign? Did you feel that sweet peace
without which the heart stays oppressed and disheartened even
though it is in the midst of delight?” “No,” the Babylonian
responds, “I don’t even know what you’re talking about. Sages
praise that sort of peace as the sole good, but I myself never felt
it. My heart was always being stirred up by new desires, fears
and hopes. I sought to benumb myself in the turbulence of
my passions, employing ways to feed their turmoil in order to
make them permanent and uninterrupted. The smallest pause to
reason calmly would have been too much. That was the peace I
enjoyed; any other would have seemed like a fable, a dream. Such
are the things I regret.”
       Having spoken thus, the Babylonian weeps like a weakling
who has been left debilitated by too much prosperity and
hence unable to bear disgrace with resignation. At his side are
some slaves who had been put to death in honor of his funeral.
Mercury had delivered them to Charon21 along with the king.
They are endowed with absolute power over him whom they
had served while on earth. These slave shades are not at all afraid
of Nabopharzam’s shade, which they hold enchained, inflicting it
with the cruelest humiliations. One says to him, “Weren’t we men
like you? How could you have been so insensitive to the point of
forgetting your common origin with all men?” Another insults
him, “You were right for not wanting to regard yourself as a mere
man – you were a monster deprived of humanity.” And another,
“So! Where are your flattering admirers now? You no longer have
anything to give, you wretch! Now, you can’t even commit evil

and you have been reduced to being a slave to your slaves. The
justice of the gods is slow in coming, but it does not fail.”
        At these harsh statements, Nabopharzam throws himself face
down on the ground, pulling at his hair in an explosion of anger and
desperation. But Charon tells the slaves, “Pull him up by his chain;
make him stand up against his will. He must not console himself by
being able to hide his shame. All the shades of the Styx must behold him
that they may recognize the justice of the gods, who for too long
tolerated the reign of this impious man on earth.”
        Soon thereafter, Telemachus perceives dark Tartarus nearby,
emitting black, heavy smoke; its noxious odor would cause death if
it spread to the domain of the living. This smoke covers a river of
fire, a vortex of flame, whose roar is like that of the mightiest torrents
of water when they fall from the highest rocks into deep abysses. It is
so loud that no one can hear anything in that dark place.
        Telemachus, secretly influenced by Minerva22, fearlessly
enters the precipice. First, he notices a large number of individuals
who had lived in the most humble conditions. They are now being
punished for having sought wealth through fraud, betrayal and
cruelty. He also notices many impious hypocrites who, pretending
to love religion, had used it as a pretext to satisfy their ambitions
and deceive the credulous. These had abused even Virtue itself, the
greatest gift of the gods, and they are being punished as the most
perverted of all human beings. Children who slew their parents,
wives who stained their hands with the blood of their husbands,
traitors who sold out their countries after violating all oaths – all
these are suffering less punishment than those hypocrites.
        The three infernal judges had ordered it to be so for this
reason: hypocrites are not content with being evil like other
impious individuals, but want to be taken for good persons.

Through their false virtue, they cause people to stop believing in
truth. Having been mocked and despised by these individuals, the
gods now take pleasure in doing everything within their power to
avenge such insults.
       Next to the hypocrites, other individuals appear, who
loudly proclaim themselves absent of blame, but whom the gods
persecute mercilessly. These are the ingrates, liars and flatterers
who worshipped vice; the perverse critics who sought to tarnish
the purest virtue. Finally, there are those who, rashly judging
matters without knowing the full story, thereby harmed the
reputations of innocent men.
       Upon seeing the three judges seated and passing sentence on
a certain man, Telemachus takes the chance to ask them what his
crimes were. The condemned man immediately exclaims, “I never
did anything evil. I always took great pleasure in doing good. I was
magnanimous, generous, just and compassionate. What are you
accusing me of?” Then Minos23 says to him, “No accusation is being
made against you as far as men are concerned; however, did you not
owe less to them than to the gods? What is this justice of which you
boast? You did not fail in any of your duties regarding other men,
who are nothing. You were certainly virtuous, but you attributed
all your virtue to yourself and not to the gods, who had bestowed it
upon you; instead, you wanted to enjoy the fruit of your virtue as
something of your own: you were your own god. However, the gods,
who made everything solely for themselves, cannot renounce their
rights. You forgot them; thus, they forgot you. They handed you
over to yourself, since you preferred to belong to yourself and not to
them. Seek now, if you can, consolation within your own heart. Now
and forever you shall be separated from those whom you wanted
to please; you are left to your self, your true idol. Know that there

     Minotaur.” (ibid) – Tr.

is no true virtue without respect and love for the gods, to whom
everything is due. Your false virtue, which for so many years deceived
the naïve, shall be unmasked. Men only judge vice and virtue by
what will either please or inconvenience them – they are blind as to
both good and evil. Here, a divine light tears down their artificial
judgments, often condemning what they admired while justifying
what they condemned.”
       At these words, the philosopher, as though struck by
lightening, can hardly contain himself. The satisfaction that he
formerly had in contemplating his own moderation, courage and
generous inclinations is transformed into desperation. The sight of
his own heart as an enemy of the gods becomes a torment for him.
He sees himself as he really is and cannot escape it. He sees the vanity
of the judgment of the men whom he had sought to flatter in all his
actions. A radical transformation is occurring within him as if all
his innards are being overturned. He is no longer the same. He can
no longer find support within his own heart. His conscience, whose
judgment use to be so favorable toward him, now turns against him,
bitterly incriminating the folly and illusion of all his virtues, which
from the beginning did not have the worship of the Divinity as their
goal. He is confused and dismayed, filled with shame, regret and
desperation. The Furies do not have to torment him, for it is enough
that he be handed over to himself so that his own heart can sufficiently
avenge the displeased gods.
       He searches for darkness in which to hide himself but cannot
find it, for a persistent light follows him everywhere. On all sides,
its penetrating rays of truth avenge the truth he neglected to
follow. Everything he formerly loved has become odious to him
as the source of his unending ills. He murmurs to himself, “You
fool! You knew neither the gods nor your fellow beings nor
yourself! No, you never loved the true and sole good. All your
steps were misguided; your wisdom was only madness; your


                                  53

                          Part One - Chapter IV


virtue was no more than impious and blind pride – you were
your own idol in the end!”
       Telemachus next perceives some kings who had been
condemned because they had abused their power. On one side, an
avenging Fury shows them a mirror reflecting the monstrosity of their
vices. They cannot help but see their gross vanity and their greed
for foolhardy praise; their cruelty towards those whom they should
have made happy; their insensitivity toward virtue; their fear of
the truth; their predilection for cowards and flatterers; their lack
of responsibility; their idleness, indolence and unlimited distrust;
their pomp and their excessive luxury at the expense and ruin of
their people; their ambition for vain glories at the cost of the blood
of their subjects; finally, their cruelty in each day seeking new
pleasures in the tears and desperation of such misfortunate people.
These kings see themselves in that mirror incessantly. They see
that they were more monstrous and horrendous than the Chimera
defeated by Bellerophon, the Hydra of Lerna struck down by
Hercules, or Cerberus vomiting through his three mouths a black
and poisonous blood capable of contaminating all the races of
mortals who lived upon the earth.
       On the other side and at the same time, another Fury
insultingly repeats all the praises that flatterers had heaped upon
the kings during their lives, while showing them another mirror
in which they see how such flatterers really regarded them. The
contradiction between the two pictures comprises a torment to their
vanity. He notices that the worst among these kings are the ones
who had received the most glittering praise during their lifetimes,
because evil kings are more feared than good ones and shamelessly
demand the lying adulations of the poets and orators of their day.
       In the depths of that darkness, where they only suffer insults and
derision, they hear the agonizing groans of the suffering. Everything
around them repels and confuses them and conflicts with them: a


                                   54

                                 Hell


stark contrast to what they had believed about themselves during
their lifetimes, deceiving others and convinced that everything had
been made to serve them. In Tartarus, they were handed over to the
caprice of a few slaves who now subject them in turn to the cruelest
servitude. They serve these tormenters with no hope of even one
day to soften their captivity. They remain subject to the blows of
these slaves – who have become their merciless tyrants – like an anvil
under the hammers of the Cyclopes as Vulcan coerces them to work
in the fiery forges of Mount Etna.
       There, Telemachus sees pale, hideous and disconsolate
specters. A dark sadness consumes those criminals. They are
horrified of themselves but are no more capable of freeing
themselves from this horror than from their very own nature. They
have no need for any other punishment for their wrongs than those
very wrongs, which they now see incessantly before them in all their
fullness in the form of terrible ghosts pursuing them. In trying to
free themselves of the persecution, they search for a death more
powerful than what had separated them from their bodies. In their
desperation, they invoke a death capable of extinguishing their
awareness altogether. They ask the abysses to swallow them up
so that they might escape the avenging rays of truth that torment
them; however, they are nonetheless condemned to the vengeance
that drips down upon them drop by drop never to cease. The truth
they hated to behold comprises their punishment; they see it standing
against them now, wounding them, destroying them, tearing them
from themselves like lightning, not destroying them outwardly
but penetrating to their deepest innards.
       Among the beings that are making his hair stand on end,
Telemachus sees several ancient kings of Lydia being punished for
having preferred the pleasures of an inactive life instead of one of
service. They should have worked for the relief of their people, a
duty inseparable from royalty.


                                 55

                       Part One - Chapter IV


       These kings are reproving one another for their blindness.
One says to another who had been his son, “Didn’t I often
recommend in my old age and before dying that you atone for
the evils that occurred due to my negligence?” “Ah! Wretched
father!” says his son, “It was you who caused me ruin! It was your
example that inspired me to ostentation, pride and luxuriousness,
to cruelty towards others! Seeing you rule with such recklessness
and surrounded by shameless flatterers, I grew accustomed to
enjoying flattery and pleasure myself. I believed that other men
are to kings what horses and other beasts of burden are to men;
that is, animals that are only useful as long as they can provide
service and convenience. I believed this and it was you who led
me to believe it. Now I am suffering all these evils for having
taken after you.” To these reciprocal recriminations they add the
most acerbic blasphemies and seem ready to tear each other to
pieces out of rage.
       Like nighttime birds of prey, around the kings hover the
cruel suspicions, the hopeless fears, the distrust that avenges the
cruelty they used to impose on their people, the insatiable hunger
for wealth, the always-tyrannical false glory, and their accursed
indolence, doubling all the ills they could possibly suffer and
incapable of providing them any sure enjoyment.
       A number of these kings are being severely punished not
for the evils they had committed but for having neglected doing
the good they could and should have done. All the crimes of their
people that resulted from negligence in observing the laws have
been imputed to these kings, who should have ruled only to make
sure these laws were obeyed under their reign. Also imputed to
them is all the disorder resulting from pomp, luxury and the other
excesses that drive men to violence, inciting them to acquiring
things by breaking the law. Those who are being treated most
severely are the ones who, instead of being good and watchful


                                56

                                              Hell


shepherds of their people, only cared about devouring their flock
like insatiable wolves.
       What saddens Telemachus most, however, is seeing in that
abyss of darkness and evil a great number of kings who, although
having passed upon the earth as very good rulers, have been
condemned to the punishment of Tartarus for having allowed
themselves to be guided by evil and hypocritical individuals.
This punishment corresponds to the evils they had allowed to be
committed in the name of their authority. Furthermore, most
of these kings were neither good nor evil – that was their
weakness. They never feared not knowing the truth, and thus
never experienced the pleasure of virtue and never felt the
pleasure of practicing the good.

                   An Outline of Christian Hell
       11. Theologians’ idea of hell may be summed up in the
following citations.24 This description is taken from sacred
authors and the lives of the saints, and may be regarded as the
best expression of the orthodox faith on the matter because it is
reproduced all the time and with few variations in sermons from
evangelistic pulpits and in pastoral teachings.
       12. “Demons are merely spirits, and the condemned who
are now in hell may also be regarded merely as spirits, since only
the soul descends to that place; the bodily remains are given back
to the earth to be transformed into grasses, plants, minerals and
liquids, unconsciously undergoing the constant metamorphoses of
matter. However, the condemned, like the saints, must come back
to life on the final judgment day by assuming the same bodies
in which they had been known during life, never to leave them

24
     These citations are taken from a work entitled Hell by Augusto Callet – Auth.



                                               57

                        Part One - Chapter IV


again. What will characterize them is that the elect will return to
life in purified and resplendent bodies, whereas the condemned
will take on stained bodies disfigured by sin; thus, there will no
longer be pure spirits in hell, but men like us. Consequently,
hell is a physical, geographical and material place, since it will be
populated by terrestrial creatures who have feet, hands, mouths,
tongues, teeth, ears and eyes like ours, in addition to blood in their
veins and nerves that feel.
       “Where might this hell be? Some doctors of the Church
have located it within the very entrails of our globe; others on
some unknown planet. But the problem has never been resolved
by any ecclesiastical council. Hence, we are reduced to pure
conjecture on the matter. The only thing we can confirm is that
this hell – wherever it may be – is a world composed of physical
elements, but without any sun, stars or moon; more sorrowful and
inhospitable, more devoid of any sprout of life and any appearance
of the good than the most uninhabitable regions of this world on
which we sin.
       “The most prudent theologians do not dare describe the
horrors of that abode in the way the Egyptians, Hindus and Greeks
have, but rather limit themselves to portraying it according to the
few descriptions given in the Scriptures, which depict it as: the
lake of fire and brimstone of the Apocalypse; the worms of Isaiah,
which feed forever on the dead bodies of Tophet; the demons
tormenting the men whom they managed to lead into perdition;
and the humans weeping and gnashing their teeth, according to
the expression of the Evangelists.
       “St. Augustine does not agree that these physical sufferings
are merely reflections of mental sufferings. He sees a real lake of
sulfur with real worms and real serpents attacking all the parts of
the bodies of the condemned and adding their bites to the fire.
Drawing upon a verse in St. Mark, he claims that although this


                                 58

                                Hell


strange fire is as physical as ours and acts upon physical bodies, it
nonetheless preserves them in the same way that salt preserves the
bodies of victims. The condemned will feel the torture of that fire
that burns without destroying; it will penetrate their skin, it will
permeate and saturate all their body parts, the marrow of their
bones, the pupils of their eyes, the most recondite and sensitive
fibers of their being. If they could immerse themselves in the crater
of a volcano, it would seem like a cool and restful place.
       “Thus speak the most timid, discreet and modest theologians
with complete confidence. They do not deny that there may be
other bodily punishments in hell, but they say they lack sufficient
knowledge to affirm it, at least as far as it concerns the awful
punishment of fire and worms. However, there are more daring
or more enlightened theologians who provide the most detailed,
varied and complete descriptions of hell. And even though they do
not know where in space this hell is situated, there are saints who
claim to have seen it. They did not go there with a lyre in their
hands like Orpheus, or a sword like Ulysses, but were transported
there in spirit. St. Teresa belongs to this group.
       “According to this saint’s report, there is a city in hell –
at least she saw a sort of long, narrow alley like those that are
plentiful in old cities – and she walked down it, horrified,
stepping on slimy, fetid ground covered with monstrous reptiles.
However, she was detained on her walk by a wall that crossed the
alley. In this wall there was a niche, where she sheltered herself,
but without being able to explain how she did so. She said that
the place was meant for her if during her life she abused the
grace granted to her by God in her cell at Avila. In spite of the
extraordinary ease with which she entered this stone niche, she
was unable to sit down, lie down or stand up; still less could she
leave. Its horrifying walls began to close in upon her, surrounding
her and pressing in upon her as if under their own power. She


                                 59

                                    Part One - Chapter IV


felt like they were suffocating and strangling her, while at the
same time flaying and chopping her into pieces. She felt herself
burning and experienced every kind of anguish imaginable all at
the same time.
        “With no hope of rescue, there was nothing but darkness
surrounding her, and yet, across that darkness, she was amazed
to perceive the hideous alley where she found herself, as well as
its filthy surroundings – a spectacle as unbearable to her as the
confines of her prison.25
        “This was undoubtedly no more than a tiny corner of hell.
Other spirit wanderers have been more fortunate, because they
have seen great cities in hell resembling huge braziers: Babylon and
Nineveh – even Rome itself – with their palaces and temples on
fire and their inhabitants in chains; dealers at their counters, priests
with their courtesans in festive rooms, tied screaming in chairs
from which they could not free themselves, and raising flaming
goblets to their parched lips; servants on their knees in boiling
sewers with arms outstretched to princes, from whose hands
flowed a lava stream of molten gold. Others have seen unending
plains in hell, tilled by starving farmers. These fields smolder with
their sweat, and because the seeds they sow are sterile, they harvest
nothing and thus turn to devouring one another. Afterwards, as
numerous as before and still wraith-like and starving, they leave in
bands toward the horizon in a futile search for a happier land, and
their abandoned fields are immediately refilled by other wandering
colonies of condemned souls. Still others report having seen hell
as a place of precipice-surrounded mountains, groaning forests,
dry wells, fountains fed by tears, streams of blood, snowstorms
in deserts of ice or boats manned by desperate men sailing across
unending oceans. In other words, they have seen everything that

25
     In this vision we can recognize all the characteristics of nightmares, and it is probable that
     St. Teresa was experiencing one of those phenomena. – Auth.



                                                 60

                                               Hell


the pagans used to see: a dark reflection of earth, an immeasurably
increased projection of its miseries, with its respective natural
sufferings eternalized; even dungeons, scaffolds and instruments
of torture forged by one’s own hands.
       “There are also demons who take on bodies in order to
better torment men in their bodies. Some have bat wings, horns,
scaly hides, hooves with claws and sharpened teeth, presenting
themselves armed with swords, pitchforks, pincers, burning
clippers, saws, grills, bludgeons and bellows – everything fiery
hot – not fulfilling any other task for all eternity other than that of
butchers and cooks of human flesh. Other demons, transformed
into lions or huge vipers, haul their prey off to lonely caves; some
transform themselves into ravens to pluck out the eyes of certain
guilty souls; still others, into flying dragons to carry their terrorized,
screaming and bloody victims on their backs across dark spaces
to cast them into lakes of brimstone. There are clouds of locusts
and gigantic scorpions, the sight of which produces nausea and
chills, and the contact of which causes convulsions. Multi-headed
monsters open voracious gullets wide and shake the manes of asps
that adorn their deformed heads as they crunch the condemned
with bloody mandibles and then vomit them out all chewed up
but alive – for they are immortal.
       “These demons in tangible form, who so graphically bring
to mind the gods of Amenti and Tartarus, as well as the idols
worshiped by the Phoenicians, Moabites and other neighboring
peoples of Judea, do not act by chance, however – all have their
function and objective. The evil they practice in hell is related
to the evil they formerly inspired and instigated on earth.26 The
condemned are punished in all their organs and senses because
26
     This power to continue practicing on a larger scale the evil done on a lesser scale while on
     earth is a peculiar punishment! It would seem more rational for them to suffer at the hands
     of their own malefactors as a consequence of the evil they committed on earth, rather
     than being given the pleasure of inflicting it upon others. – Auth.



                                                61

                                   Part One - Chapter IV


they offended God through all their organs and senses. The
transgressors of gluttony are punished by demons of gluttony, the
lazy by those of laziness, the fornicators by those of fornication, and
so forth, in as great a variety as there are sins. They feel cold while
burning and hot while freezing. They desire rest and movement at
the same time; they will always be thirsty and starving, they will be
a thousand times wearier than slaves at the end of the day, sicker
than the dying, feebler and more ulcerated than martyrs – forever.
        “No demon refuses or will ever refuse to carry out its dreadful
task. In this sense, all of them are well disciplined and faithful in
fulfilling the orders of vengeance they have received. Without this,
what would hell become? Reprobates would rest if their torturers
quarreled or became weary. However, there is neither rest nor
quarreling among them, for no matter how evil and numerous
they are, demons understand each other from one extreme of
the abyss to the other. No one in earth’s realms has ever seen an
organization of subjects more obedient to their princes, armies
more obedient to their commanders or monastic communities
more humbly submissive to their superiors.27
        “Almost nothing is known about the demoniac mob, those
despicable spirits that make up the legions of vampires, toads,
scorpions, crows, hydras, salamanders and other nameless animals
that constitute the fauna of those infernal regions. However, the
names of many of the princes that command such legions are
known, among whom are Belfegor, demon of wealth; Abaddon or
Appolion, of murder; Beelzebub, demon of impure desires or lord
27
     These same demons, who are rebels against God concerning the good, display exemplary
     obedience as they perform their evil tasks. None of them has ever refused their duties or
     slowed down, nor will they for all eternity. What an odd metamorphosis has taken place in
     these beings who were created pure and perfect like the angels! Isn’t it certainly strange
     to see them provide an example of perfect understanding, full harmony and unalterable
     concordance, whereas humans do not even know how to live in peace on earth, but tear
     at each other constantly? Upon seeing the refinement of the punishments reserved for
     the condemned and in comparing their situation to that of the demons, one must ask who
     are more deserving of pity: the victims or the executioners – Auth.

of the flies, who engenders corruption; Mammon, of greed. There
are Molloch, Belial, Baalgad, Ashteroth and many others, not to
mention the supreme chief, the glum archangel, who in heaven is
called Lucifer and in hell, Satan.
       “Thus, we have summed up the idea given to us about hell
from the point of view of its physical nature and also from the
physical punishments that are suffered there. Examine the writings
of the Fathers and the ancient doctors of the Church; question
the holy legends; observe the sculptures and frontal pieces of our
churches; pay attention to what is said from the pulpits, and you
will learn even more.”
       13. The author accompanies this picture with the following
reflections. Everyone will comprehend their scope:
       “The resurrection of the body is a miracle in and of itself,
but God performs yet a second miracle by giving the dead body –
already once used for the temporary trials of life and already
once destroyed – a quality of subsistence that keeps if from being
dissolved in a furnace that would vaporize even metals. We can
comprehend the fact that the soul is its own executioner, that God
does not persecute it but only abandons it to the unhappy state that
it has chosen for itself, but the eternal abandonment of a disgraced
and suffering being seems incompatible with the goodness of the
Creator. However, what may be said about the soul and spiritual
punishment can in no way be said about the body and corporeal
punishment. In order to make corporeal punishment last forever,
it would not be enough for God merely to withdraw his divine
hand; on the contrary, he would have to show it, to intervene and
to act; otherwise the body would be destroyed.
       “Theologians assume, therefore, that after the resurrection of
our bodies, God, in effect, performs that second miracle of which we
spoke. First, he takes our bodies of clay from the grave that devoured
them; he brings them back the way they were when they were lowered


                                 63

                         Part One - Chapter IV


into it, with their original infirmities and degradations resulting
from age, illness and vice. He restores us to that state – decrepit,
cold, gouty, full of needs, sensitive to a bee’s sting, all covered with
the wounds that life and death had imprinted on us – this is the first
miracle. Next, into these miserable bodies, ready to return to the
dust from which they came, God infuses a property they had never
possessed: immortality – that same gift that in his anger, or rather,
in his mercy, he took away from Adam when he expelled him from
Eden – and there we have the second miracle. While Adam was
immortal, he was invulnerable; when he ceased being invulnerable,
he became mortal. Death closely followed through pain.
        “Resurrection, therefore, neither returns us to the physical
state of innocent men nor to the physical state of the guilty. It is
merely a resurrection of our former miseries, but with the extra
burden of new ones that are infinitely more horrific. In some ways,
it is a true creation, and the most malicious that the imagination
has dared to conceive. God changes his mind, and in order to add
to sinners’ spiritual torments the physical torments that will last
forever, he changes, all at once and through an effect of his power,
the laws and properties that he himself established at the very
beginning for the components of matter. He resuscitates infirm
and decaying flesh, merging into an indestructible union those
elements which, when left to themselves, tend to separate from
each other, and in doing so, he maintains and perpetuates this
living rot of flesh against the natural order. He casts this living dust
into the fire, not to purify it but to keep it such as it is: sensitive,
suffering, burning, horrible, and just as he wills it to be – immortal.
        “Through this miracle, God makes himself into one of the
infernal executioners, for if the condemned can only attribute their
spiritual ills to themselves, in compensation they can only impute
their physical woes to God. Apparently, it is not enough after death
for God to abandon them to the sadness, the regret and the anguish


                                  64

                                              Hell


of a soul that feels it has lost the supreme good. On that night –
according to theologians – God will go looking for them at the
bottom of the abyss, momentarily calling them back to life, not in
order to console them but to re-clothe them with a horrendous,
burning and imperishable body that is more tainted than the tunic
of Dejanira28; it is only then that he abandons them forever.
        “But even then he does not actually abandon them, because
hell, like heaven and earth, cannot subsist apart from the permanent
act of his always-active will; everything would vanish if he ceased to
sustain it. Consequently, God will keep his hand unceasingly upon
the condemned in order to keep the fires from going out and their
bodies from being consumed, willing those unfortunate immortals
to contribute their eternal torture to the edification of the elect.”
        14. We have rightly stated that Christian hell exceeds pagan
hell. In fact, in Tartarus we see that the guilty are tortured by
remorse, and always in the presence of their victims and in light of
their crimes. They are humiliated by those whom they had harmed
while they were alive. We see the guilty fleeing from the light that
penetrates them and trying in vain to hide from the eyes that
follow them. Their pride is brought down and humiliated there,
and all bear the stigmas of their past; all are punished for their own
wrongs to the point that for some it is sufficient to leave them to
themselves, since it would be pointless to inflict them with any
further punishments. However, they are shades, that is, souls with
fluidic bodies: an image of their earthly life. In Tartarus, we neither
see humans who have returned with their bodies of flesh to suffer
physically nor the fire that penetrates their skin, saturating them
to the marrow of their bones; nor do we see the lavishness and
refinement of the tortures that comprise the depths of Christian

     Nessus the centaur was killed by Hercules for attempting to rape his bride Dejanira. Before
     dying, Nessus gave Dejanira his bloody tunic, telling her to give it to Hercules if he was
     unfaithful, and his affections would return. When she did this the shirt stuck to Hercules’

hell. In pagan hell, we find unbending but just judges who adjust
the degree of punishment to the wrong, whereas in Satan’s empire
the condemned all are immersed in the same tortures. Everything
there is based on materiality; any fairness is completely banished.
       Nowadays, in the midst of the same Church, there are of
course many reasonable individuals who no longer take such
things literally, but who see them rather as simple allegories whose
meanings require interpretation. Nevertheless, such opinions
are individual and not the rule; the belief in physical hell and its
consequences continues to constitute an article of faith.
       15. We might ask how persons could have seen such things
while in an ecstatic state if they do not in fact exist. It is not our
place here to explain the source of those astonishing images, which
are sometimes produced with an appearance of reality. We will only
state that in principle one must remember that ecstasy is the most
uncertain of all revelatory means29, because such a state of over-
excitement does not always result in as complete a detachment of the
soul as one might believe, and in it we often encounter a reflection
of our waking-state preoccupations. The ideas with which the spirit
is nourished, and of which the brain – or, rather, the perispiritual
envelope corresponding to the brain – retains the form or stamp,
are reproduced and amplified in a mirage of vaporous forms that
develop and mix together to make up strange combinations. Ecstatics
of all creeds have always seen things in keeping with the faith they
espouse; consequently, it comes as no surprise that ecstatics like St.
Teresa were saturated with infernal ideas resulting from the verbal
and written descriptions they had received, and had visions that
were not, properly speaking, any more than reproductions of such
ideas, thereby producing the effect of a nightmare. A devout pagan
would have seen Tartarus and the Furies, just as he or she would
have seen Jupiter on Olympus with a lightning bolt in his hand.

                                M

                       Purgatory
       1. The Gospels make no mention of purgatory, a doctrine
that was only accepted by the Church in 593. It is incontestably a
more rational dogma and more in accord with the justice of God
than is hell, for it establishes less-harsh penalties and allows for the
redemption of less-serious wrongs.
       The principle of purgatory is thus founded on equity,
because, if compared to human justice, it resembles temporary
detention rather than a life sentence. After all, what would we
think of a country that imposed the death penalty for all crimes,
even simple misdemeanors? Without purgatory, there are only two
extremes for souls: supreme bliss or eternal torture. According to
such a theory, however, what happens to souls who are guilty only
of petty wrongs? Either they must share in the bliss of the elect
without having been perfected, or suffer the punishment of the
worst criminals without having committed such evil. That would
be neither just nor reasonable.
       2. However, the idea of purgatory was necessarily
incomplete, because, knowing only punishment by fire, purgatory
was conceived as an attenuated version of hell. Hence, souls in
purgatory also burn, but in a less intense fire. And since progress
is incompatible with the dogma of eternal punishment, souls in
purgatory cannot free themselves by improving themselves, but
only by prayers which are said for them or which are paid for to


                                  67

                                   Part One - Chapter V


be said on their behalf. And if the idea was good at first, the same
does not apply to its consequences; i.e., the abuses it caused. The
paying for prayers transformed purgatory into a more profitable
goldmine than hell.30
       3. The location of purgatory and the nature of the penalties
endured there were never determined. It was reserved for the New
Revelation to fill in this gap by explaining the causes of the earthly
miseries of life, for which only the plurality of existences could
possibly show us justice.
       Such miseries necessarily result from the imperfections of
the soul, since, if it were already perfect, it would neither commit
any wrongs nor have to suffer their consequences. Those who on
earth are completely sober and moderate, for example, will not
suffer infirmities arising from excess. Most of the time, people
are misfortunate because of their own fault; however, if they are
imperfect, it must be because they were that way before coming to
earth. Here, they expiate not only their current wrongs, but also
previous ones that they could not expiate at the time. They expiate
in one life the hardships they made others endure in a previous
life. The vicissitudes they experience are a temporary correction
and a warning as to the imperfections they must yet eliminate in
order to avoid evil and progress toward the good. They are the
lessons of experience for the soul. They seem cruel at times, but
the deeper the impression they leave, the more profitable they are
for the future. These vicissitudes give incessant rise to the struggles
that develop intellectual and mental powers and faculties. Through
these struggles, the soul reinvigorates itself morally and always
triumphs after having courageously borne them until the end. The
prize for victory is to be found in the spirit life, to which the soul

30
     Purgatory gave rise to the scandalous business of indulgences, through which entrance
     into heaven was paid for. This abuse was the primary cause of the Reformation, and it led
     Luther to reject purgatory altogether. – Auth.



                                              68

                                 Purgatory


radiantly and triumphantly enters like a soldier who has stood out
in battle and now receives the garland.
        4. In each lifetime, an opportunity is presented to the soul to
enable it to take a step forward. The length of this step forward depends
on its will, which enables it to rise several degrees or to remain in the
same place. In the latter case, it will have wasted the opportunity, and
since it will have to pay its debts sooner or later, it will have to re-start
a new existence under even more dolorous conditions, because to any
blemish it has not eradicated, it adds another.
        Therefore, it is through successive incarnations that the soul
rids itself of its imperfections. It purges them – in a word – until it
is sufficiently pure to merit being set free from worlds of expiation
to go to happier ones, leaving these behind still further on to
partake of supreme bliss.
        Consequently, purgatory is not some vague and uncertain
notion; it is a physical reality that we can see, touch and endure.
It is found on worlds of expiation, and earth is one of them. On
earth, people expiate their past and present for the good of their
future. However, contrary to the normal idea on the matter, it
depends on each man or woman to shorten or prolong his or her
stay on this world, according to the degree of evolution and purity
attained through self-effort. We do not leave it behind by having
completed a certain amount of time or because of the merits of
other people, but by our own merit, according to the words of
Christ, “To each according to his deeds,” words that wholly sum
up the justice of God.
        5. Therefore, those who suffer in this life can tell themselves
that it is because they did not sufficiently purify themselves in their
previous existence, and if they do not do so in this one, they will
suffer further in the next. This is at the same time both equitable
and logical. Since suffering is inherent to imperfection, one suffers
for as long as one is imperfect, just as a sick person suffers as long


                                     69

                                       Part One - Chapter V


as he or she does not eliminate the cause of the illness. Thus it is
that as long as those who are proud remain so, they will suffer the
consequences of pride; as long as they are selfish, those of selfishness.
       6. Due to its imperfections, a guilty spirit first suffers in
the spirit life. Afterward, a corporeal life is given to it as a means
of reparation. It is for this reason that it finds itself either with
persons whom it had offended previously, in surroundings similar
to those in which it had practiced evil, or in situations opposite
those it had experienced – for example, poverty if it had used its
wealth badly, or humiliation if it had been proud.
       Expiation in the world of spirits and on the earth does
not comprise a double punishment. Punishment on the earth
complements the punishment begun in the spirit world, and
acts to facilitate progress through effective labor; it depends on
the spirit to take advantage of the opportunity. Isn’t it better for
it to return to earth with the possibility of gaining heaven than
to be condemned without remission once it has left the earth
behind? The granting of this freedom is a proof of the wisdom, the
goodness and the justice of God, who wants all human beings to
put forth all their efforts to be the artisans of their own future; if they
are unhappy for a shorter or longer amount of time, they have no
one to complain about but themselves, for the way of progress is
always open to them.
       7. If we consider how great the suffering is of certain guilty
spirits in the invisible world, how terrible the situation is for some
of them there, to what miseries they have become prey, and how
painful this situation is for them because of their inability to foresee
the end of their suffering, then we could say that they actually are
in hell, if such a word did not imply the idea of an eternal and
physical punishment. However, thanks to the Spirits’31 revelation

31
     When we use the term “the Spirits” with a capital “S”, the text is referring to the group of highly
     evolved spirits who were directly involved in revealing the Spiritist Doctrine per se. – Tr.



                                                   70

                                            Purgatory


and the examples they offer us, we know that the length of expiation
depends on the betterment of the wrongdoer.
       8. Spiritism, therefore, does not deny, but rather confirms
future punishment. What it abolishes is a localized hell with its
furnaces and never-ending torture. It does not deny purgatory – it
shows that we are there at this very moment. It further defines and
outlines this purgatory by explaining the causes of earthly miseries,
thereby leading those who do not believe in it to do so.
       Does it reject prayers for the dead? Quite the contrary, because
suffering spirits ask for them. It elevates prayer to a duty of charity
and demonstrates its effectiveness in leading such spirits to the good,
thereby shortening their torments.32 And since Spiritism addresses
one’s intelligence, it has led many disbelievers to faith, inducing
prayer within the hearts of those who used to scoff at it. What
Spiritism affirms is that the efficacy of prayer is in the thought and
not in the words; that the best prayers are those of the heart and not
of the lips, the ones we say ourselves and not the ones that are said
for money. Therefore, who would dare to criticize prayer?
       9. Whether punishment takes place in the spirit life or on the
earth, and however long it might last, it always has a termination in
the near or distant future. Actually, there are only two alternatives
for a spirit: temporary punishment allotted according to its wrongs,
or recompense awarded according to its merits. Spiritism rejects the
third alternative of eternal condemnation. Hell is reduced to a
symbolic portrayal of the greater sufferings whose end cannot be
foreseen. Purgatory is our present reality.
       The word “purgatory” suggests the idea of an enclosed place;
thus, it is more naturally applied to the earth – considered as a
place of expiation – than to infinite space where suffering spirits
roam around, and also because the nature of earthly expiation is a
true purgation.

        As humans better themselves, they will eventually supply the
invisible world with only good spirits, and when these reincarnate, they
in turn will only supply corporeal humankind with members who are
more purified. Then earth will cease to be an expiatory world, and people
will no longer suffer the miseries resulting from their imperfections.
That is the transformation that is occurring at the moment, and which
will raise the earth within the hierarchy of worlds.33
        10. But why didn’t Christ speak of purgatory? It was because
the idea did not exist at the time, and therefore there was no
particular word to represent it. Christ used the word hell – the
only one used at the time – as a generic term to denote future
punishments indiscriminately. If beside the word “hell” he had
placed a word equivalent to “purgatory”, he would not have been
able to define its true meaning without opening up an issue reserved
for the future. He would also have had to affirm the existence of
two special places of punishment. Hell, in its normal meaning,
revealing the idea of punishment, implicitly entails a purgatory,
which is nothing more than a mode of punishment. The future
will enlighten humankind concerning the nature of punishment,
and will consequently reduce hell to its appropriate value.
        If the Church found it its duty after six centuries to supplement
Jesus’ silence on the matter by decreeing the existence of purgatory,
it is because it thought he had not said everything there was to say –
but why couldn’t that be true of other points as well?

              The Origin of the Doctrine
                of Eternal Punishment
        1. The belief in eternal punishment loses ground each and
every day, and one does not have to be a prophet to see that its end
is close at hand. It has been fought against with such powerful and
peremptory arguments that it would seem almost superfluous to
concern ourselves with such a doctrine from now on, and it might
be enough simply to let it die out by itself. However, we cannot
contest the fact that no matter how obsolete it is becoming, it is still
the rallying point for those who oppose new ideas, a point which
they defend with all the more obstinacy because it is one of the most
vulnerable, and also because they can foresee the consequences of its
fall. In light of this, the issue deserves a serious examination.

                                  73

                        Part One - Chapter VI


       2. The doctrine of eternal punishment had its reasons for
being – as did the physical idea of hell – as long as fear acted as
a restraint for souls who were little-advanced both intellectually
and morally. Since they would not have been greatly impressed
with the threat of spiritual punishment, neither would they have
been impressed with mere temporary punishment. They would
not have comprehended the justice of gradated and proportioned
punishment because they would not have been capable of grasping
the often-subtle nuances of good and evil, or the relative value of
attenuating or aggravating circumstances.
       3. The closer human beings are to the primitive state, the
more materially-oriented they are. Moral sense is slow to develop in
them, which is why they can only have a very imperfect idea about
God and the divine attributes, and an equally vague idea of the
future life. Likening God to their own nature, God is no more for
them than an absolute dictator who is both terrible and invisible,
like a despotic king who shuts himself up in his palace and never
shows himself to his subjects. Since they cannot comprehend God’s
moral power, they only accept God as embodying physical power.
They can only perceive of God as being armed with a lightening
bolt, or as being in the midst of lightning flashes and storms,
sowing destruction and ruin like invincible warriors do. A merciful
and wise God would not be God at all, but rather a weak being
without any means of forcing obedience. Implacable vengeance
and eternal, terrifying punishments are not incompatible with
their idea of God, nor repugnant to their reason. After all, humans
themselves are also implacable in their cruel revenge on their
enemies and are merciless toward the vanquished; hence, God,
who is superior to them, must be even more terrible than they are.
       In the past, such people needed religious beliefs in keeping
with their unrefined nature. A completely spiritual religion, full
of love and charity, could not be squared with the brutality of


                                 74

                  The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


their customs and passions. Thus, we cannot criticize Moses for
his draconian legislation – barely sufficient to restrain an unruly
people – or for having made God out to be a vindictive being. It
was necessary at the time. The gentle doctrine of Jesus would not
have hit a chord with them and would have proven to be powerless.
       4. As the spirit develops, however, the material veil is
dissipated little by little, and people become abler to comprehend
spiritual matters. But this only occurs gradually. When Jesus came,
he was able to proclaim a merciful God, to speak of the kingdom
of God, which is not of this world, and say to humankind: “Love
one another and do good to those who hate you,” whereas the ancients
had said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.”
       What kind of people lived at the time of Jesus? Were they
newly created and newly incarnated souls? If they were, wouldn’t that
mean that God had therefore created souls who were more advanced
than the ones he had created at the time of Moses? But what would
have happened to the latter? Were they destined to remain asleep
in their primitive state throughout all eternity? The most ordinary
commonsense rejects that notion. No, the souls of Jesus’ time were the
same ones that had lived under the dominion of the Mosaic law, and
who over many lifetimes had developed sufficiently to understand a
more elevated doctrine, just as today they are even more evolved and
capable of receiving an even more complete teaching.
       5. Consequently, Christ could not have revealed to his
contemporaries all the mysteries of the future. He himself said,
“I would have many other things to tell you if you were capable of
comprehending them, and that is why I speak to you in parables.”
Especially regarding morality, that is, human duty, Christ was very
explicit, because in touching upon the tangible nature of material
life he knew how to make himself understood. As for other issues,
however, he limited himself to using allegory to sow the seeds that
would have to develop later on.


                                 75

                          Part One - Chapter VI


        The doctrine of future punishment and reward belongs
to this latter order of ideas. In particular, the idea regarding
punishment could not have abruptly broken with preconceived
notions. Jesus came to reveal new duties to humankind: charity
and love for one’s neighbor instead of hate and vengeance, and
selflessness instead of selfishness. That was quite enough. He could
not logically mitigate the fear of punishment reserved for sinners
without at the same time mitigating the principle of duty. If he
promised the kingdom of heaven to the righteous, it was therefore
closed to the unrighteous. But where were they to go? A counterpart
was required capable of impressing highly materialistic minds so
that they could understand the spirit life. We must not forget that
Jesus was addressing common folk who were the least enlightened
segment of society, and who had to be confronted with somewhat
palpable images rather than subtle ideas. That is why Jesus did not
go into minute detail in this respect. At that time, it was enough
for him to set punishment in opposition to reward.
        6. If Jesus threatened the guilty with eternal fire, he also
threatened that they would be cast into Gahenna. But what was
Gahenna? It was nothing more than a city trash dump outside
Jerusalem. Should this also be interpreted literally? No, it was one of
those powerful images that he used to impress the masses. The same
applies regarding eternal fire; if not, he would have been contradicting
himself by exalting the clemency and mercy of God, because clemency
and inexorability are opposite sentiments that annul each other. Thus,
it would be a misunderstanding of the meaning of Jesus’ words by
attributing to them the sanction of the dogma of eternal punishment,
for his entire teaching proclaimed the compassion of the Creator.
        In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus teaches us to say, “Lord, forgive us
our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us,” so if
the guilty had no hope of forgiveness, it would be futile to ask for
it. Is this forgiveness unconditional, however? Is it grace perceived


                                   76

                   The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


as a pure and simple remission of the punishment that has been
incurred? No. The degree of forgiveness depends on the way in
which we ourselves forgive, which means that if we do not forgive,
we will not be forgiven. In making the forgiveness of offenses an
absolute condition, God could not require fragile humans to do
what Almighty God would not do. The Lord’s Prayer is a daily
negation of the idea of the eternal vengeance of God.
        7. For people who had only a confused notion about the
spirituality of the soul, the idea of physical fire was not so shocking,
since it could also be found in the popular belief coming from the
pagan idea of hell that was almost universally propagated. In the
same way, eternal punishment had nothing about it that would be
repugnant to a people who had for many centuries been ruled by
the laws of a terrifying Yahweh. In Jesus’ way of thinking, eternal
fire could have therefore been nothing more than a simple image,
but it would not have mattered much to him if it were interpreted
literally. It would serve as a restraint. He knew very well that time
and progress would eventually take care of the allegorical meaning,
especially when, according to his prediction, the Spirit of Truth
would come to enlighten humankind about all things.
        The essential character of unforgivable punishment is
the inefficacy of repentance, but Jesus never said that repentance
would not warrant the Father’s grace. On the contrary, on every
occasion he proclaimed a kind and merciful God who was ready
to receive the prodigal son as soon as he returned to the paternal
home. Jesus only revealed an unbending God to the stubborn
sinner; nevertheless, if God had punishment in one hand, in the
other God always held forgiveness and was ready to grant it to any
guilty individual who sincerely repented. This is certainly not the
portrayal of an unmerciful God. We must also point out the fact
that Jesus never pronounced unforgivable condemnation against
anyone, even against those who were guiltiest.

                          Part One - Chapter VI


       8. In keeping with the character of the various peoples, all
primitive religions had warrior gods who fought at the head of their
armies. The Hebrews’ Yahweh provided his armies with a thousand ways
to exterminate their enemies, and he rewarded them with victory or
punished them with defeat. According to their idea of God, the ancients
believed they could honor or appease God with the blood of animals or
humans, which gave rise to the bloody sacrifices that represented such
a salient role in all the religions of antiquity. The Jews had abolished
human sacrifices, but in spite of Christ’s teachings, Christians for a long
time deemed it honorable to the Creator to deliver thousands of those
whom they labeled as heretics to torture and the stake. This comprised
another real form of human sacrifice, since they did it to the greater
glory of God and accompanied it with religious ceremony. Even today,
the God of Hosts is invoked before battle and glorified after victory – so
many times for unjust and anti-Christian causes.
       9. Humankind has taken so long to rid itself of its habits,
prejudices and primitive ideas! Forty centuries separate us from
Moses, and our Christian generation still sees traces of ancient,
barbaric usages that are consecrated or at least approved of by
today’s religion! The unwavering assertions of the unorthodox –
those who were regarded as heretics – were necessary to end
the burnings at the stake and to bring about an understanding
of the true nature of God. However, even though there are no
more burnings, material and mental persecutions still prevail –
so entrenched is the human idea of divine cruelty. Nourished by
sentiments that have been ingrained since infancy, should people
marvel that the God to whom they have been introduced and
whom they have honored with barbarous acts condemns the guilty
to suffer eternally and mercilessly watches them while they suffer?
       Yes, the philosophers and the so-called impious are the ones
who have been offended at seeing the name of God profaned by acts
unworthy of deity. These are the individuals who have shown others


                                    78

                  The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


the fullness of God’s grandeur, ridding the divine of the passions
and pettiness attributed to it by a less-enlightened belief system. On
this point, religion has gained in dignity what it has lost in outward
prestige, because if there are now fewer people devoted to form, there
are more who are sincerely religious through sentiment and the heart.
       However, alongside these, how many have been unreflectingly
led to deny Providence altogether! The way in which religion has
stood still by being antagonistic toward the progress of human
reason and without knowing how to reconcile it with religious
beliefs has led some to degenerate into deism, and others into
outright disbelief – not to mention pantheism. In other words,
people have turned themselves into their own god in the absence of
a more perfect one.

 Arguments in Favor of Eternal Punishment
       10. Let us return to the dogma of eternal punishment. Here
is the main argument invoked in its favor: People believe that the
seriousness of the offense is in proportion to the quality of the
offense, that is, an offense committed against a sovereign would be
regarded as more serious than one against a common individual,
and for that reason would be more severely punished. And since
God is much more than a sovereign, because God is infinite, then
any offense against God also becomes infinite, and therefore merits
a punishment of the same nature, i.e. eternal.
       Rebuttal: Any rebuttal is a reasoning process that must have
its departure point, a basis upon which it is supported – premises,
in other words. We find these premises in the actual attributes of
God: God is unique, eternal, unchangeable, immaterial, omnipotent,
supremely just and good, infinite in all perfections.
       It is impossible to conceive of God in any other way, since
without infinite perfection, God would not be God, and that

                                 79

                        Part One - Chapter VI


would mean that we could conceive of some other being with
qualities that God might not possess. In order for God to be above
all other beings, it is necessary that no other being exceed or even
equal God in any way. Thus, God must be wholly infinite.
       Since they are infinite, the divine attributes can neither
increase nor decrease without ceasing to be infinite; otherwise,
they would not be infinite and God would not be perfect. If just
one of the divine attributes were decreased one tiny bit, God per se
would no longer exist, because it would then be possible for there
to be another being that was more perfect.
       The infiniteness of a quality excludes the possibility of the
existence of any other opposite quality which might diminish or
annul it. An infinitely good being could not be the least bit evil,
nor could an infinitely evil being be the least bit good; an object
could not be absolutely black if it contained the least shade of
white, and vice-versa.
       Now that this departure point has been established, let us
refute the above-stated argument.
       11. Only an infinite being could make something else that
is infinite. Since human beings are finite in virtue, knowledge,
power, aptitudes and earthly lifespan, they can only produce
limited things.
       If humans could be infinite in the evil they commit, they
could also be infinite in the good they do, and would therefore
be equal with God. However, if humans were infinitely good,
they would not commit evil, because absolute good completely
excludes all possibility of evil.
       If we were to believe that a temporary offense against the
Divinity could be infinite, and if God were to seek vengeance
through an infinite punishment, God would thus be infinitely
vengeful. And if God were infinitely vengeful, God could not be
infinitely good and merciful, since such divine attributes would


                                 80

                  The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


exclude each other. If God were not infinitely good, God would
not be perfect; therefore, God would cease to be God.
       If God is unforgiving toward a guilty person who repents,
God is not merciful; if God is not merciful, God ceases to be
infinitely good. But why would God give humankind a law of
forgiveness if God as God did not forgive? The result would be
that if humans were to forgive their enemies and return good for
evil, they would be better than God, who remains deaf to the
repentance of those who have offended God, denying them the
slightest attenuation of punishment forever.
       Being omnipresent and all-seeing, God must also see the
tortures of the condemned, and if God were to remain forever
insensitive to their wailings, God would be eternally merciless;
without mercy, God would not be infinitely good.
       12. Supporters of eternal punishment respond that the
sinner who repents before dying receives God’s mercy and that even
the guiltiest can receive such grace. We do not doubt this at all,
and we also understand that God only forgives those who repent,
while remaining unbending toward those who callously do not.
Nonetheless, if God is all-merciful toward the repentant soul before
death, then why not toward those who repent afterward? Why
would repentance be efficacious only during life – a brief instant –
and not during the eternity that has no end? If circumscribed to a
given time, the divine goodness and mercy would not be infinite,
and God would thus not be infinitely good.
       13. God is supremely just. Supreme justice is not absolutely
unforgiving, nor does it leave any wrong unpunished. On the
contrary, it considers both good and evil in the strictest manner,
and rewards the former and punishes the latter with perfect equity,
without ever being mistaken.
       If a soul can be punished forever without any hope of
clemency or forgiveness due to fleeting wrongs that always result


                                 81

                           Part One - Chapter VI


from humans’ imperfect nature and often from their environment,
then there is no symmetry between the wrong and its punishment;
therefore, there is no justice.
        If the guilty reconcile themselves to God, repenting and
asking to right an evil that has been committed, that in itself
is a return to the good and good sentiments. However, if
punishment were unforgivable, this return to the good would be
pointless, since God would not take the good into account and
therefore would not practice justice. In the world of humans, the
condemned who mend their ways have their sentence commuted
and often are even forgiven; thus, there would be more equity in
human justice than in divine justice.
        If a punishment were incommutable, it would be futile
to repent, and the guilty, with no hope of gaining anything by
righting themselves, may as well persist in evil; therefore, not only
would God condemn them to suffer forever, but they would also
remain evil forever. There is neither goodness nor justice in this.
        14. Since God is infinite in every way, God must encompass
both the past and the future. Upon creating a soul, God must
know if it will seriously fail and thus be eternally condemned.
If God does not know this, then the divine wisdom ceases to be
infinite and God ceases to be God. However, if God does know
and intentionally goes ahead to create a soul that is condemned
from its very creation to unending torment, God ceases to be good.
        If God, however, could confer grace upon a repentant sinner
and remove it from hell, then eternal punishment ceases to exist and
the human conception of it is refuted.
        15. To sum up, the doctrine of absolute eternal punishment leads
to the negation, or, at least, to the weakening of some of God’s attributes,
and is thus incompatible with absolute perfection. This leads one to the
following conclusion: if God is perfect, there is no eternal punishment;
if there is eternal punishment then God is not perfect.


                                    82

                  The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


        16. The following argument is also called upon to support
the dogma of eternal punishment:
        Since the reward conferred upon the righteous is eternal,
then its counterpart must be found in eternal punishment. It is
correct to draw a parallel between punishment and reward.
        Counterargument: Has God created souls to make them
happy or unhappy?
        Obviously, a creature’s happiness should be the aim of the
Creator, or God would not be good. Individuals attain happiness
through their own merit, and once such merit has been acquired,
it is never lost; otherwise, the soul could regress. Eternal happiness
is therefore the consequence of its immortality.
        However, before reaching perfection it has struggles to
bear and battles to win over its evil passions. Since it was not
created perfect but susceptible of being so in order for it to receive
the merit of its works then the soul may fail as a consequence of
its natural weakness. But if this weakness were to be punished
forever, one would have to ask why God did not create it
stronger in the first place. Punishment is before anything else
a warning as to an evil that has already been committed and
it serves the purpose of leading the soul back onto the moral
path. If punishment were irremissible, then the desire to improve
would be superfluous. Moreover, the goal of creation could
never be reached, because there would be beings that had been
predestined to either happiness or unhappiness. If a soul can
repent, it can be regenerated, and if it can be regenerated, it can
aspire to happiness. Would God be just in denying such means?
        Since the good is the supreme goal of creation, then
happiness, which is its reward, must be eternal, and punishment,
as the means of reaching it, must be temporary. The most ordinary
sense of human justice proscribes perpetually punishing someone
who shows a desire to practice the good.

                          Part One - Chapter VI


       17. A final argument in favor of eternal punishment is as follows:
       The fear of eternal punishment acts as a restraint. Doing
away with it and no longer having anything to fear would lead
people to plunge into all sorts of excess.
       Counterargument: This line of reasoning would be correct if
the non-eternality of punishment might lead to the suppression of
all divine penal sanctions.
       Happiness or unhappiness in the future life is the strict
consequence of God’s justice, whereas viewing it as parallel to the
situation of a moral person and an evil one would be a denial of
such justice. However, in spite of not being eternal, punishment
is no less distressing, for the greater the conviction, the greater the
fear. A punishment in which one does not believe is no restraint,
and this is the case of eternal punishment.
       As we have already affirmed, the belief in eternal punishment
had its usefulness and reason for being at one time; however, today
it not only has failed to frighten, but has even led to disbelief. Before
rendering this belief a necessity, it is necessary to demonstrate its
reality. Furthermore, we would have to observe its effectiveness
regarding those who accept it and whether or not they put forth
the effort to demonstrate it. Unfortunately, among them there are
many who show by their actions that they have no fear of eternal
punishment whatsoever. Thus, if the fear of eternal punishment is
powerless to repress evil among those who profess to believe in it,
what hold could it possibly have over those who do not?

              The Physical Impossibility
               of Eternal Punishment
      18. Up to this point, we have only fought the dogma of
eternal punishment by using reasoning. We shall now show how it


                                   84

                   The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


is contrary to the hard facts that we have observed and that have
proven its impossibility.
       According to this dogma, the fate of the soul after death is
irrevocably set, and the soul is thus definitively barred from any
further progress. Well, does the soul progress or not? That is the
question. If it progresses, eternal punishment is impossible.
       Can this progress be doubted, given the enormous variety of
moral and intellectual aptitudes represented on the earth from the
primitive to the civilized individual, and confirmed by the differences
that one particular culture may display from one century to the
next? If we were to believe that they are not the same souls who
have reincarnated, we would have to believe that God creates souls
of all degrees of development according to time and place, favoring
some while relegating others to perpetual inferiority. This would be
incompatible with justice, which must be the same for all creatures.
       19. It is undeniable that a morally and intellectually less
evolved soul, such as that of barbaric peoples, cannot contain the
same elements of happiness and the same aptitudes for enjoying
the splendors of the infinite as the soul whose faculties are broadly
developed. Therefore, if these souls could not progress, they could
enjoy only a highly reduced happiness, even under the most favorable
circumstances. In order to be in harmony with strict justice, we must
thus draw the conclusion that more highly advanced souls were less
evolved souls at an earlier time, but who progressed later. However,
here we arrive at the big question of the plurality of existences as the
only and rational means of resolving the problem. Nonetheless, let
us disregard this issue for the time being and consider the soul from
the point of view that it only lives a single existence.
       20. Let us take as an example a young man about 20 years
old, who, like so many others at his age, is uneducated, possessed
of base instincts and skeptical (he denies both God and the soul); a
troublemaker engaged in all kinds of perversity. Later on, this young


                                  85

                          Part One - Chapter VI


man finds himself in a more favorable environment. He works,
receives an education, gradually rights himself and finally becomes
a pious individual. Isn’t this a tangible example of the soul’s progress
during life, something we see happening every day? Now this man
dies as a saint at an old age and naturally his salvation is ensured.
However, what would have been his fate if an accident had put an
end to his life forty or fifty years too soon? He would have found
himself in all the right conditions to be damned, and once damned,
all progress would have stopped. We therefore see a man who was
saved only because he lived long enough, someone who, according
to the doctrine of eternal punishment, would have been lost forever
if he had lived less time as a result of a fortuitous accident. If his soul
could progress during that given amount of time, then why couldn’t
it progress further after death if an outside cause had prevented it
from doing so during earthly life? Why would God refuse it the
means of repentance? Repentance, albeit late, would have come in
due time, but if at the moment of death the soul became irrevocably
condemned, its repentance would be fruitless for all eternity and its
aptitude for progress destroyed forever.
       21. The dogma of absolute, eternal punishment is therefore
incompatible with the progress of the soul, since it is confronted
with an unsurpassable barrier. These two principles obviously
cancel each other out – if one is true, the other cannot be. But
which one is, in fact, true? The law of progress is obvious. It is
not a theory; it is a fact corroborated by experience. It is a divine,
non-proscribable law of nature. It is thus a law that cannot be
reconciled with the other, which is why the other is untrue. If the
dogma of eternal punishment were actually true, St. Augustine, St.
Paul and so many others would never have seen heaven if they had
died before completing the progress that led to their conversion.
       This last assertion will no doubt lead to the response that
the conversion of these saintly personages was not the result of


                                    86

                            The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


their soul’s progress, but rather the grace that was granted them
and by which they were touched.
       However, this is simply a game of words. If those saints
practiced evil and then the good, it is because they became better,
and they therefore progressed. Did God grant them a special favor,
the divine grace to right themselves? Why favor them more than
others? It always comes back to the doctrine of special privilege,
which is incompatible with the justice of God and the divine love
that is the same for all creatures.
       According to the Spiritist Doctrine – according to the very
words of the Gospel – and according to logic and strictest justice,
human beings are the children of their own deeds both during life
and after death – nothing is owed to favoritism. God rewards them
for their efforts and punishes them for their negligence for as long
as they persist in it.

                    The Doctrine of Eternal
                  Punishment Has Had Its Day
       22. The belief in eternal punishment was maintained as a
healthy restraint until humankind was at a point to understand its
moral aptitude. The same applies to children, whom one restrains
for awhile with threats of fanciful beings to frighten them. However,
the time will come when they reach the age of reason and reject
such chimeras by themselves, and it will then be absurd to think
they can be controlled by such means. If those who guide them try
to continue suggesting to them that such fables are in fact true, they
will lose their trust. This is the case with humankind, who has left its
infancy and its leading-strings.34 People are no longer those passive

instruments bowed under material powers, nor are they gullible
creatures who accept everything with “eyes wide shut”.
        23. Belief is an act of understanding, and as such cannot
be imposed. If during a certain period of humankind the dogma
of eternal punishment might have been inoffensive and even
beneficial, the time has come in which it has become dangerous. In
fact, if it is imposed as absolute truth while reason rejects it, one of
two things will necessarily result: people who want to believe in and
seek a more rational faith will either avoid those who continue to
profess it, or they will completely disbelieve everything altogether.
Whoever might want to study the matter rationally will see that in
our day the dogma of eternal punishment has made more atheists
and materialists than all other philosophies combined.
        Ideas follow an incessantly progressive course, and one cannot
govern people without following it. Intending to remain stationary
on it, to regress, or simply to lag behind while it advances is to lose
oneself. Following or not following this evolutionary course is a
matter of life and death for religions as well as for governments.
Is this good? Is it bad? It is certainly bad for those who, living in
the past, see that past disappear from under them; however, for
those who look to the future, it is the law of progress – a law of
God. And against God’s laws all resistance is futile. To fight against
God’s will is to ask for defeat.
        Then why use every effort to uphold a belief that has fallen
into decrepitude, and which actually produces more harm than
good to religion itself? Ah! Sad to say, but a material issue controls
the religious issue here. The belief in eternal punishment has been
largely exploited by the idea that the doors of heaven can be opened
with money, and that one can save oneself from hell thereby. The
amount garnered in this manner, both yesterday and today, is
incalculable; it is the tax paid on the fear of eternity. Since this fee
is optional, the profit is always in proportion to the belief, and if


                                  88

                  The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment


the belief no longer exists, collections would disappear. Children
will willingly give up their piece of cake to whomever promises
to chase away the werewolf, but when they no longer believe in
werewolves, they will keep the cake.
       24. The New Revelation provides more sensible notions
about the future life and shows that each one of us can promote
our own happiness through our own efforts. Consequently, this
Revelation must encounter tremendous opposition because it
puts a stop to one of the most lucrative sources of income. Such
has always been the case when a new discovery or invention
abolishes custom. Whoever makes their living according to old
and lingering processes will never cease to defend them and
will discredit all new and more economical ones. For example,
despite the benefits it has brought to society, do you think the
printing press was praised by copyists when it was introduced?
No, they obviously must have cursed it. The same has applied
regarding various other machines, the railroad and hundreds of
other discoveries and applications.
       In the eyes of disbelievers, the dogma of eternal punishment
is a simple foolishness that they laugh at. To philosophers, the
dogma has a social gravity because of the abuses it engenders,
while truly religious persons have the dignity of a religion that is
interested in destroying the abuses this dogma gives rise to.

       Ezekiel against Eternal Punishment
                and Original Sin
      25. Those who intend to find justification for eternal
punishment in the Bible can be refuted with unambiguous texts
to the contrary. The following words from Ezekiel are the most
explicit negation not only of irremissible punishment, but also


                                 89

of the notion that the responsibility of the sin committed by the
father of humankind35 could be passed down to the human race:
        1
          The Lord spoke to me again, saying, 2 “Where does this parable
come from, which you use amongst yourselves and which is proverbially
affirmed in Israel: ‘Fathers’, you say, ‘have eaten sour grapes and their
children’s teeth are set on edge?’” 3 “As I live,” says the Lord God, “this
parable shall no longer be used amongst you as a proverb in Israel. 4
For all souls belong to me; the child’s soul is with me as well as the
father’s; the soul that has sinned shall die.”
        5
           “If a man is righteous and acts according to equity and
justice;”... 7 “if he does not sadden or afflict anyone; if he returns to
his debtor the guarantee that he has made; if he takes nothing from
the assets of another by violence; if he gives his bread to whomever is
hungry; if he clothes those who are naked; 8 if he is not usurious or does
not receive back more than what he has given; if he avoids iniquity
and promotes a conciliatory judgment between two who are in conflict;

  if he walks according to my precepts and observes my statutes to work
in harmony with the truth, then such a man is righteous and will
certainly live long,” says the Lord God.

but shall certainly live. 18 His father, who had oppressed others because
of his calumnies, and who had committed criminal acts in the midst
of his people, died on account of his own iniquity.”

        Future Punishment
       according to Spiritism
The Flesh Is Weak • Sources of the Spiritist Doctrine concerning
   Future Punishment • The Penal Code of the Future Life



                     The Flesh Is Weak
        There are certain depraved inclinations that are obviously
inherent to the spirit because they are more related to the moral than
to the physical, whereas others seem more the result of the physical
organism, and for that reason those who possess them are deemed
less responsible. These are inclinations to anger, laziness, lust, etc.
        Nowadays, spiritualist philosophers fully realize that the
areas of the brain corresponding to the various aptitudes owe their
development to the activity of the spirit, and, consequently, that
this development is an effect rather than a cause. Individuals are
not musicians because they have the gift of music; they have the
gift of music because their spirits are already musicians.
        If the activity of the spirit acts upon the brain, it must also
act upon the other physical parts of the organism. In this way, the
spirit is the artisan of the body, which is molded by it, so to speak,
in the fashion of the spirit’s needs and the manifestation of its


                                  93

                         Part One - Chapter VII


tendencies. Thus, the corporeal perfection of certain individuals
is not the product of a distinct creation but rather is the result of
the efforts of the spirit, who perfects its physical envelope as its
faculties increase.
       As a natural consequence of this principle, the spirit’s moral
dispositions should modify the qualities of the blood, making it more
active or less so, thereby causing more abundant or less abundant
secretions of bile and other fluids. That is why a glutton’s mouth
waters before an appetizing dish, for example. It is obviously not the
food per se that excites the taste organs, since it doesn’t even come
in contact with them. It is the spirit, whose sensitivity is awakened,
and who acts upon the organ through thought. For another person
such a sight would produce no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, it
is for the same reason that a sensitive person sheds tears easily. It
is not an abundance of tears that makes the spirit sensitive, but
rather the spirit’s sensitiveness that elicits an abundant flow of tears.
Under the influence of sensitiveness, the organism conditions itself
to the normal disposition of this sort of spirit in the same way that it
conditions itself to the disposition of the gluttonous spirit.
       According to this line of thought, one can understand that a
hot-tempered spirit is behind a bilious temperament, which does
not mean that the person is hot-tempered from being bilious, but is
bilious because his or her spirit is hot-tempered. The same applies
regarding all the other instinctive dispositions: an indolent and
weak spirit will put the body in a state of weakness with respect
to its character, whereas an active and energetic spirit will give the
blood and nerves qualities that are exactly the opposite. The spirit’s
action upon the physical body is so obvious that we often see grave
organic disorders produced by violent mental disturbances.
       The common expression, “Emotion makes the blood boil”
is not as devoid of meaning as one might suppose. What could
make the blood boil if not the mental dispositions of the spirit?


                                   94

                Future Punishment according to Spiritism


        Consequently, one must admit – at least partially – that
the temperament is determined by the spirit’s nature, which
is the cause and not the effect. We say “partially” because there
are cases in which the physical obviously influences the mental,
such as when a morbid or abnormal state is determined by an
external and accidental cause independent of the spirit, such as
temperature, climate, congenital physical defects, temporary
illness, etc. The spirit’s mental state in such cases may be affected
in its manifestation by a pathological state without its intrinsic
nature being modified. Blaming its errors on the weakness of the
flesh is no more than an excuse to escape responsibility. The flesh
is only weak because the spirit is weak. This reverses the issue and
leaves the spirit fully responsible for all its acts. Since the flesh is
devoid of both thought and will, it could never prevail over the
spirit, who is a thinking being possessed of its own will. The spirit is
what gives the flesh the qualities corresponding to its instincts, just
like the artist who impresses a material work with the stamp of his
or her spirit. When freed from its animal-like instincts, it develops
a body that is no longer a tyrant over its spiritual aspirations, and
that is when men and women begin eating to live and stop living
to eat, so to speak.
        Moral responsibility for the acts of life therefore becomes
intact, but reason tells us that the consequences of the spirit’s
responsibility must be in proportion to its intellectual development.
Thus, the more enlightened it is, the more blameworthy it becomes,
since with intelligence and moral sense are born the notions of
good and evil, of righteousness and unrighteousness.
        This law explains why medicine is ineffective in certain
cases. Since the temperament is an effect and not a cause, every
effort to alter it is ineffective in light of the mental dispositions of
the spirit, who puts up an unconscious resistance that neutralizes
the therapeutic action. Consequently, it is the primary cause that


                                  95

                                    Part One - Chapter VII


must be acted upon. Thus, if you can, offer courage to the coward,
and you will soon see the physiological effects of fear subside. This
proves once more the need to take the spiritual influence on the
organism into account in the art of healing. (See La Revue Spirite,
Mar. 1869, p. 65)

               Sources of the Spiritist Doctrine
                regarding Future Punishment
        Regarding future punishment, the Spiritist Doctrine is not
based on some preconceived theory – it is not a matter of one
theory replacing another. In everything, it is based on observation,
and that is what gives it its full authority. No one ever imagined
that souls after death might be found in this or that condition,
but it is these very souls – who have departed the earth – who
have come to initiate us into the mysteries of the future life. They
themselves describe their happy or misfortunate situations, their
impressions, their transformation after the death of their body; in
other words, they complete Christ’s teachings on the matter.
        However, we are not just dealing with the revelations of only
one spirit, who might see things from its own point of view and from
only one perspective, or who might still be dominated by earthly
prejudices; nor are we dealing with a revelation made exclusively to
one particular individual who might be led by appearances or by an
ecstatic vision that is susceptible to delusion and often is no more than
the reflection of an over-active imagination.36 Instead, we are dealing
with countless examples furnished by spirits of all categories – from
the most high-ordered down to the least on the scale – through
many intermediaries (mediums) scattered throughout the earth,
so that the revelation would not be any one individual’s special

privilege. Anyone may test and observe it without having to believe
in it based upon the faith of someone else.

        The Penal Code of the Future Life
        Therefore, Spiritism has not come on its own authority to
formulate a code of fantasy; its laws regarding the future of the soul
have been deduced from studying the facts and can be summed up
in the following points:
        1) In the spirit life, the soul or spirit suffers the consequences
of all the imperfections that it could not correct during its corporeal
life. Its happy or unhappy state is inherent to its degree of purity
or impurity.
        2) Complete happiness is inherent to perfection, that is, the
complete purification of the spirit. Every imperfection is at the
same time a cause of suffering and the privation of blessedness,
just as every acquired quality is a source of blessedness and the
attenuation of suffering.
        3) There is not one single imperfection of the soul that does
not carry disagreeable and inevitable consequences, just as there is
not one single good quality that is not a source of joy. The amount
of punishment is therefore proportional to the amount of
imperfection, just as joy is proportional to the soul’s good qualities.
        A soul that has ten imperfections, for example, suffers more
than one with only three or four, and when these ten imperfections
are reduced by a quarter or a half, it will suffer less. When all its
imperfections are gone, the soul will then be perfectly happy, just
as on earth, those who have many maladies suffer more than those
who have none or only one. For the same reason, the soul who has
ten good qualities has more joy than another who has fewer.
        4) Due to the law of progress that endows every soul with
the potential to acquire the good it yet lacks and to free itself from

                                   97

                         Part One - Chapter VII


the evil it yet possesses, according to its own efforts and will, then
the future is wide open to all individuals. God does not repudiate
any of God’s children – they are received into the divine heart to
the degree they approach perfection; thus, all are left to the merit
of their own works.
       5) Since suffering depends on the amount of imperfection,
and joy on the amount of perfection, the soul bears within itself its
own punishment wherever it may be without having to be in some
circumscribed place. Hell is wherever there are suffering souls, and
heaven is wherever there are joyous souls.
       6) The good and evil we do result from the qualities we
possess. Not doing good whenever we can is therefore the result
of some imperfection. If every imperfection is the source of some
kind of suffering, the spirit must suffer not only for the evil it has
done but also for the good that it has failed to do.
       7) The spirit suffers for the evil it has done in such a way
that with its attention constantly directed toward the consequences
of such evil, it better understands its problems and is thus led to
correct itself.
       8) Since God’s justice is infinite, good and evil are strictly
taken into account. If there is not one evil act, one evil thought
that does not bring fatal consequences, neither is there one single
meritorious act, one good movement of the soul or the smallest
merit that will be lost – even for the most perverse individuals,
because it indicates that progress has begun.
       9) Every wrong committed, every evil act entails a debt that
must be paid, if not in one existence, then in the next or other future
ones, for all existences are in solidarity with one another. A debt that
is paid in one existence will not have to be paid a second time.
       10) The spirit suffers, whether in the corporeal world or in
the spirit world, as a consequence of its imperfections. The misery,
the vicissitudes endured in corporeal existence originate from


                                  98

                        Future Punishment according to Spiritism


imperfections and are expiations of wrongs committed both in the
present and in previous lives.
        By the nature of the sufferings and vicissitudes one endures
in the corporeal life, one can deduce the nature of the wrongs
committed in a previous existence and the imperfections that
caused them.
        11) Expiation varies according to the nature and seriousness
of the wrong; hence, one and the same wrong can result in
several expiations, depending on the attenuating or aggravating
circumstances in which is was committed.
        12) There is no absolute or uniform rule as to the nature
and duration of the punishment. The only general law is that every
wrong will be punished and every meritorious act will be rewarded
according to its worth.
        13) The duration of the punishment depends on how much
the guilty spirit improves itself. No condemnation for a set amount
of time is declared against it. What God requires for the end of
suffering is a serious, effective improvement and an authentic
return to the good.
        In this way, the spirit is always the arbiter of its own fate
and can prolong its suffering through persistence in evil, or it can
soften and shorten it through its efforts in practicing the good.
        Condemnation for a set time would have the double
inappropriateness of continuing the punishment of the repentant
spirit or of freeing it from suffering while it still persists in evil.
And God, who is just, only punishes evil while it still exists and
ceases to punish it when it no longer exists.37 Likewise, since moral
evil is in and of itself a cause of suffering, suffering will last as long
as the evil remains, or it will decrease in intensity as the evil lessens.
        14) The duration of the punishment being subordinate
to improvement, it would follow that a guilty spirit who never
37
     See chap VI, no. 25, quote from Ezekiel – Auth.



                                               99

                                   Part One - Chapter VII


improved itself would suffer forever, and the punishment for such
a spirit would be eternal.
        15) A condition inherent to less evolved spirits is that they
cannot see the end of their situation, and they thus believe they will
suffer forever. This is what makes punishment seem eternal to them.38
        16) Even though repentance is the first step toward
regeneration, it is not enough by itself; expiation and reparation
are still required.
        Repentance, expiation and reparation therefore comprise the
three necessary conditions for erasing the remnants of a wrong
and its consequences. Repentance softens the rigors of expiation
because it awakens hope and prepares the way for rehabilitation.
Only reparation, however, can annul the effect and thereby destroy
the cause; otherwise, forgiveness would be an act of grace alone and
not an annulment of the wrong.
        17) Repentance can occur at any time and in any place, but
if later, the guilty spirit suffers longer.
        Until the last vestiges of a wrong have disappeared,
expiation consists in the physical and mental sufferings that are
its consequences, whether in the current lifetime, whether in the
spirit life after death, or in a later corporeal existence.
        Reparation consists in righting a wrong that has been
done to somebody. Those who do not repair their wrongs in one
existence either out of weakness or ill will, will find themselves
in a later existence being placed in contact with the same persons
who had had a complaint against them previously, and in
conditions voluntarily chosen beforehand. This occurs in such
a way as to give them the opportunity to prove their sincerity to
38
     Perpetual is synonymous with eternal. We say ‘the perpetual snows’, ‘the eternal ice of the
     poles’, and we also say ‘the perpetual secretary of the Academy’, which does not mean that
     these things should be regarded as truly eternal but only as being of an undetermined
     length of time. Eternal and perpetual are used in the sense of undetermined. In this sense,
     one may say that sufferings are eternal if one understands them to be of unlimited duration.
     Thus, for the spirit, its sufferings seem eternal because it cannot see their end – Auth.

those whom they had offended by doing as much good to them
as they had done evil.
       Not all wrongs result in direct and immediate harm.
In such cases, reparation occurs in their doing what they had
failed to do, fulfilling duties they had neglected or ignored,
or accomplishing missions at which they had failed; in other
words, practicing the good in compensation for former evil:
becoming humble if they had been proud, caring if they had
been austere, charitable if they had been selfish, benevolent if
they had been perverse, industrious if they had been lazy, useful
if they had been useless, sensible if they had been self-indulgent,
demonstrative of a good example if they had been a bad one, an
so on and so forth. This is how the spirit progresses by taking
advantage of its past.39
       18) Imperfect spirits are banned from happy worlds, whose
harmony they would upset. They remain on less evolved worlds
where they expiate their wrongs through the tribulations of life
and purify themselves of their imperfections until they deserve to
incarnate on more physically and morally evolved worlds.
       If we could conceive of a circumscribed place of punishment,
it would be precisely on these worlds of expiation, because it is
around such worlds that imperfect discarnate spirits throng,
39
     The requirement for reparation is a principle of strict justice, which can be regarded as a
     true law for a spirit’s moral rehabilitation. It is a doctrine that no religion has yet proclaimed.
     Some persons reject it because they think it would be more convenient for them to be
     able to erase their wrongs simply by the kind of repentance that involves only a few words
     and the help of certain formulas. However, even though they might be convinced that
     they are thus freed, they will find out later that it was not sufficient. We might ask them if
     this principle is not affirmed by human law, and if God’s justice could be inferior to that of
     humans, or if they themselves would be satisfied when some individual who had harmed
     them by abusing their trust limited him or herself to merely apologizing. So, why would
     they feel excused before an obligation that every honest individual should fulfill to the
     best of his or her ability?
     When this perspective on reparation is finally engrained in the belief of the masses, it
     will act as a more powerful brake than hell and eternal punishment, because it will apply
     to their current lifetime and will enable them to understand the reasons behind the
     troublesome circumstances of their current situation – Auth.



                                                  101

                        Part One - Chapter VII


waiting for a new existence that will enable them to repair the evils
they have done, which in turn will enable them to progress.
       19) Since a spirit always has its free will, it sometimes
progresses quite slowly and its obstinacy in evil can be quite
tenacious. This state can persist for years and even centuries, but
the time will finally come in which its stubbornness in defying
God’s justice abates as a result of its suffering, and despite its
boasting it recognizes the superior power that dominates it. At
that moment, the first light of repentance dawns and God enables
it to catch a glimpse of hope.
       No spirit is conditioned to never bettering itself; otherwise,
it would be fatalistically destined to remain eternally of a low order
and it would escape the law of progress that providentially governs
all creatures.
       20) No matter how little-evolved and perverse spirits may
be, God never abandons them. Everybody has their guardian angel
watching out for them, supervising the expansion of their soul,
making every effort to awaken good thoughts and the desire to
evolve, and encouraging them to repair in a new existence the evil
they had done in a previous one. However, guardian angels act
almost always in a concealed way, without exerting any pressure.
A spirit must progress by the impulse of its own will – never by any
coercion. Good and evil are practiced in virtue of the spirit’s free
will, without being fatalistically pushed in one direction or the
other. If the spirit persists in evil, it will suffer the consequences
for as long as it does so, but if it takes one step toward the good, it
will immediately feel the beneficial effects.
       It would be erroneous to believe that because of the law of
progress the certainty of sooner or later attaining to perfection
and happiness could stimulate persistence in evil with a view to
repenting later on; first, because a little-evolved spirit cannot
ascertain the end of its situation; second, because, since it is the


                                 102

                Future Punishment according to Spiritism


author of its own unhappiness, it finally winds up understanding
that it depends on itself alone to end it; third, that the longer it
persist in evil, the longer it will be unhappy, because it knows that
its suffering will be perpetual if it itself does not put an end to it.
Thus, it would be making a calculated error, and it would be the
first to be deceived. With the dogma of eternal punishment, on
the other hand, all hope would be futile; the spirit would have no
interest in turning toward the good because there would be no
advantage to it.
        The objection regarding God’s foreknowledge also falls
before this law, because having created a soul, God of course
knows that due to its free will it will turn towards the good or evil
path. God knows that it will be punished for doing evil; however,
God also knows that temporary punishment is a way to enable it
to understand its error and sooner or later enter onto the moral
path. According to the doctrine of eternal punishment, one must
conclude that God knows that such a soul will fail and, therefore,
that it is condemned beforehand to unending torture.
        21) Responsibility for wrongs is completely personal. No
one suffers for the wrongs of someone else, except for having
caused them in the first place, whether by provoking them through
example or by not preventing them when they could have done so.
        Consequently, suicide will always be punished, but whoever
drives someone by his or her harshness to despair and to commit
it will suffer an even greater punishment.
        22) Although the diversity of punishments is infinite, there
are some that are inherent to how little-evolved the spirit may be;
the consequences for these, except for a few details, are more or
less identical.
        The most common punishment among those who are
especially attached to the materialistic life and who neglect spiritual
progress consists in the slowness with which the separation of the soul


                                  103

                        Part One - Chapter VII


and body occurs at death, along with the anguish that accompanies
it and their awakening to another life, and to the resultant state
of confusion that can last for months and even years. On the
other hand, for those who have maintained a pure conscience,
have identified with the spirit life and have freed themselves from
materialism during their corporeal life, the transition is quick and
without difficulty; the awakening is pleasant and there is hardly any
confusion at all.
       23) A very common phenomenon among spirits who have
not evolved morally to a certain degree is that they believe they
are still alive, and this delusion can last for many years, during
which they experience all the needs, torments and perplexities of
physical life.
       24) For criminals, the incessant presence of their victims
and the circumstances of their crimes are a cruel torment.
       25) Some spirits are immersed in thick darkness. Others
find themselves in complete isolation in space, tormented by their
ignorance of the situation as well as the fate that awaits them. The
guiltiest suffer tortures that are all the more pungent because they
can see no end to them. Some are kept from seeing their loved
ones, and all generally endure sufferings whose intensity is relative
to the evils they practiced and the pain and necessities they caused
others to suffer, until repentance and the desire for reparation bring
them enough tranquility to foresee the possibility of putting an
end to their situation through their own efforts.
       26) It is a torment for the proud to see above them,
surrounded and celebrated in glory, those whom they formerly
despised on earth, while they themselves are relegated to the lower
tiers; for hypocrites, to see themselves pierced by a light that
reveals their most secret thoughts, which everyone can read, with
no way to hide or disguise themselves; for hedonists to experience
all temptations and all desires without being able to satisfy them;


                                 104

                Future Punishment according to Spiritism


for misers to see their gold being wasted and not being able to
save it; for the selfish to be deserted by everybody and to suffer
everything they caused others to suffer. They will thirst and no one
will give them anything to drink, they will hunger and no one will
give them anything to eat. No friendly hands will press theirs, no
compassionate voice will console them. They thought of no one
but themselves during their lifetime, so no one will think of them
or show compassion for them after their death.
       27) The only means of avoiding or attenuating the future
consequences of a wrong is by freeing oneself of it as much as
possible in the present life by repairing it so that there is no wrong
left to be more painfully repaired later. The longer reparation for a
wrong is postponed, the more painful and harsh its consequences
will be in the future.
       28) The spirit’s situation in the spirit world is none other
than what it had prepared for itself during its corporeal life. Later,
in another incarnation, it is granted a new opportunity to expiate
and repair the previous one by going through new trials, which it
profits from to a greater or lesser degree depending on its free will.
And if it does not profit from them, it will have to begin again,
each time in more dolorous conditions. Thus, it can be stated
that those who suffer much on the earth have much to expiate, and
those who enjoy apparent happiness in spite of their vices and
uselessness will pay dearly for it in a later existence. This is what
Jesus meant when he said, “Blessed are the afflicted, for they shall
be comforted.” (See The Gospel according to Spiritism, Chap. V)
       29) Of course, God’s mercy is infinite, but it is not blind.
The guilty who are pardoned are not exonerated, and until they
have satisfied justice, they will suffer the consequences of their
wrongs. We must understand infinite mercy to mean that God is
not inexorable, but that God always leaves the door open for the
guilty to return to the good.

                                      Part One - Chapter VII


        30) Since afflictions are temporary and subordinate to
repentance and reparation – both depend on human free will –
the same applies to the punishment and remedies that must aid
in healing the wounds of evil. Spirits who are being punished
are not like galley slaves who have been sentenced to years of
hard labor, but rather are like patients in a hospital who are
suffering from illnesses because of their own fault and who
must now endure the required means of cure with the hope of
being finally healed. They heal more quickly when they precisely
follow the prescriptions of the physician who carefully monitors
them. If they prolong their suffering through their own fault, the
physician is not responsible for it.
        31) To the afflictions that spirits experience during the
spirit life are joined those of their corporeal life: the consequences
of human beings’ imperfections, their passions, the bad use of
their faculties and the expiation of present and past wrongs. It is
during their corporeal life that spirits repair the evils of previous
lives by putting into practice the resolutions they made during
the spirit life. This explains the miseries and vicissitudes that at
first sight seem to have no reason for being. Nonetheless, they
are just, since they were determined in the past and serve on our
course towards perfectibility.40
        32) It is often asked if God would not display more love
towards God’s creatures if they had been created infallible and
therefore exempt from the vices inherent to imperfection. For
such to be the case, God would have had to have created perfect
beings with nothing more to acquire, whether in knowledge or
in morality. Of course, God could have done that, but if not, it
is that out of divine wisdom, God wanted progress to comprise a
general law.

                Future Punishment according to Spiritism


       Human beings are imperfect, and as such are subject to
vicissitudes that are more painful or less so, and since that is the
way things are, we would do better to accept it. Inferring God as
neither good nor just would be an insensitive revolt against God.
       It would have represented true injustice if God had created
privileged beings who were more favored than others, enjoying
without effort the happiness that others could only achieve
through pain or not at all. Divine justice is obvious in the absolute
equality that presides over the creation of spirits. They all have
the same point of departure, and none are distinguished in their
formation by being better endowed than others. There are none
whose evolutionary progress is made easier by exception, and like
all the others, those who finally reach the goal will have had to pass
through the phases of primitiveness and respective trials.
       That said, is there anything more just than the freedom of
action granted to each one? The road to happiness is wide open
to all, and all enjoy the same conditions to attain to it. The law
is ingrained into all consciences and is taught to all. God makes
happiness, not favoritism, the prize for labor, so that each spirit may
receive what it deserves. All are free to labor or do nothing at all for
their advancement. Those who labor sufficiently and quickly are
rewarded sooner, but those who go off the path or waste their time
delay their arrival and can only blame themselves. Good and evil
are voluntary and facultative. Since human beings are free, they are
not fatalistically led one way or the other.
       33) In spite of the diversity in the kinds and degrees of
punishment that imperfect spirits suffer, the penal code of the
future life may be summed up in these three principles:
       1. Suffering is inherent to imperfection.
       2. Every imperfection as well as every wrong resulting from it
brings its own punishment in natural and inevitable consequences.
Hence, sickness results from excess, and boredom from laziness,


                                  107

                        Part One - Chapter VII


without there having to be some kind of special condemnation for
each wrong or individual.
      3. Since all people can free themselves from their imperfections
by their will, they can just as easily annul the ills that result from
them and can ensure their future happiness.
      To each according to his or her deeds, in heaven as well as on
earth – such is the law of divine justice.

natures together – the spiritual and the corporeal, the angelic and
the mundane – and later, as a link between the two, he formed the
human nature, composed of body and spirit.’

       “According to the Faith, such was the divine plan in the work
of creation, a majestic and complete plan as befitting the Eternal
Wisdom. Thus conceived, it offers to our thoughts the created
being in all its degrees and conditions. Purely spiritual existence
and life appear in the highest sphere; purely physical existence and
life appear in the lowest; in between, there is a marvelous union of
these two substances, a life that is at the same time common to the
intelligent spirit and to the organized body.
       “Our soul is of a simple and indivisible nature, but it
is limited in its faculties. Our idea of perfection enables us to
understand that there must be other beings that are as simple as the
soul and yet superior to it due to their qualities and privileges. The
soul is great and noble, but it is associated to matter and is served
by fragile organs that are limited in their action and strength. But
why couldn’t there be other natures that are nobler still, which
are free of such servitude and fetters and endowed with greater
strength and incomparable activity? Before God had set man upon
the earth to know, serve and love him, wouldn’t he have already
called forth other creatures in order to comprise his heavenly
court and worship him in the splendor of his glory? God, after all,
receives from the hands of man the tributes of honor and homage
of this universe. Is it therefore any wonder that he receives from
the hands of angels the incense and prayers of man? Therefore, if
angels did not exist, the Creator’s grand work would not have the
crowning and perfection that are peculiar to it. This world, which
attests to his omnipotence, would no longer be the masterpiece
of his wisdom. Our reason, though feeble and frail, could easily
imagine a more developed and consummated world.
       “On every page of the sacred books of the Old as well as the
New Testaments, mention is made of these sublime intelligences
either in pious invocations or in historical references. Their
intervention appears expressly in the lives of the patriarchs and

prophets. God uses them in his ministry both to impose his will
and to announce future events, and angels are also nearly always
instruments of his justice and mercy. Their presence is constant in
the various circumstances surrounding the birth, life and passion
of the Savior. Their memory is inseparable from great men as well
as the most significant events of religious antiquity. The belief in
angels exists both in the midst of polytheism and the fables of
mythology because such belief is as universal and ancient as the
world itself. The worship offered by the pagans to good and evil
spirits was no more than an erroneous application of the truth, a
faint remainder of primitive dogma.
        “The words of the holy Lateran Council contain a fundamental
distinction between angels and men, teaching us that the former are
pure spirits, whereas the latter are composed of a body and a soul;
i.e., the angelic nature subsists in and of itself, not only without
mixture but without any real possible association with matter at all,
no matter how vaporous and subtle it may be perceived to be, while
our soul, which is also spiritual, is associated to the body so as to
form with it one and the same person, and this is essentially its destiny.
        “As long as this very intimate union between the soul and
body exists, these two substances have a common life and exert a
mutual influence on each other; thus, the soul cannot completely
free itself from the imperfections of such a condition: ideas come
to it through the senses by comparing exterior objects and always
under images that are more obvious or less so. That is why the
soul cannot contemplate itself or conceive of God and the angels
without attributing a visible and tangible form to them. The
same applies to angels, who, in order to manifest to the saints and
prophets, had to take on tangible and visible forms. These forms,
however, were no more than aerial bodies which they used to move
about and identify themselves, or they were symbolic attributes
related to the mission with which they were charged.

                        Part One - Chapter VIII


       “Their being and movements are neither localized nor
circumscribed to any limited or fixed point in space. Since they are
not connected to a physical body, they cannot be stopped or limited
by other objects as we are. They do not occupy any given place and
do not fill any void. However, in the same way that our soul is fully
within our body and each one of its parts, angels are also fully and
almost simultaneously at all points and in all parts of the world.
They are faster than thought and can be anywhere in the blink of an
eye, acting by themselves with no other obstacle to their desires than
the will of the Creator and the resistance of human freedom.
       “While we are condemned to see external things slowly and
narrowly, and while supernatural truths appear to us as enigmas in
a mirror (according to St. Paul), angels effortlessly see what they
must know and are always in direct relation with the object of
their thought. Their knowledge is not the result of induction and
reasoning, but of clear and profound intuition that encompasses all
at once the principles and consequences resulting from it.
       “Distances of time, differences in place and the multiplicity
of objects cannot cause any confusion in their minds.
       “Because it is infinite, the divine essence is incomprehensible.
It holds mysteries and depths that cannot be grasped. The innermost
designs of Providence remain concealed even from the angels, but
their secrets are unveiled to them when in certain circumstances
they are charged with announcing them to mankind.
       “God’s communications with angels and their communications
amongst themselves are not made by means of articulated sounds
and other gestures. Pure intelligences have no need of eyes to see
or ears to hear, much less a vocal organ to express their thoughts;
hence, this instrument, so common to us, is unnecessary for them
and they communicate their sentiments in a way that is peculiar to
them only: it is completely spiritual. To make themselves understood
by one another, their will is sufficient.


                                 112

                                   Angels


       “Only God knows how many angels there are. Their number
is obviously not infinite, and it could not be otherwise; however,
according to the sacred authors and holy doctors of the Church, it
is considerable and truly prodigious. If it is natural to proportion
the number of the inhabitants of a city to its grandeur and extent,
and since the earth is only an atom in comparison to the firmament
and the immense regions of space, we would have to conclude that
the number of the inhabitants of the air and heaven is much greater
than that of men.
       “Since the majesty of kings derives its splendor from the number
of their subjects, vassals and officials, what could give us a better idea of
the majesty of the King of kings than the innumerable host of angels
that populate the heavens of earth, sea and abysses, and the dignity of
those who, without pause, remain prostrate or standing at his throne?
       “The Church Fathers and theologians generally teach
that the angels may be divided into three great hierarchies or
principalities, and each hierarchy into three companies or choirs.
       “Those of the first and highest hierarchy are designated
according to the functions they perform in heaven. Some are
called Seraphim, so designated for the ardor of love which they
radiate before God. Others are called Cherubim because they are a
luminous reflection of the divine wisdom, and still others Thrones,
so called because they proclaim the grandeur of the Creator, whose
splendor they manifest.
       “The angels of the second hierarchy have received names
in keeping with the functions attributed to them in the general
governance of the universe. They are: Dominions, who determine
the missions and duties of angels of the lower classes; Virtues,
who attend to the miracles required by the great interests of
the Church and mankind in general; and Powers, who by their
strength and vigilance protect the laws that govern the physical
and mental worlds.


                                    113

                                        Part One - Chapter VIII


       “Those of the third hierarchy share the mission of guiding
societies and individuals. They are: Principalities, who are
appointed to kingdoms, provinces and dioceses; Archangels, who
transmit messages of greatest importance, and Guardian Angels,
who accompany each one of us in order to watch over our security
and sanctification.”

                                          Refutation
        3. The general principle resulting from this doctrine is that
angels are purely spirit- beings, who existed prior to humans and
are superior to them. They are privileged creatures who were destined
to supreme and eternal bliss at their creation, endowed by their very
nature with every virtue and all knowledge, but without having ever
done anything to acquire it. They are on the highest plane of creation,
in contrast to the lowest, where life is purely physical. Humans exist
halfway between the two; that is, humans are composed of souls,
spirit-beings inferior to the angels and connected to material bodies.
        Crucial problems result from such a system. First, what is life
that is purely material? Does it consist of brute matter? But brute matter
is inanimate and has no life in and of itself. Does it perchance refer to
animals and plants? If so, it would be a fourth order within creation,
because one cannot deny that there is something in the intelligent
animal that is more than in the plant, and in the plant more than in the
stone. As for the human soul – which comprises a transition point – it
remains directly united to a body, which is merely brute matter, for
without a soul, the body has as much life as a clod of dirt.
        Obviously, this division is obscure for lack of clarity and
does not square with observation. It is similar to the theory of
the four basic elements43, which was annulled by the progress of

43
     Earth, water, fire and air – Tr.



                                                 114

                               Angels


science. Nevertheless, let us accept these three terms: the spirit
creature, the human creature and the corporeal creature, for such
is (they say) the divine plan – majestic and complete, befitting
of the Eternal Wisdom. We should notice before anything else
that there is no necessary connection between these three terms,
and that they are three distinct creations, formed successively,
whereas from one to the next, there is continuity. Everything in
nature is linked together, showing us a law of admirable unity,
and whose elements, though simple transformations of one
another, all have their connecting vestiges. That theory is to a
certain extent true regarding the existence of the three terms;
however, it is incomplete since it lacks points of contact between
them, as is easy to demonstrate.
       The Church says that these three culminating points of
creation are necessary for the harmony of the whole. If only one
were missing, the entire work would be incomplete and would
not correspond to the Eternal Wisdom. Nonetheless, one of the
Church’s fundamental dogmas states that the earth, the animals,
the plants, the sun and the stars – even light itself – were created
out of nothing about 6,000 years ago. Before that time, there was
neither human nor corporeal creature; that is, throughout the rest
of preceding eternity, the divine work had remained incomplete.
The creation of the universe 6,000 years ago comprises an article
of faith that is so crucial that only a few years ago science was
anathematized because it destroyed the biblical chronology by
proving the great antiquity of the earth and its inhabitants.
       In spite of this, the Lateran Council, the ecumenical council
that drew up law in matters of doctrine, affirmed: “We firmly
believe that there is only one true God, eternal and infinite, who
at the beginning of time took from nothingness two created natures
together – the spiritual and the corporeal...” By at the beginning
of time we can only infer eternity up to that point, since infinite


                                115

                        Part One - Chapter VIII


time, like space, has neither beginning nor end. That expression
beginning of time is thus a figure of speech that implies the idea of an
unlimited previousness. The Lateran Council thus believed firmly
that spirit creatures as well as corporeal ones were simultaneously
formed and taken together from nothingness at an indeterminate
time in the past. Thus, what becomes of the biblical text that sets
creation at 6,000 of our years? Admitting that the beginning of the
visible universe could have been at that time, it surely must not be
regarded as the beginning of time. Which should we believe: the
Council or the Bible?
       5. The same Council formulated another strange
proposition: “Our soul, which is also spiritual, is associated to the
body so as to form with it one and the same person, and this is
essentially its destiny.” Now, if the essential destiny of the soul is
to be united to the body, this union would constitute its normal
state, its purpose, its objective, since such is its destiny. However,
the soul is immortal while the body is not; the soul’s union with it
only occurs once, according to the Church, and even if the union
were to last a century, what would that be in relation to eternity?
And since it only lasts a few hours for many, what usefulness
would there be for the soul in such an ephemeral union? When,
in relation to eternity, its longest duration would be no more than
an imperceptible moment, would it really be precise to say that its
destiny is essentially to be connected to the body? Actually, this union
is no more than one incident, one stage in the life of the soul – it
is not its essential state.
       If the essential destiny of the soul is to be connected
to the human body, if by its nature and according to the
providential purpose of creation this union is necessary for the
manifestations of its faculties, we must obviously conclude that
without a body, the human soul is an incomplete being. And so
that the soul may fulfill its purposes, then in leaving behind


                                  116

                                Angels


one body, it needs to take on another, which necessarily leads
us to the plurality of existences, in other words, to ongoing
reincarnation. It is truly strange that a council regarded as one
of the bright spots of the Church identified the spirit being
with the material being at this point in such a way that one
cannot exist without the other, since the essential condition of
their creation is that they remain joined.
      6. The hierarchical table of angels shows us that various
orders have as their attributes the governing of the physical world
and humankind – the purpose for which they were created.
According to Genesis, however, neither the physical world nor
humankind existed until 6,000 years ago, so what would these
angels have done before that time, during the eternity when the
object of their concern did not yet exist? Have angels been created
throughout all eternity? Such must have been the case, since they
were meant for the glorification of the Almighty. But if they had
been created at some determined time, then until that point, i.e.
throughout eternity, God would have been without worshipers.
      7. The Council further stated: “As long as this intimate union
between the soul and body lasts.” Consequently, is there a time in
which this union does not exist? This proposition contradicts the
one making the union the essential destiny of the soul.
      The Council stated still further, “Ideas come to them
through the senses, in the comparison of exterior objects.” This is a
philosophical doctrine that is partly true, but not so in its absolute
sense. According to the eminent theologian, receiving ideas
through the senses is a condition inherent to human nature, but he
forgets innate ideas, faculties that are at times highly transcendent,
and the intuition about things that children bring with them at
birth that are not due to any kind of instruction. By means of
what senses did those young herdsmen, natural calculators who
aroused the wonder of scholars, acquire the ideas needed to almost


                                 117

                       Part One - Chapter VIII


instantly resolve the most complicated problems? We would ask
the same regarding precocious musicians, painters and linguists.
       “Angels’ knowledge does not result from induction and
reasoning”; they have it simply because they are angels, without
having to learn it because they were created that way by God. The
soul, however, must learn. If the soul only received ideas by means
of the corporeal organs, what ideas could the soul of a child who
dies after a few days have if we believe along with the Church that
such a soul is not reborn?
       8. This raises a vital issue: Can the soul acquire ideas and
knowledge after the death of the body? If it cannot acquire new
knowledge once freed from the body, then the soul of the child,
the primitive, the mentally impaired or uneducated individual will
remain as it was at the time of death, condemned to nullity forever.
But if, on the contrary, it acquires new knowledge after its current
lifetime, then it can progress. Without the soul’s later progress,
one must reach absurd conclusions. With progress, we come to
the negation of all dogmas founded on the soul’s stationary nature:
immutable fate, eternal punishment, etc. If the soul progresses,
where does its progress stop? There is no reason for it not to attain
the degree of the angels or pure spirits, and with such a possibility
there would be no justification for the creation of special and
privileged beings who are exempt from any labor and who
unconditionally enjoy eternal bliss, while other less-favored beings
can only attain to such bliss by enduring long, cruel suffering and
harsh trials. God could have undoubtedly planned it that way, but
if we believe in the infinitude of the divine perfections, without
which God would not be God, we are also forced to believe that
God does nothing useless, nothing that could contradict God’s
supreme justice and goodness.
       9. “Since the majesty of kings is displayed in the number
of their subjects, their officials and servants, then what could be


                                118

                               Angels


more fitting for giving us an idea of the majesty of the King of
kings than that numberless host of angels that populate heaven
and earth, sea and abyss, and the worthiness of those who constantly
remain prostrate or standing at the foot of his throne?”
       Wouldn’t it belittle God to compare the divine glory to the
ostentation of earthly sovereigns? Such ideas, inculcated within
the spirit of the uneducated masses, falsify the idea of God’s
true grandeur, and always reduce God to the petty proportions
of humankind. To suppose that God must need millions of
worshipers constantly prostrating themselves or standing in the
divine presence is to endow God with the weakness of despotic
and proud monarchs. What makes truly great sovereigns? Is
it the number and glamour of their courtiers? No. It is their
goodness, justice and a title worthy of leaders of their subjects.
One might ask if there is something more appropriate for giving
us an idea of God’s grandeur and majesty than a host of angels
comprising the divine court. Well, of course there is. It is to
represent God to all God’s creatures as supremely good, just and
merciful, instead of wrathful, jealous, vengeful, unforgiving,
life-threatening and partial, creating for God’s own glory those
privileged angel-beings, endowed with all the divine gifts and
born for eternal bliss, while imposing sorrowful conditions on
others in their acquisition of happiness and punishing them with
eternal suffering for a moment of error.
       10. Regarding the union of soul and body, Spiritism
professes an infinitely more spiritualistic doctrine, not to mention
less materialistic, and which furthermore is in accord with the
observation and destiny of the soul. Spiritism teaches us that
the soul is independent of the body; the body is nothing more
than a temporary envelope. Spirituality is the soul’s essence and its
normal life is the spirit life. The body is only an instrument for
the soul to exercise its faculties in relating to the physical world.


                                119

                        Part One - Chapter VIII


However, separated from this body, it enjoys these same faculties
more freely and broadly.
       11. The soul’s union with a body is necessary for its initial
progress and thus occurs only during the period that we may
classify as its childhood and adolescence. However, when the soul
has reached a certain degree of purification and dematerialization,
this union is no longer required and the soul continues to evolve in
the spirit world. Moreover, no matter how numerous its corporeal
existences may be, they are necessarily limited to the existence of
the body, and their sum total does not in any case entail but an
imperceptible part of the unlimited spirit life.

            Angels according to Spiritism
       12. There is no doubt that there are beings endowed with all
the qualities attributed to angels. Spiritist revelation on this point
confirms the belief of all cultures and enables us to know both the
nature and the origin of such beings.
       Souls or spirits are created simple and ignorant, that is,
without knowledge or awareness of good and evil, but they are
capable of acquiring all they lack through labor. The goal, which
is perfection, is the same for all. The speed at which they achieve
it depends on their free will and their own efforts. All must ascend
through the same degrees and must accomplish the same work.
God imposes neither a heavier nor lighter obligation on some than
on others, for God is just, and since they are all God’s children,
there are no favorites. God says to them: Here is the law that must
comprise your rule of conduct; this law will lead you to your goal;
everything conforming to it is good; everything contrary to it is
evil. You have complete freedom to obey or break this law, and
thus you shall be the arbiters of your own destiny. Consequently,
God did not create evil. All the divine laws are for the good, and

                                 120

                                                 Angels


it was human beings who created evil by infringing upon them.
If they had scrupulously obeyed them, they would never have
deviated from the moral path.
        13. The soul, however, is like the child during the first
phases of its existence, in that it lacks experience, and that is why
it is fallible. God does not give it experience directly but gives it
the means of acquiring it: each wrong step on the path of evil is a
delay for the soul, which in suffering the consequences, learns at
its own expense what it should avoid. In this way, it develops little
by little, perfects itself, and advances in the spirit hierarchy44 until
it reaches the state of a pure spirit or angel. Angels are thus human
souls who have attained the degree of perfection that creatures are
capable of, enjoying promised bliss in all its fullness. However,
before reaching the supreme degree, they enjoy a happiness that is
relative to their advancement; their happiness does not consist in
idleness but in the tasks with which it has pleased God to entrust
to them. Such occupations are regarded as a means of progress.
(See chap. III, “Heaven”)
        14. Human beings are not limited to the earth: they inhabit
countless worlds revolving through space; they once inhabited
worlds that have already disappeared and they will inhabit those
that are yet to form. God has created throughout all eternity and
has never ceased doing so. Long before the earth existed, and
farther back than we could ever conceive, there were other worlds
on which incarnate spirits traversed the same stages that are being
traversed by more recently-formed spirits such as ourselves, and
who reached their goal before we had even left the hands of the
Creator. Throughout all eternity, then, there have been pure spirits
or angels, but since their human existence is lost in the infinite
past, we believe they have always been angels.

                       Part One - Chapter VIII


       15. This is what the great law of the unity of creation
reveals to us. God has never been inactive and has always had
pure, experienced and enlightened spirits to transmit the divine
orders and direct all parts of the universe, from the governance of
entire worlds on down to the minutest details. As a result, God
has not needed to create privileged beings exempt from the duty
to progress. All – ancient and new – have acquired their position
through struggle and their own merit. In the end, all are children of
their own deeds. Thus God’s supreme justice is equitably fulfilled.

    The Origin of the Belief in Demons • Demons according
        to the Church • Demons according to Spiritism



      The Origin of the Belief in Demons
      1. Throughout time, demons have represented a prominent
role in various theogonies. Although they have been dismissed
from mainstream thinking, the importance still attributed to
them nowadays lends the issue a certain seriousness because it
addresses the very foundation of religious belief. Consequently, it
is appropriate for us to examine it in all its aspects.
      The belief in a superior power is instinctive in human
beings. We find it under different forms and throughout the
world’s history. However, if today – given the degree of intellectual
refinement that we have reached – there is still much discussion
regarding the nature and attributes of this power, how much
more imperfect people’s ideas regarding it in the initial phases of
humankind must have been!
      2. The picture portrayed of the innocence of primitive
peoples in awe before the beauties of nature, marveling at the
goodness of the Creator is, without a doubt, very poetic but far
removed from reality. In fact, the closer humans come to the
primitive state, the more they are dominated by instinct, as may

                                123

                                 Part One - Chapter IX


still be seen today in various barbaric and primitive cultures. What
they are most preoccupied with – what they are occupied with
exclusively – is the satisfaction of their material needs, for they
really have no others. The sense that can render humans accessible
to purely mental pleasures develops only slowly and gradually. The
soul goes through its own childhood, adolescence and adulthood
just like the human body, but in order for it to attain the maturity
that will enable it to comprehend purely abstract things, how
much more evolution the soul still has to undergo in the human
form! Through so many lifetimes it must still pass!
        Without having to look back on more primitive eras, we
only need look around at rural populations and examine the sense
of wonder that is awakened in them at the splendor of a sunrise,
the starry firmament, the chirping of the birds, the crashing of the
waves or the flowered fields of the meadows. For such people, the
sun rises out of habit, and as long as it releases enough heat to ripen
the crops without burning them up, that is all they expect. They
look at the sky to know if good or bad weather is approaching,
and whether or not the birds sing is unimportant as long as they
do not eat the seed they have sown. They prefer the clucking of the
hen and the grunt of the pig to the songs of the nightingale. What
they want from crystalline or muddy creeks is that they neither dry
up nor flood; from their fields, that they produce good grass with
or without flowers. That is all they desire, and what is more, it is
everything they comprehend about nature, and they are already far
removed from primitive humans!45
        3. If we look back on primitive humans, we will be surprised
at how exclusively preoccupied they were with satisfying their
material needs; that which could help or harm them summed up
good and evil for them. They believed in an extra-human power,

45
     This was written in 1865, before the technology and modes of communication (TVs, PCs,
     phones, newspapers, etc.) that today exist in most rural areas and farmhouses, poorer
     countries’ rural conditions notwithstanding. – Tr.



                                            124

                              Demons


and because physical harm was what impressed them most, they
attributed it to this power, although they had a very vague idea as
to what this power was exactly. And since they could not conceive
of anything outside the visible and tangible world, they imagined
that this power dwelled in the beings and things that were harmful
to them. Dangerous animals were thus its natural and direct
representatives. By the same token, they saw the personification
of the good in useful things, giving rise to the worship of certain
animals, plants and even inanimate objects. However, human
beings are normally more sensitive to evil than good, so that
whatever was good seemed merely natural to them, whereas
whatever was evil had more impact on them. For this reason, in
primitive worship the ceremonies in honor of a malefic power
were always more numerous: fear supplanted gratitude.
       For a long time, humans only understood good and evil
from a physical point of view; only later did moral sentiments of
good and evil signal the progress of humans’ intelligence, enabling
them to foresee spirituality and to understand that an extra-human
power lay beyond the visible world and not in material things.
This fact was of course grasped by a few select minds, which could
not, however, go beyond certain limits.
       4. Since there was an incessant struggle between good
and evil, with the latter often triumphing over the former, and
since one could not rationally believe that evil could derive from
a benevolent power, it was concluded that there were two rival
powers governing the world. From this arose the doctrine of two
principles: good and evil, which was a logical doctrine at a time in
which humans were still incapable of conceiving of any other and
of comprehending the nature of the Supreme Being. Consequently,
how could they understand that evil was no more than a transitory
state from which good could arise, and that the ills that afflicted
them could lead them to happiness and aid in their evolution? The


                                125

                           Part One - Chapter IX


limits of their moral horizon would not allow them to see beyond
the present life – neither the past nor the future; therefore, they
could not understand that they had already evolved individually,
or that they would evolve further, much less that the vicissitudes of
life were the result of the imperfections of the spirit being residing
within them, and who pre-exists and survives the body, purifying
itself over a series of lifetimes until it finally reaches perfection. In
order to understand how evil could result in good, one must take
not just one but many existences into account. One must consider
them as a unity, because only then do true causes and their effects
become clear.
        5. The dual principle of good and evil was for many centuries
and under various names the basis for all religious beliefs. We see
it personified in Ohura Mazda and Ahriman among the Persians,
and in Yahweh and Satan among the Hebrews. However, just as
every sovereign must have his or her ministers, all religions have
generally believed in secondary powers – good or evil spirits. The
pagans represented them as countless individualities under the
generic label of “gods”, and endowed them with special attributes
for good and for evil, for vice and for virtue. Christians and
Muslims inherited angels and demons from the Hebrews.
        6. The doctrine of demons, consequently, has its origin in
the ancient belief in the two principles of good and evil. Here we
will examine it only from the Christian point of view in order
to see if it is in accord with the more precise ideas we possess
nowadays regarding the attributes of the Divinity.
        These attributes are the starting point, the basis for all religious
doctrine. Dogmas, creeds, ceremonies, practices and morality –
everything is related to the varying degrees of correctness and elevation
of the ideas that have been formed about God from fetishism up to
Christianity. If the essence of God continues to be a mystery to our
minds, we nevertheless comprehend it better than before, thanks to


                                    126

                                 Demons


the teachings of Christ. Christianity rationally teaches us that: God
is unique, eternal, unchangeable, immaterial, omnipotent, supremely
just and good, infinite in all the divine perfections.
        As we stated previously (chap. VI, “The Doctrine of Eternal
Punishment”): “If only a small portion of only one of God’s
attributes were removed, there would no longer be God, for then
another more perfect being might possibly exist.” These attributes
in all their absolute fullness are therefore the criteria for all religions,
the measuring stick of the truth of each one of the principles they
teach. Moreover, for any one of such principles to be true, it must
not contravene any of God’s perfections. Let us see if the common
doctrine of demons measures up to this requirement.

         Demons according to the Church
       7. According to the Church, Satan, the chief or king of the
demons, is not an allegorical personification of evil, but is a real
entity who practices evil exclusively, whereas God practices good
exclusively. Let us take him precisely as he is represented.
       Has Satan existed throughout eternity like God, or did he
come along later? If he has existed for all eternity, then he would
be non-created and therefore equal to God. God in turn would
no longer be unique, because there would also be a God of evil.
But what if Satan came later? In that case, Satan could only be
one of God’s creatures. As such, since he practices only evil and is
incapable of practicing good and of repenting, God would have
had to have created a being devoted exclusively and eternally to
evil. However, since evil cannot be the work of God but of one
of his creatures predestined to practice it, God would nonetheless
always be its primary author, and in that case, God would not be
infinitely good. The exact same applies regarding the evil beings
called demons.

                                   Part One - Chapter IX


       8. For a long time, such was the Church’s belief regarding
the matter. Nowadays, its position is as follows46:
       “God, who is goodness and holiness in essence, did not
create them perverse and evil. The paternal hand (with which he
is pleased to impress all his works with the stamp of his infinite
perfections) bestowed upon them the most magnificent gifts.
To the highly eminent qualities of their nature he added the
abundance of his grace. He made them equal in every way to the
sublime spirits who are in the state of glory and bliss. Distributed
amongst all the spirit orders and mingled amongst all the classes,
they had the same purpose and identical destiny. Their chief
was the most beautiful of the archangels. They could have even
merited their position among the righteous forever, and could have
been admitted into the delight of the blessedness of heaven. This
ultimate favor, which would have completed all the favors that had
until then been granted, would have comprised the reward of their
docility; however, they became unworthy through a senseless and
audacious revolt.
       “What kept them from remaining steadfast? What truth
did they not realize? What act of faith and adoration did they
refuse to offer God? The Church and the annals of holy history say
nothing about the matter for certain, but it does seem certain that
they neither acquiesced to the mediation of the Son of God nor to
the exaltation of the human nature in Jesus Christ.
       “The Divine Word, creator of all things, is also the sole
mediator and savior both on earth and in heaven. The supernatural
destiny was given to angels and men only in preparation for the
Word’s incarnation and merit, for there is no relation between
the work of the most eminent spirits and that recompense which
46
     The following citations are taken from the pastoral letter of Monsignor Gousset, Cardinal
     Archbishop of Reims, for Lent in 1865. Considering the personal merit and position of the
     author, we can regard them as a definitive expression of the Church on the doctrine of
     demons. – Auth.

is none other than God himself. No creature could fulfill such a
destiny apart from that wonderful and sublime intervention of
charity. And in order to fill in the infinite distance that separates
his essence from the essence of his works, he had to join these two
extremes within his own person and associate his divinity to the
nature of either an angel or a man; he chose the human nature.
       “This plan, conceived from all eternity, was divulged to the
angels long before it was carried out: the God-Man was shown
to them as the One who would confirm them in grace and guide
them to glory, but under the condition that they worship him
during his earthly mission and forever and ever in heaven. This
was an unexpected revelation, a delightful vision for generous and
grateful hearts, but a profound and humiliating mystery for proud
spirits! That supernatural destiny, that immense glory that had
been offered to them would not be the result solely of their own
personal worth! They would never be able to attribute the right
to such glory to themselves alone! A mediator between God and
them – what an insult to their dignity! This unexpected preference
granted to the human nature! How unjust! Such an affront to
their rights! And would they someday have to behold that human
nature – so inferior to their own – deified by being united with the
Word, seated at the right hand of God on a resplendent throne?
Would they agree to pay homage and adoration to that nature for
the rest of eternity?
       “Lucifer and a third of the angels succumbed to such envious
and proud thoughts. St. Michael and most with him exclaimed,
“Who is like unto God? He is the owner of his gifts, the sovereign
Lord of all things. Glory to God and to the Lamb, who will be slain
for the salvation of the world!” The head of the rebels, however,
forgetting that he owed all his nobility and prerogatives to God,
preferred to listen to his own impulsiveness and proclaimed, “It
is I who shall ascend into heaven; I shall set my dwelling above


                                129

                                     Part One - Chapter IX


the stars; I shall sit upon the Mount of Alliance, on the flanks
of Aquilon; I shall rule the highest clouds and shall be like the
Most High.” Those from all the hierarchies who shared in his
sentiments received these words with murmurs of approval, but
their vast numbers did not safeguard them from punishment.”
       9. This doctrine raises several objections:
       1. If Satan and the demons had been angels, they would
have been perfect. Being perfect, could they have failed to the
point of not recognizing the authority of the God in whose
presence they stood? If they had arrived at such eminence
gradually, after having traversed the ranks of imperfection, we
might conceive of such a sad regression, but what makes the
problem most incomprehensible is that they are portrayed as
having been created perfect from the start.
       The conclusion is this: God willed to create perfect beings,
endowed with every gift possible, but God made a mistake. Thus,
according to the Church, God is not infallible.47
       2. Since neither the Church nor the sacred annals explain the
cause of the angels’ revolt against God, but only state that it does
seem certain that it resulted from their reluctance to acknowledge
the future mission of Christ, what value can we place on such a
precise and detailed picture of the scenario which took place on that
occasion? In what source may we find such clear expressions and
even complaints, which have been reproduced as actually having
been pronounced on that occasion? One of two things applies:
either the scenario is true or it is not. If it is true, there can be no
47
      This outrageous doctrine is corroborated by the Mosaic record in Genesis 6:6,7: “[God]
     repented for having created man on the earth, and pierced by pain to the bottom of his
     heart, he said, ‘I will wipe man, whom I created, from the face of the earth; I will exterminate
     everything, from men to animals, from those that crawl upon the ground to the birds in
     the sky, because I repent for having created them.’ A God who repented for what God had
     made would be neither perfect nor infallible, and therefore would not be God. But such
     are the words that the Church proclaims as sacred truths. Moreover, it is unconceivable as
     to what the animals could have had in common with the perversity of human beings that
     would merit their being exterminated along with them. – Auth.

uncertainty. But then why hasn’t the Church decided the matter?
However, if the Church and history are silent, if the matter only
seems certain, then it obviously is no more than a theory and this
descriptive scene is merely the fruit of imagination.48
        3. The words attributed to Lucifer portray a surprising
ignorance for an archangel who, by his very nature and the degree
he had reached, could not share – as far as the organization of
the universe is concerned – in the same errors and prejudices that
were professed by humankind until science enlightened them.
For instance, how could he say: “I shall set my dwelling above the
stars and rule the highest clouds”? It is the same old belief that the
earth was the center of the universe, that the sky, formed of clouds,
extended to the limited region of the star-formed canopy, but
which astronomy has shown to extend to infinity in infinite space.
Since we know today that clouds do not extend beyond a few miles
above the earth, in saying that he would rule the highest clouds, in
addition to referring to the mountains, it would be necessary that
the observation was occurring while on the earth and that there, in
fact, was the dwelling place of the angels. However, if their dwelling
was in the heavenly regions, it would obviously be senseless to say
that it was situated well beyond the clouds. Attributing to the angels
48
      Isaiah 14: 11ff. contains the following scene: “Your pride has been cast into hell; your dead
     body has fallen upon the ground; your bed shall be rotten and your garment shall be worms.
     How have you fallen, O Lucifer, you who shined so brightly at daybreak? How have you been
     thrown down to the earth, you, who smote the nations with your blows, and who said in
     your heart, ‘I shall ascend into heaven; I shall establish my throne above the stars of God; I
     shall sit upon the Mount of Alliance on the flanks of the Aquilon; I shall sit above the highest
     clouds and I shall be like the Most High?’ However, your glory has been brought down to
     hell, to the depths of the abyss. Those who see you approach shall say: “Is this the man who
     used to terrorize the earth, who filled kingdoms with terror and transformed the world into
     a desert, and who destroyed cities and retained in chains those he had made prisoners?”
     These words of the prophet do not refer to the revolt of the angels; rather, they are alluding
     to the pride and fall of the king of Babylon, who held the Jews in captivity – attested to
     in the final verses. The king of Babylon is allegorically designated as Lucifer, but it makes
     absolutely no mention of the scene described above. Those words refer to the king who
     spoke them within his heart and proudly placed himself above God, whose people he held
     captive. Moreover, the prophecy concerning the liberation of the Jews, the ruin of Babylon
     and the defeat of the Assyrians is the exclusive object of that chapter. – Auth.

a language sullied with ignorance would be asserting that modern
humans are wiser than the angels. The Church has always erred by
not taking the progress of science into account.
       10. The Church’s response to the first objection is found
in the following statement: “Scripture and tradition call heaven
the place into which the angels were placed at the time of their
creation. However, this was not the heaven of heavens, the heaven
of the beatific vision, wherein God shows his face to his elect as
they clearly and effortlessly contemplate him because there are no
longer any dangers or possibility of sin; temptation and doubt are
unknown there; justice, peace and bliss rule immutably; sanctity
and glory are imperishable. Therefore, it was in another heavenly
region, a luminous and blessed sphere in which such noble
creatures, who were highly favored with divine communications,
should receive them and accept them with faith and humility
before realizing their true reality in the essence of God himself.”
       This statement means that the fallen angels would have
belonged to a less elevated and purified category, not having yet
attained to the supreme place in which error was impossible. Well,
possibly; but then there is a clear contradiction because the text
further states, “God had created them in every way similar to the
sublime spirits who, subdivided into all the orders and mixed in
with all levels, had the same purpose and the same destiny, and
that their chief was the most beautiful of the archangels.” If they
were created in every way similar to the others, they could not
have been of an inferior nature, and if they were mixed in with all
levels, they could not have been in some special place elsewhere.
Therefore, our objection holds up in its entirety.
       11. There is another objection, which is certainly more
serious and grave.
       It is stated: “This plan (the intervention of Christ), conceived
from all eternity, was disclosed to the angels well before it was carried


                                  132

                                             Demons


out.” God knew, therefore, from all eternity that the angels, as well
as human beings, would require this intervention. Moreover, God
either knew or did not know that some of the angels would fail and
that their fall would carry eternal condemnation with no hope of
return; that they would be destined to tempt humans who, if they
allowed themselves to be seduced, would suffer the same fate. If God
knew about all this beforehand, it would mean that God created the
angels for the purpose of their irrevocable loss and for the loss of
most of humankind. No matter what is said, it is impossible for us
to associate such a creation with God’s supreme goodness. If God
did not know it beforehand, then God is not omnipotent. In either
case we see a negation of two divine attributes, and without their
absolute fullness, God would not be God.
       12. If we believe that the fallibility of the angels is like that
of humans, punishment is a just and natural consequence of the
wrong that has been committed, but if we at the same time believe
in the possibility of redemption, the return to goodness and grace
after repentance and expiation, then there is nothing that refutes
the goodness of God. God indeed knew that they would fail and
would be punished, but God also knew that such temporary
punishment would be a means of enabling them to understand
their wrong and that it would finally turn to their advantage.
Hence these words from the prophet Ezekiel: “God does not
will the death of the sinner, but his salvation.”49 The futility of
repentance and the impossibility of regeneration would be a denial
of the divine goodness. In accepting such a hypothesis it would
be strictly true to say: Since God could not have been unaware of it,
then from their very creation these angels were doomed forever to evil
and predestined to become demons in order to entice humans to evil.
       13. Let us now take a look at the fate of these angels and
what they now do:
49

       “The revolt had barely expressed itself in the language of
these spirits, i.e. the impetus of their thoughts, before they were
irrevocably banished from the celestial mansion and cast down
into the abyss.
       “By such words, we are to understand that they were
relegated to a place of torment in which they would suffer the
punishment of fire, according to the Gospel text, which is the
word of the Savior, ‘Go, you who are accursed, into the eternal fire
prepared for the Devil and his angels.’ St. Peter expressly states,
‘God bound them in chains and infernal tortures,’ but not all
of them would remain there all the time, for they would finally
be forever imprisoned with the reprobate only at the end of the
world. Presently, God still allows them to occupy a place in the
creation to which they belong and within the order of things to
which their existence is connected, in the relationships they must
have with men and from which they commit the most pernicious
abuse. While some remain within their dark abode, serving as
instruments of divine justice against the unfortunate souls they have
seduced, an infinite number of others, forming invisible legions
under the control of their chiefs, reside in the lower layers of the
atmosphere, traveling here and there throughout the entire globe.
They involve themselves in all that transpires here, frequently
taking an active part in earthly events.”
       The subject concerning the words of Christ regarding the
torment of eternal fire was treated in chap. IV, “Hell.”
       14. According to this doctrine, only a portion of the demons
are in hell. The rest roam about freely, involving themselves in
everything that occurs here, having been given the pleasure of
practicing evil until the world ends at an indeterminate time that
will probably not come very soon. But why such a distinction? Are
those of the latter group less guilty? Obviously not, unless they
alternate roles as could be inferred from the words, “While some


                                134

                              Demons


remain within their dark abode, serving as instruments of divine
justice against the unfortunate souls they have seduced.”
       Their occupation therefore consists in tormenting the
souls they have seduced. Thus, they are not in charge of punishing
the souls who are guilty of wrongs they freely and intentionally
committed, but of those whom they, the demons themselves,
provoked. They are at the same time the cause of the wrong and
the instrument of its punishment, something, strangely enough, that
even human justice in its imperfection would not allow: that the
victims who succumb out of weakness in circumstances beyond
their will are equally or more severely punished than the agents
who, through cunning and artifice, caused them to err. Moreover,
when they leave the earth behind, these victims go to hell never to
leave it. They suffer eternally without respite or grace, whereas the
ones who caused their downfall enjoy a deferment of payment and
freedom until the end of the world! Isn’t God’s justice supposed to
be more perfect than human justice?
       15. That is not all, however: “God allows them to occupy
a place within creation and in the relationships they must have
with men, and in which they commit the most pernicious abuse.”
Nevertheless, couldn’t God know about the abuse they would
commit out of the freedom granted to them? Then why would
God have granted it to them? However, in this case, it is with
full knowledge of the facts that God delivers God’s creatures to
their own mercy, knowing out of divine omniscience that they
will succumb and incur the same fate as the demons. Aren’t they
sufficiently weak in and of themselves without having to be
provoked to evil by an enemy who is both dangerous and invisible?
If only punishment were temporary and the guilty could save
themselves through reparation! But no: condemnation is eternal!
Their repentance, their return to the good and their regret are
beside the point.

                        Part One - Chapter IX


       Demons are therefore nothing more than causative agents
and destined to recruit souls to hell with the permission of God,
who upon creating them foresaw the fate that awaited them. What
would we on the earth say about a judge who resorted to similar
means to fill the prisons? That would be a strange idea about the
Divinity, the God whose essential attributes are supreme justice
and goodness! And such doctrines are taught in the name of Jesus,
the one who preached love, charity and forgiveness! There was a
time in which such anomalies passed unnoticed because they were
neither understood nor sensed; humans, bent under the yoke of
religious despotism, submitted to them out of blind faith, or rather
reason gone awry. Today, however, their hour of emancipation has
sounded. They understand justice and they desire it both during
their lifetime and after their death. Thus, they proclaim, “God is
not like that or God would not be God.”
       16. “Punishment follows the fallen and accursed beings
everywhere. They carry hell within them. They know neither
peace nor repose, and the sweetness of hope has been transformed
into bitterness, making them hateful. God’s hand has struck them
with punishment in the very act of sinning and their will has been
hardened in evil. Having become wicked, they persist in being so
and will be so forever.
       “After their sin, they became what men are after death.
Rehabilitation for those who fell has become impossible. From then
on their loss was irreparable and they have remained proud before
God, hateful towards Christ and envious of humanity ever since.
       “Not having been able to win the glory of heaven for
themselves due to their excessive ambition, they endeavor to
establish their empire on the earth and to banish God’s kingdom
from it. In spite of this, the incarnate Word fulfilled his plan for
the salvation and glory of humanity. Thus, demons have sought
through all means to assure the loss of souls he has redeemed:


                                136

                              Demons


artifice and importunity, lying and seduction – they put everything
into play in order to entice them to evil and ensure their ruin.
       “With such enemies, the lives of men cannot help but be
a perpetual struggle from birth to grave, for these enemies are
powerful and untiring.
       “Actually, these enemies are the same who after having
introduced evil into the world, began to cover it with the thick
darkness of error and vice; the same who for many centuries made
themselves worshiped as gods and who reigned completely over the
peoples of antiquity; the same, finally, who still exert a tyrannical
influence in idolatrous regions, fostering disorder and scandal even
in the heart of Christian organizations.
       “In order for us to understand all the resources available to
them in their service of evil, we need only to note that they lost
nothing of the prodigious faculties that are the natural prerogative
of the angelic nature. Of course, the future and the natural order,
especially, contain mysteries that God has reserved and which
they cannot ascertain, but their intelligence is far superior to
ours, for they perceive both cause and effect in a flash. This
perception enables them to predict future events that escape our
conjectures. Distance and diversity of place disappear before their
agility. Quicker than lightning and faster than thought, they can
instantaneously be at any point on the globe, and from far off can
describe events at the same time in which they occur.
       “The general laws through which God rules and controls
the universe are not accessible to them; they cannot derogate
from them and, consequently, predict or perform true miracles.
However, within certain limits they possess the art of imitating
and falsifying the divine works. They know which phenomena
result from the combinations of various elements and they can
predict with certainty the phenomena that occur naturally, as well
as those they themselves can cause; hence the numerous oracles, the


                                137

                       Part One - Chapter IX


extraordinary prophecies, whose memories have been preserved in
sacred and profane books, serving as the basis and nourishment for
all sorts of superstition.
       “Their simple and immaterial substance hides them from our
sight. They remain beside us without our seeing them; they touch
our soul without touching our ears. Believing that we are obeying
our own thoughts, we are nevertheless often under their sinister
influence. On the other hand, our own dispositions are known to
them by the impressions they make on us and they usually attack
us at our weakest point. In order to more surely seduce us, they
normally use lures and suggestions according to our inclinations.
They modify their action according to the circumstances and the
characteristic traits of each individual temperament. However,
their favorite weapons are hypocrisy and lies.”
       17. “Punishment,” it is said, “follows them everywhere;
they have neither peace nor rest.” This assertion in no way
destroys our observation regarding the respite of those who are
not in hell, a respite all the more unjustifiable because, being
outside of it, they do even greater evil. Of course, they are not
happy like the good angels, but doesn’t the freedom they do
enjoy account for anything at all? Although they do not enjoy
the moral happiness that virtue bestows, they are undeniably less
unhappy than their accomplices in the flames of hell. Moreover,
for the malicious, there is a certain pleasure in committing evil
with full liberty. Ask the criminal which he would prefer: to
remain in prison or to run through the fields, committing his
crimes as he pleases. It is exactly the same situation.
       It was also stated that remorse pursues them without
respite or pity. However, we forget that remorse is the immediate
precursor to repentance, if not repentance itself. It was stated:
“Having become perverse, they do not want to cease being so and
will be so forever.” However, if they persist in being perverse, it


                               138

                              Demons


is because they are not remorseful; on the other hand, if they had
the least bit of regret, they would cease to practice evil and would
beg for forgiveness. Thus, remorse is not a punishment for them.
       18. “After they sinned, they became what men are after
death. The rehabilitation of those who fell therefore became
impossible.” Where did such impossibility come from? We do not
understand how it can be the result of their similarity to human
beings after death, a proposition that is ambiguous at best. Does
such impossibility come from their own will or from the divine
will? If the former, such denotes extreme perversity, a complete
hardening in evil; consequently, we cannot comprehend how
such profoundly perverse beings could have ever been angels
of virtue, or how throughout the infinite time that they spent
among the angels, they did not allow a single sign of their natural
malevolence to appear; if the latter, we comprehend even less
how, as a punishment, God could inflict the impossibility of
a return to goodness after the very first wrong. The Gospels
mention nothing of the sort.
       19. “Their loss” – it is added – “is thus irreparable and
they remain in their pride before God.” But why shouldn’t they
remain in such pride since it would be futile for them to repent?
If they had the hope of rehabilitation, whatever its price might
be, goodness would have a purpose for them, whereas in this
way it means nothing. If they persevere in evil, it is because the
door of hope has been locked against them. But why would God
lock the door? In order to avenge the offense resulting from their
insubordination. Thus, in order to satisfy divine resentment
against a few guilty angels, God wants not only to see them suffer,
but also to see them practice evil instead of good in order to
induce human beings to evil and cast them into eternal perdition,
when, by a simple act of clemency, such a great disaster could be
avoided, a disaster foreseen from all eternity!


                                139

                         Part One - Chapter IX


       Would such an act of clemency perchance be a pure and
simple act of grace that could be twisted into an encouragement to
do evil? No, it would be a conditional forgiveness that depended
on a sincere return to the good. Instead of offering a word of hope
and mercy, God is portrayed as having said: Let all humankind
perish rather than my vengeance! And with such a doctrine, people
still wonder why there are disbelievers and atheists! Is this the way
Jesus portrayed his Father to us? Would he who gave us the express
law of the forgetfulness and forgiveness of offenses, who told us to
repay evil with good, and who prescribed loving our enemies as
the first of the virtues that would lead us to heaven, want people to
thereby be better, more just, more indulgent than God?

          Demons according to Spiritism
       20. According to Spiritism, neither angels nor demons are
separate entities; all intelligent beings have been created endowed
with one and the same nature. United to physical bodies, these
beings make up the humankind populating the earth and other
inhabitable spheres. Once freed from the body, they make up
the spirit world or the world of the spirits populating space. God
created them perfectible, with perfection as their goal along with its
consequential happiness; however, God did not create them perfect.
God willed for them to reach perfection through their own efforts
so that the merit would truly be their own. From the moment of
their creation, beings evolve, whether in the incarnate or spirit
state. After reaching the apogee, they become pure spirits or angels
(according to the common expression) so that, from the intelligent
being’s embryonic state to its angelic state, there is an uninterrupted
chain wherein each link represents a degree of progress.
       Consequently, there are spirits at every degree of moral
and intellectual evolution, according to their top, middle or low

                                 140

                                              Demons


position on the scale of progress. At every degree, therefore, there
is ignorance and knowledge, goodness and evil. Within the lowest
order50 there are spirits who still have a profound propensity to evil
and who take pleasure in it. These may be called demons, if one so
wishes, for they are capable of all the wiles attributed to that word.
If Spiritism does not label them as such, it is because it leads to the
idea of a creation apart from humankind, one composed of beings
with an essentially wicked nature, eternally dedicated to evil and
incapable of any progress toward the good.
       21. According to Church doctrine, the demons were
created good but became evil through their disobedience: they
are fallen angels; they are angels who at first were placed by God
at the apex of the scale, but who then fell from it. According to
Spiritism, demons are as-yet imperfect spirits who are susceptible
to regeneration and although located at the bottom of the scale
they will nevertheless ascend it.
       Spirits who out of apathy, negligence, stubbornness or ill-will
persist in remaining within the lower orders for a long time suffer
the consequences of their attitude, and their habit of evil renders it
difficult for them to leave it behind. However, at some point they
grow weary of such a dolorous life and its respective consequences.
It is thus that they compare their own situation to that of good
spirits and they understand that their interest lies in what is good;
hence, they try to better themselves, but through a spontaneous
act of their will and without the least coercion. They are subject to
the law of progress due to their aptitude for progress, but they are not
forced to progress against their will. God constantly provides them
with the means; however, they are free to accept such means or not.
If progress were obligatory, there would be no merit in it, and God
wills for all of us to enjoy the merit of our deeds. God does not
place anyone at the top of the scale out of privilege, but that spot

is open to all and they only reach it at the cost of their own effort.
The most highly evolved angels have earned their degree as all the
others will – by traversing the course common to all.
       22. After arriving at a certain degree of purity, spirits are
given missions in accordance with their progress, performing all
those attributed to angels of the various hierarchies. Since God
has created throughout all eternity, it follows that throughout all
eternity there have been angels ready to meet the needs of universal
governance. In this way, only one species of intelligent being,
abiding by the law of progress, is enough. Finally, this unity of
creation, allied with the idea that all have the same starting point
and the same road to traverse, along with the idea that they progress
through self-merit, corresponds more to God’s justice than the
creation of different species who are favored by differing degrees of
natural endowments, which would imply various other privileges.
       23. By not accepting the law of progress but nevertheless
admitting beings of various degrees, the common doctrine about
the nature of angels, demons and souls concludes that they are
the product of various special creations. It thus makes God into
a biased Father, granting everything to only a few of his children
while imposing the harshest labor on the others. It is no wonder
that for a long time people did not find such preferences shocking,
because they themselves employed them regarding their own
children by establishing rights of primogenitor and other privileges
of birth. Could such people believe they were any more wrong than
God? Today, however, the circle of ideas has widened: people see
more clearly and have more precise notions of justice. They desire
it for themselves, and if such justice is not always to be found on
the earth, they hope at least to find it in heaven. That is why every
doctrine wherein the divine justice is not displayed in its greatest
purity is repugnant to their reason.

         The Intervention of
         Demons in Modern
          Communications
       1. Modern spirit phenomena have attracted attention to
incidents analogous to those that have occurred in all ages, and
regarding them history has never been more carefully scrutinized
than it has been of late. Because of the similarity of their effects,
a common cause may thus be inferred. As always happens with
respect to extraordinary phenomena not immediately grasped by
reason, ignorance has always assigned a supernatural cause to them,
and superstition has exaggerated this ignorance by adding absurd
beliefs about them. This has led to a multitude of legends which for
the most part are an amalgam of little truth and much error.
       2. The long-prevailing doctrines about the Devil have
exaggerated his powers to such a degree that they have eclipsed
God’s, so to speak. That is why everything that surpasses human
power is attributed to the Devil. The hand of Satan appears
everywhere. The best things and the most useful discoveries –
especially those that might uproot people’s ignorance and widen
the circle of their ideas – have often been viewed as works of the
Devil. The spirit phenomena of our day, which have increased
considerably and have been better observed with the aid of reason


                                143

                         Part One - Chapter X


and scientific data, have in fact confirmed the intervention of
concealed intelligences. However, these intelligences always act
within the limits of natural law, and in their action they reveal a
new force and new laws that had formerly been unknown. Hence,
the issue is reduced to knowing the order of things to which these
intelligences belong.
       While there were only imprecise or theoretical ideas about
the spirit world, people could continue to be mistaken about it.
Today, however, since strict observation and experimental studies
have shed light on the nature of spirits, their origin and destiny,
their role in the universe and their way of acting, the issue has been
resolved by the facts. We now know that spirits are the souls of
those who have lived on the earth. We also know that the various
categories of good and evil spirits are not composed of different
species of beings, but only represent the same beings at different
degrees of advancement. Depending on the position they occupy
in virtue of their intellectual and moral development, the beings
who manifest display the profoundest contrasts. Nevertheless, this
does not prevent them from having arisen from the same great
human family, which, after all, includes primitives, barbarians and
civilized peoples.
       3. Regarding this point – like so many others – the Church
has maintained its old beliefs with respect to demons. It states: “We
have principles that have not varied for over eighteen centuries
because they are immutable.” Its error is precisely in not taking
into account the progress of ideas and in believing that God is not
wise enough to provide revelation to human beings according to
the development of their minds, but instead speaks to advanced
humans in the same language used for primitives. If humankind
progresses while religion remains entrenched in its old errors with
regards to both spiritual and scientific matters, the time will come
when religion will be supplanted by disbelief.

              The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


       4. Following is how the Church explains the exclusive
intervention of demons in modern spirit manifestations51:
       “In their outside interventions, demons disguise their
presence in such a way as to lay suspicions aside. Always clever
and treacherous, they lure men into their trap before imposing the
chains of oppression and servitude upon them. Here they arouse
their curiosity in phenomena and childish entertainment; there
they awaken their wonder and subjugate them with the spell of the
extraordinary. If the supernatural nature of their acts becomes clear
and their power is unmasked, they then allay and ease their victims’
apprehension by asking for their trust and by inviting familiarity.
Sometimes, they pass themselves off as divinities and good spirits;
at other times, they take on names and even the traits of the dead
who have left their memory among the living. With the help of
these frauds – worthy of the ancient serpent – they speak and are
listened to; they dogmatize and are believed; they mix truths in
with their lies and propagate error behind every form. This is the
meaning of the supposed revelations from beyond the grave, and
to achieve this result, wood and stone, forest and fountain, idol
sanctuaries, table legs and the hands of children become oracles.
That is the reason why the fortune teller prophesies in a state of
delirium and why the ignorant person all of a sudden becomes
a scientist during some sort of mysterious sleep. To deceive and
pervert: that has been everywhere and at all times the final objective
of such strange manifestations.
       “The surprising results of these observances and practices –
for the most part odd and ridiculous acts – cannot come from
their intrinsic virtue or any order established by God, but can
only be attributed to the concourse of occult powers. Such are,
in particular, the extraordinary phenomena occurring nowadays

through the apparently inoffensive incidents of magnetism as
well as those of talking tables. By means of modern magic, we see
among us the evocations and oracles, consultations, healings and
tricks that used to adorn idolatrous temples and sibylline caves.
Like yesterday, they command wood and it obeys; they ask and
it responds in all sorts of languages and on all kinds of subjects.
We find ourselves in the presence of invisible beings who usurp
the names of the dead, and whose pretentious revelations bear the
stamp of contradiction and falsehood. Vaporous forms without
consistency suddenly appear and show themselves to be endowed
with super-human power.
       “Who are the secret agents behind these phenomena, the
true actors of these inexplicable scenes? Angels would not accept
such unworthy roles, nor lend themselves to any caprice of
vain curiosity. The souls of the dead, whom God forbids being
consulted, remain in the place to which justice has assigned
them and cannot be put at the orders of the living without God’s
permission. Therefore, the mysterious beings who answer the first
call of the heretic or the impious as well as the faithful, the criminal
as well as the innocent, are sent neither by God nor apostles of
truth and salvation, but rather by agents of error and hell. In spite
of the care with which they hide behind the most venerable names,
they betray themselves in the emptiness of their doctrines, the
baseness of their acts and the incoherence of their words. They
seek to do away with religious symbols, the dogmas of original
sin, the resurrection of the body and eternal punishment, as well
as all divine revelation, in order to deprive the Church’s laws of
their true sanction and break down all the barriers to vice. If their
suggestions could prevail, they would end up forming a religion
that was appropriate for use by socialists and by all those who
find the idea of duty and conscience irksome. The disbelief of our
time has prepared the way. By a sincere dedication to the Catholic


                                  146

        The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


faith, may all Christian peoples escape the danger of this new and
frightening invasion!”
       5. This entire theory derives from the principle that angels
and demons are beings distinct from human souls, which are
the product of a special creation inferior even to the demons in
intelligence, knowledge and every faculty. Its conclusion is that
both ancient and modern manifestations of spirits have occurred
exclusively as a result of the intervention of evil angels.
       The possibility of souls communicating with the living is
an issue of fact, the result of observation and experimentation
which we cannot go into at this time. However, let us accept as a
hypothesis the above-cited doctrine and see if it doesn’t fall apart
under its own arguments.
       6. Of the Church’s three categories of angels, one exclusively
occupies itself with heaven, another with the universe’s governance
and the third is in charge of the earth. It is in this third category
where the angels in charge of protecting each individual may be
found. Only a portion of the angels of this category took part in
the revolt and were transformed into demons. If God has allowed
them to lead humans into perdition by suggestions of every kind
and through ostensive manifestations, then why – if God is truly
supremely just and good – has God given them the immense
power to enjoy a freedom that they put to such pernicious use,
without also allowing good angels to counterbalance it with similar
manifestations intended for a good purpose? Admitting that God
had given good and evil beings equal power – which would be an
enormous favor on behalf of the latter – at least then people would
have the freedom to choose between the two. However, in giving
the evil angels a monopoly on temptation, with the ability to
simulate what is good in order to fool people and to seduce them
more effectively, such would be a genuine trap set up for people’s
weakness, inexperience and good faith. What is more, it would


                                147

                          Part One - Chapter X


be to presume an abuse of trust on God’s part. Reason refuses to
accept such bias in favor of evil. Let us take a look at the facts.
        7. Demons, according to the Church, have been granted
transcendent faculties – they have lost none of their angel nature.
They possess knowledge, discernment, foresight and the clairvoyance
of the angels, but additionally a high degree of shrewdness, cunning
and artifice. Their objective is to lead humans away from the good
and especially to keep them from God in order to drag them down
into hell, for which they are purveyors and recruiters.
        We can understand that they direct their efforts toward those
who are on the morally upright path, and who would be otherwise
lost to them if they persisted on this path. We might even understand
their seduction through a simulation of the good in order to draw
them into their nets. However, what is incomprehensible is that
they in fact direct their efforts toward those who should already
belong to them in body and soul and they do so in order to guide
them to God and the good! Who could be more in the grip of
demons than those who deny and blaspheme God, who immerse
themselves in vice and the turmoil of the passions? Aren’t they
already on their way to hell? Having secured their prey, why would
these supposed demons exhort them to pray to God, to submit
to the divine will and to renounce evil? Why would they hold up
before their prey the delightful life of good spirits and paint such
a horrible picture of what is in store for evil ones? Who has ever
seen retailers praise the merchandise of their competitors to the
detriment of their own, recommending their clients to them? Who
has ever seen a military recruiter deprecate military life and praise
the ease of civilian life? Would they tell their recruits that they will
have a life of fatigue and privation, that there is a ten to one chance
in favor of their being killed or at least of losing an arm or a leg?
        Nevertheless, this is the foolish role attributed to demons, for
it is a well-known fact that as a result of the teachings emanating


                                  148

        The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


from the invisible world we see disbelievers return to God every
day and pray with a fervor they had never had before, and we see
vicious individuals struggle ardently to better themselves. Thus, to
attribute such a ruse to the Devil is to confer on him the diploma
of a true simpleton. And since we are not dealing with a simple
supposition but an experiential fact against which there is no
argument, we must conclude that the Devil is either completely
inept or he is not as cunning and evil as imagined. Consequently,
he is not as fearful as previously thought, since he is working
against his own interests – or else he is not at all the one behind
every manifestation.
      8. “They inscribe error under all sorts of forms, and in
order to achieve this result wood, stone, forests, fountains, idol
sanctuaries, table legs and the hands of children become oracles.”
      According to this, what would be the value ascribed to these
words from the Scriptures: “I will pour out my spirit on all flesh.
Your sons and daughters shall prophesy; your young people shall
have visions and your old people shall dream dreams. In those
days, I shall pour out my spirit on all my servants and they shall
prophesy” (Acts 2:17,18). Don’t these words contain a prophecy of
the mediumship of our day, and which is being granted to all sorts
of individuals, even to children? Was such a faculty condemned by
the apostles? No. They pronounced it as a divine grace and not as
a work of the Devil. Are today’s theologians endowed with more
knowledge concerning this matter than the apostles? Shouldn’t
they instead see the hand of God in the fulfillment of these words?
       9. “By means of modern magic we see among us the
evocations, oracles, consultations, healings and trickery that used
to adorn idolatrous temples and sibylline caves.”
       Where do we see practices of magic in spirit evocations?
There was a time when people believed in the efficacy of these
practices, but today they are seen as foolish. No one believes in


                                149

                           Part One - Chapter X


them and Spiritism condemns them. At the time when magic
flourished, knowledge about the nature of spirits was highly
imperfect and they were regarded as having been endowed with
super-human power. They were evoked to obtain the favors of luck
and fortune, to discover hidden treasure, to reveal the future or to
provide philters52 – even at the cost of one’s soul. With its symbols,
formulas and cabalistic practices, magic was claimed to be capable
of revealing secrets for performing wonders and coercing spirits
to remain at the orders of humans to satisfy their desires. Today,
we know that spirits are merely the souls of the dead and we only
evoke them to receive counsel from the good ones, to moralize the
imperfect ones and to continue our relationships with our loved
ones. Here is what Spiritism has to say on the matter:
       10. - There are no means available for coercing a spirit to
come against its will. If it is morally equal to or above you, you
have no authority over it whatsoever. If it is morally beneath you,
you can only act upon it if it is for its own good because in that case
other spirits will help you. (The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXV)
       - Whenever we want to address serious spirits, the most
essential of all attitudes for evoking them is concentration. If
we have faith and the desire for the good, we make ourselves more
capable of evoking higher order spirits. By lifting up our soul for a
few moments of concentration at the time we evoke good spirits,
we identify ourselves with them and thus predispose them to come
to us. (The Medium’ Book, chap. XXV)
       - No object, medallion or talisman has the ability to attract
or repel spirits; matter per se has no effect on them. A good spirit
would never advise such absurdities. A talisman’s virtue can only
exist in the mind of the one who believes in it. (The Mediums’
Book, chap. XXV)

       - There are no sacramental formulas for evoking spirits.
Whoever might claim to have established such a formula could
be accused of charlatanism, since form means nothing to spirits.
However, an evocation must always be made in God’ name. (The
Mediums’ Book, chap. XVII)
       - Spirits who set dates for communications in gloomy places
at inconvenient hours are those who have fun at the expense of
whoever will listen to them. It is always futile and often dangerous
to give in to such suggestions; futile because absolutely nothing is
gained except deception, and dangerous not because of what such
spirits might do, but because of the influence that such incidents
can exert upon weak minds. (The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXV)
       - There are no specially propitious days or times for evocations;
like everything else material, such is completely meaningless to
spirits. Besides, belief in these things is mere superstition. The most
favorable times are those when the evoker can be least preoccupied
with his or her habitual concerns, or when his or her body and
spirit feel most serene. (The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXV)
       - Malevolent critics enjoy representing spirit communications
as surrounded by the foolish and superstitious practices of magic
and necromancy. If those who speak about Spiritism without
understanding it would endeavor to study it, they would spare
themselves much imaginative work and avoid allegations that
could serve only to demonstrate their ignorance or ill-will. For
the edification of individuals foreign to the science53, we would
state that there are no specially propitious days, hours or places
for evoking spirits, nor are there any formulas or sacramental
or cabalistic words required. No preparation or initiation is
necessary. The use of any symbol or material object, whether to
attract or repel them, has no effect – thought alone is sufficient.
53
     “Spiritism is the new science that has come to reveal to mankind, by means of irrefutable
     proofs, the existence and nature of the spiritual world and its relationship with the physical
     world.” Allan Kardec, The Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. 1, Item 5. (emphasis added) – Tr.

Finally, mediums receive their communications without leaving
the normal state, as simply and naturally as if they were dictated
by a living person. Only charlatanism could display eccentric
mannerisms and add ridiculous accessories to such moments.
(What is Spiritism? chap. II, no. 49)
       - In principle, the future must remain hidden from
humankind; only in rare and exceptional cases does God allow
it to be revealed. If people knew the future, they would certainly
neglect the present and would not act with the same freedom,
since they would be dominated by the thought that if such and
such must happen, it would do no good to be concerned about
it; on the other hand, they might try to find a way to prevent it.
God has willed it to be this way so that all may contribute to the
accomplishment of things, even to that which humankind would
want to avoid. Nevertheless, God permits the future to be revealed
whenever the foreknowledge of an event would not hinder but
facilitate the event’s accomplishment by leading persons to act
favorably and not contrarily. (The Spirits’ Book, pt. 3, chap. X)
       - Spirits do not ostensibly guide scientific research or
discoveries. Science is the work of genius and can only be acquired
through labor because that is how humankind evolves. What merit
would there be if in order to know about something, all we had
to do was ask spirits? At that price, any simpleton could become
knowledgeable. The same applies regarding the inventions and
discoveries of industry.
       When the time for particular discoveries arrives, the spirits
in charge of directing their implementation seek out individuals
who are capable of succeeding at them. They inspire them with
the necessary ideas so as to leave them all the merit, for the
individuals themselves must develop and put them into effect.
Such has been the case with all great works of the human mind.
Spirits leave every individual within his or her own realm: those


                                152

        The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


who are only capable of tilling the soil are not made depositories
of the secrets of God; nevertheless, spirits can dredge up from
obscurity those who show themselves capable of assisting the divine
plan. Consequently, do not allow yourselves to be led by curiosity
or ambition onto a path which is not the objective of Spiritism,
and which would lead you into the most foolish deceptions. (The
Mediums’ Book, chap. XXVI)
       - Spirits do not lead anyone to the discovery of hidden
treasure. High order spirits are not concerned about such things
and only deceitful spirits would point out treasures that most of
the time do not even exist or indicate sites that are diametrically
opposite those where the treasures really are. Nonetheless, this has
its usefulness in that it shows that true fortune resides in labor.
Whenever Providence has destined someone for hidden riches,
that person will come upon them naturally and not otherwise.
(The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXVI)
       - By enlightening us about the properties of the fluids – the
agents and means of action for the invisible world and comprising
one of the forces and powers of nature – Spiritism provides us
the key to innumerable phenomena that have been unexplainable
and which are inexplicable by any other means, and which in the
past used to be regarded as miracles. Like magnetism, Spiritism
reveals a law, if not unknown, at least poorly understood, that is,
a law whose effects we know about because they have occurred
throughout history. It is ignorance of this law that gave rise to
superstition in the first place. Once the law was identified,
however, the extraordinary disappeared and the phenomena
entered the order of natural events. That is why spirits do not
any more perform miracles by making tables turn or the dead
to write than physicians perform miracles by reviving a dying
person, or physicists by causing lightening bolts. Whoever claims
to perform miracles through Spiritism would either be ignorant of


                                153

                                    Part One - Chapter X


the science54 or would have an interest in deceiving others. (The
Mediums’ Book, chap. II)
       - Some people have a very wrong idea about evocations.
There are those who think they consist in making the dead
return from the grave in their funeral garb. Only in novels, in
supernatural ghost stories and on stage do we see the fleshless dead
come from the grave draped in sheets and rattling their bones.
Spiritism, which has never performed miracles, does not produce
this kind or any other, and it has never revived a dead body. When
the body is buried, it remains there forever, but the fluidic and
intelligent spirit being is not buried with its dense envelope. It
begins to separate from the body at the instant of death, and once
this separation takes place there is no longer anything in common
between them. (What is Spiritism? chap. II, no. 48)
       11. We have dwelled on the above statements in order to
show that the principles of Spiritism have no relation whatsoever
with those of magic. In Spiritism, spirits are not at the orders
of humans; there are no means of coercing them; no symbols
or cabalistic formulas; no treasure discoveries or procedures for
becoming rich; no miracles or wonders, divinization or fantastical
apparitions; nothing, finally, that comprises the purpose and
essential elements of magic. Spiritism not only repudiates such
things but demonstrates their impossibility and ineffectiveness.
Thus, there is no analogy between the purposes and means of
magic and those of Spiritism; only ignorance and bad faith could
confuse the two. Consequently, since Spiritist principles have
nothing secret about them because they are formulated in clear
terms without any possibility of mistake, such misunderstanding
cannot prevail.
       As for healings, admitted as real in the pastoral letter cited
above, that example was badly chosen as a way to discourage

relationships with spirits. In fact, healings are one of the benefits that
impress people most and which all can appreciate. Few people will
be disposed to renounce them – especially after having exhausted
all other resources – from fear of being healed by the Devil. On the
contrary, there will even be those who will say that if the Devil can
heal them, then he is capable of good deeds after all.55
       12. “What are the secret agents of such phenomena, the true
authors of such inexplicable scenes? Angels would not agree to
perform such unworthy functions and would not lend themselves
to the caprices of vain curiosity.”
       The pastoral’s author is referring to the physical
manifestations of spirits. Among them there are obviously those
that would not be worthy of highly evolved spirits. If by the word
angels we are to understand to mean pure spirits or high order spirits,
then his assertion is in precise keeping with what Spiritism has to
say on the matter. However, one cannot place intelligent written,
spoken, auditory communications – or communications via any
other means – on the same level, because these communications
are no less worthy of good spirits than they would be of the most
imminent individuals on earth; nor are apparitions, healings and
a huge number of others that the scriptures profusely cite as being
produced by angels and saints. Thus, if angels and saints produced
similar phenomena yesteryear, why wouldn’t they do so today?
Nowadays, why would identical phenomena be deemed as the
work of the Devil in the hands of some, while deemed as holy
miracles in the hands of others? Holding to such a thesis is to
abandon all logic.
       The author of the pastoral letter errs in stating that the
phenomena are inexplicable. On the contrary, today they are

     In wanting to persuade people who have been healed by spirits that it was the work of the
     Devil, the Church has alienated a large number of them who otherwise would have never
     considered leaving. – Auth.

perfectly explicable and that is why they are no longer viewed
as miraculous or supernatural. Even if they were to still remain
inexplicable, it would be no more logical to attribute them to the
Devil than it was in the past to attribute to the Devil all the natural
phenomena that could not be comprehended.
        By the expression unworthy functions we must understand it
to mean any ridiculous or evil role. However, we cannot qualify
as such the acts of spirits who practice the good and lead people
to God and to virtue. Spiritism expressly states that unworthy
functions are not the attributes of highly evolved spirits, as the
following precepts demonstrate:
        13. A spirit’s category is recognized by its language. Those
who are truly good and of a high order always express themselves
in dignified, noble and logical language that is devoid of any
contradiction; it resounds with wisdom, benevolence, modesty and
the purest morals. It is concise and without useless redundancy.
Among low order spirits, who are ignorant or proud, the emptiness
of their ideas is always compensated for by an abundance of words.
Every implicitly erroneous thought, every maxim contrary to
sane morals, every absurd counsel, every crude, trivial or simply
frivolous expression, any sign of malevolence, presumptuousness
or arrogance are incontestable indications of a little-evolved spirit.
        – High order spirits only concern themselves with intelligent
communications aimed at our instruction. Physical or purely
material manifestations are most commonly entrusted to low
order spirits – normally designated as rapping spirits – for the same
reason that among us gymnastics are performed by tumblers and
not by scholars. It would be absurd to suppose that a spirit, even
a little-evolved one, would enjoy ostentation (see What is Spiritism?

and evil spirits)

         The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


       What person of good faith could possibly see in these precepts
any unworthy function attributed to high order spirits? Spiritism
not only does not group all spirits together, but as far as attributing
intelligence to demons – an intelligence equal to that of the
angels – Spiritism has verified by observing the phenomena that,
on the contrary, low order spirits are ignorant to various degrees,
their moral horizon is narrow, and their astuteness is limited. They
often hold an erroneous and incomplete idea about things and are
incapable of resolving certain issues, and, consequently, of doing
all the things attributed to demons.
       14. “The souls of the dead, whom God prohibits to be
evoked, remain in the place to which justice has assigned them,
and without his permission they cannot place themselves at the
disposition of the living.”
       Spiritism also says that spirits cannot manifest without
God’s permission, but it is even stricter, for it states that it does
not accept the manifestation of any spirit – good or bad – without
God’s permission. The Church, on the other hand, does not hold
this to be the case with demons. Demons are exempt from such
permission. Spiritism goes even further because it affirms that in
spite of such permission, whenever spirits answer the call of the
living, they still do not place themselves at their disposal.
       Does a spirit who is evoked come voluntarily, or is it
coerced into manifesting itself? It obeys the will of God. This
means that it obeys the general law governing the universe. It
thus judges the usefulness of manifesting, and therein lies its
free will. A high order spirit always answers whenever it is called
for a useful reason, and only refuses to respond when evoked by
frivolous persons who treat the manifestation as an amusement.
(The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXV)
       – Can a spirit who is evoked refuse to come? Absolutely. If
not, what would become of its free will? Do you yourselves believe


                                 157

                        Part One - Chapter X


that all the beings of the universe are at your orders? Do you
yourselves feel obligated to respond to all who call you by name?
When I say that it can refuse, I mean at the order of the evoker,
for a low order spirit might be obligated by a high order one to
manifest. (The Mediums’ Book, chap. XXV)
       Spiritists are so convinced of not having any direct power
over spirits and of not being able to obtain anything without God’s
permission that when they call a spirit they say, I pray to Almighty
God to allow a good spirit to communicate with me; I also pray to
my guardian angel to assist me and keep evil spirits away. And when
calling to a particular spirit, they say, I pray to Almighty God to
allow the spirit of so-and-so to communicate with me. (The Mediums’
Book, chap XVII, no. 203)
       15. The accusations formulated by the Church against
evocations do not therefore apply to Spiritism, since they refer
mainly to the practices of magic, with which Spiritism has nothing
in common. Spiritism condemns such practices as much as the
Church does, while at the same time it does not confer a role on
high order spirits unworthy of them, nor does it ask anything or
obtain anything without God’s permission.
       Of course, there may be some who abuse evocations, who
make a game of them, who denature their providential purpose
in order to advance their own personal interests, or who, out of
ignorance, frivolousness, pride or ambition, deviate from the
true principles of the Doctrine. True Spiritism, serious Spiritism,
however, disowns them, just as true religion disowns false believers
and the excesses of fanaticism. Therefore, it is neither logical nor
reasonable to impute to Spiritism abuses that it itself condemns, or
the errors of those who do not understand it. Before formulating
any kind of accusation, one must know if it is justified. Hence,
we will state: the Church’s denunciation falls upon charlatans and
speculators, on the practitioners of magic and sorcery – and with


                                158

         The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


good reason. Whenever religious or skeptic criticism categorizes
abuses and stigmatizes charlatanism, it is doing nothing more than
restoring the purity of the sane doctrine, which in turn helps to
root out evil elements and thereby facilitates our task. The error
of criticism is in confusing good and evil, which often occurs
through the bad faith of some and through the ignorance of many.
However, the distinction that such criticism fails to make, others
do make. In any event, denunciation applied to evil, with which
any sincere Spiritist would concur, cannot affect the Doctrine.
       16. “Therefore, the mysterious beings who answer the first
call of the heretic or the impious as well as the faithful, the criminal
as well as the innocent, are sent neither by God nor apostles of
truth and salvation, but rather by agents of error and hell.”
       Thus, God does not allow good spirits to come to the
heretic, the impious person or the criminal in order to draw them
from error and save them from eternal perdition! God sends only
agents of hell to drive them deeper into the mire! At the same time,
God sends only evil beings to the innocent in order to pervert
them! Amongst all the angels – those privileged creatures of God –
isn’t there one being sufficiently compassionate who might come
to the aid of lost souls!? Then what good are the shining qualities
displayed by these beings if such qualities are only for their own
personal enjoyment? Can they really be good angels if, immersed
in the delights of contemplation, they see souls on their way to hell
but do nothing to divert them from it? But isn’t that precisely the
picture of the selfish wealthy individual who possesses everything
with profusion but leaves the beggar to die of hunger at his or her
door? Isn’t that selfishness erected as a virtue and set at the very feet
of the Eternal One?
       You marvel that good spirits might help the heretic and the
impious person. Thus you forget the words of Christ, “It is not
the one who is thoroughly healthy who needs a doctor!” Can’t


                                  159

                         Part One - Chapter X


you see things from a higher perspective than the Pharisees in
Jesus’ day? And if you yourself were called upon by a disbeliever,
would you refuse to show him or her the moral path? Well then,
good spirits do what you yourself would do – they approach the
impious in order to give them wise counsel. Instead of condemning
communications from beyond the grave, praise the decrees of God
and marvel at the Divine in its omnipotence and infinite goodness.
       17. It is stated that there are guardian angels, but when
they cannot make themselves listened to through the mysterious
voice of conscience or through inspiration, why couldn’t they
use means which are more direct and physical, and which are
capable of impressing the senses if such means exist? Moreover,
if everything comes from God and nothing occurs without God’s
permission, is it possible that God avails only evil spirits of such
means while refusing good spirits the right to make use of them?
If that were the case, we would have to admit that God furnishes
more power to the Devil to lead humans to their ruin than to
guardian angels to save them.
       Well then, what guardian angels cannot do themselves –
according to the Church – demons do for them. By means of
supposedly “infernal” spirit communications, demons lead to God
those who have denied God, and to the good those who have been
steeped in evil. These “demons” present us with the strange spectacle
of millions of people who have come to believe in God through
the power of the Devil after the Church showed itself powerless
to convert them. People who had never prayed before now pray
fervently thanks to the instructions of these demons! How many
proud, selfish and immoral persons have become humble, charitable
and moral! And yet they say that it is the work of the Devil! If that
were the case, it is obvious that the Devil has rendered a better
service and protection to such persons than the angels themselves
have. However, one would have to have a very poor opinion of


                                 160

         The Intervention of Demons in Modern Communications


human judgment in our day and age to believe that people blindly
accept such ideas. A religion that makes such a doctrine one of its
cornerstones; a religion that declares that it would be destroyed at its
very foundations if demons, hell, eternal punishment and its idea of
an unjust God were removed, is a religion that is committing suicide.
       18. It is said that God sent Christ to save humankind,
thereby proving God’s love. But then how could God have left
them without protection afterwards? Undoubtedly, Christ was the
divine Messiah, sent to teach humankind the truth and show them
a better way. However, count how many people after his coming
have been able to hear his words, how many have died and how
many will die without having known them, and finally how many
of those who have known them have actually practiced them!
Additionally, why wouldn’t God, who always desires the salvation
of God’s creatures, send other messengers, who, upon coming to
earth and going into the humblest places among the great and
small, the learned and ignorant, disbelievers and believers, would
teach the truth to those who have not heard the divine word? Why
wouldn’t God send such messengers in order to make the word
comprehensible to those who do not understand it, overcoming
through their direct and multiple teaching the insufficiency of the
attempt at spreading the Gospel, thereby hastening the advent of
the kingdom of God? But when in following Jesus’ example these
messengers come in innumerable hosts to open the eyes of the
blind, to convert the impious, to heal the sick and to console the
afflicted, the Church rejects them, denies the good they do and
calls them demons! Such was the Pharisees’ language regarding
Christ. They also said that he did good through the power of the
Devil! How did he respond? “You recognize a tree by its fruit: a
bad tree cannot produce good fruit.”
       To the Pharisees, Jesus’ fruit was bad because he came to
destroy abuse and proclaim the freedom that would ruin their


                                  161

                         Part One - Chapter X


authority. If he had come to flatter their pride, approve their corrupt
practices and uphold their power, he would have been received as
the hoped-for Messiah of the Jews. However, Christ was alone, poor
and frail, and they condemned him to death, hoping to extinguish
his word – but his word survived because it was divine. It spread
very slowly, however, and after eighteen centuries it is only known
by a tenth of humankind, and there have been many schisms even
among his disciples. It is thus out of divine mercy that God sent the
Spirits to confirm the holy word of Jesus, to complete it, to place it
within reach of all, and to spread it throughout the earth. However,
the Spirits have not incarnated in only one man, whose voice would
have limited reach; they are innumerable; they go everywhere and
no one can stop them. Their teaching is spreading with the speed
of lightning because they speak to the heart and reason, and so they
are understood even by the most humble.
        19. “Isn’t it unworthy of heavenly messengers,” the Church
asks, “to transmit their teachings by such lowly means as talking
tables? Isn’t it an insult to suppose that they entertain themselves
with trivialities, leaving their dwelling place of light to put
themselves at the disposition of the first person to come along?”
        Didn’t Jesus leave the dwelling of his Father to be born in
a stable? Where has it been said that Spiritism attributes trivial
practices to high order spirits? On the contrary, Spiritism affirms
just the opposite; trivial phenomena are only produced by trivial
spirits. Nonetheless, such triviality has struck many minds by
proving the existence of the spirit world and demonstrating that
that world is much different than the picture that had been painted
of it. It was just the beginning and it was simple, like everything
else at the beginning. But the tree that arises from a small seed later
extends its branches over a great area. Who would have thought
that the lowly manger of Bethlehem would give rise to the word
that would transform the world?

       Yes! Christ is the divine Messiah; yes! his word is the truth;
yes! the religion founded upon that word will be unshakable, but
only on condition that its most sublime teachings are followed and
practiced and that the just and good God whom Christ introduced
to us is not made into a biased, vengeful and cruel one.

                          CHAPTER XI

                              M

     The Prohibition against
       Evoking the Dead
       1. The Church does not in any way deny the reality of spirit
manifestations. On the contrary, as we have seen in the preceding
citations, it accepts them all but attributes them exclusively to
the intervention of demons. However, anyone who would invoke
the Gospels in prohibiting them would be mistaken because the
Gospels do not say one word regarding the matter. The main,
prevailing argument is the prohibition by Moses. In the following,
we will provide the words in which the same pastoral letter that we
cited in previous chapters addresses the subject:
       “It is not permitted to enter into relations with them
(spirits), either directly or through the intermediation of those
who evoke and question them. The Mosaic Law punished with
death the detestable practices in use among the Gentiles. ‘Do not
seek out magicians,’ says the book of Leviticus, ‘nor seek to know
anything from fortune tellers, lest you contaminate yourselves by
addressing them’ (Lev. 19:31). ‘Any man or woman in whom there
is a necromantic or pythonic spirit must be put to death; they
shall be stoned and their blood shall fall upon their heads’ (Lev.
20:27). The book of Deuteronomy states, ‘Allow none to remain
alive among you who consult diviners, or who observe dreams and
omens, or who use spells, sorcery or enchantments, or who consult

                               165

                        Part One - Chapter XI


those who have a pythonic spirit and practice fortune telling or
who inquire of the dead to know the truth. The Lord considers all
such things as abominations and at your coming shall destroy the
nations that commit such crimes’ (Deut. 18:10-12).”
       2. To better understand the true meaning of the Mosaic
words, it will be useful to reproduce the entire text completely,
which was abbreviated in the preceding quotations. Thus:
       “Do not turn from your God to seek out magicians; do
not consult diviners, lest you contaminate yourselves by going to
them. I am the Lord your God” (Lev. 19:31).
       “Any man or woman in whom there is a necromantic spirit
or pythonic spirit must be punished with death; they shall be
stoned and their blood shall fall upon their head” (Lev. 20:27).
       “When you have entered the land that the Lord your God
shall give you, watch yourselves, so that you do not imitate the
abominations of such people. And let there be none among you
who intend to purify son or daughter by passing them through the
fire, or those who consult fortune tellers or observe dreams and
omens, or who use spells, sorcery or enchantments; who consult
those who have a necromantic or pythonic spirit, or who intend to
divine or inquire of the dead in order to know the truth. The Lord
considers all such things as abominations and at your coming shall
destroy all such peoples because of these kinds of crimes, which
they have committed” (Deut. 18:9-12).
       3. If the Mosaic Law must be so strictly observed on this
point, the same must equally apply to all other points, for why
would it apply to evocations but not to other matters? Consistency
is required. Since it is recognized that the Mosaic Law is no longer
in agreement with our age and customs in certain cases, the same
reason applies to the prohibition we are addressing.
       Moreover, we must discuss the motives that justified this
prohibition – they had their reason for being – but which today


                                166

               The Prohibition against Evoking the Dead


obviously no longer exist. The Hebrew law-giver wanted his people
to abandon all the customs they had acquired while in Egypt, where
evocations were in use and were subject to abuse, as evidenced in
these words from Isaiah: “The spirit of Egypt will vanish by itself
and I will overturn the Egyptians’ plans; they shall consult their
idols, their fortune tellers, and their magicians” (Is. 19:3).
       Hence, the Israelites were not to form any alliances with
foreign nations. They would encounter the same practices among
these cultures and they would soon be fighting against them. For
political reasons, Moses thus had to inspire the Hebrew people’s
aversion toward all the customs that had points of contact with
the ones acquired in Egypt. In order to encourage such aversion,
Moses needed to make them understand such practices as being
condemned by God; hence these words: “The Lord considers all
such things as abominations and at your coming shall destroy the
nations that commit such crimes.”
       4. Moses’ prohibition was well-justified because evoking
the dead did not originate from sentiments of respect, affection
or piety toward them. Instead, it was a means of fortune telling,
much like the omens and auguries exploited by charlatanism
and superstition. Try as he might, however, Moses was unable
to uproot these customs. They had been transformed into an
object of business, as is attested to by the following passage by
the same prophet:
       “And when they say to you, ‘Consult the magicians and
fortune tellers who murmur their spells,’ answer them, ‘Doesn’t
each people consult its own God? And should one inquire of the
dead concerning the living?’” (Is. 8:19)
       “It is I who enable you to see the falsehood of magical
omens; it is I who make those who try to foretell the future appear
foolish; it is I who overturn the mind of wise men and confound
their vain knowledge” (Is. 44:25).


                                 167

                        Part One - Chapter XI


       “Let those fortune tellers who contemplate the heavenly
bodies and count the months in order to make predictions, and
who desire to reveal the future to you, come forward now and save
you. They have been made into straw and the fire has devoured
them. They will not free their souls from the burning flames. From
the burning fire, there shall not be left any coals with which they
can warm themselves or even before which they may sit. This is
what shall become of all these things to which you have devoted
yourselves so diligently. Those merchants that had done business
with you since your youth will disappear, and one by one will not
be found to draw you from your evils” (Is. 47:13-15).
       In this chapter, Isaiah is addressing the Babylonians by using
the allegorical figure of the “virgin daughter of Babylon, daughter
of the Chaldeans” (v. 1). He states that fortune tellers will not
prevent the downfall of the monarchy. In the following chapter he
addresses the Israelites directly:
       “You others, come here, you children of a sorceress,
you offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute. Whom are you
mocking? At whom do you open your mouths and stick out your
cruel tongues? Are you not perverse children and rejected bastards,
you who seek comfort in your gods beneath every tree covered
with leaves, and who sacrifice your babes in the ravines under the
overhanging rocks? You have placed your trust in the rocks of the
ravine; you have poured out drink offerings in their honor; you
have offered them sacrifices. After all this, should my indignation
not kindle against you?” (Is. 57:3-6).
       These words are unequivocal and clearly show that at that
time evocations were for the purpose of fortune telling and that
at the same time they comprised a business associated with the
practices of magic and sorcery; they were even accompanied with
human sacrifice. Moses was therefore right to prohibit such things
and to affirm that God loathed them. Such superstitious practices


                                168

               The Prohibition against Evoking the Dead


continued even through the Middle Ages, but today reason
predominates and Spiritism has come to show the exclusively moral,
consoling and religious purpose of relations with those beyond the
grave. Consequently, since Spiritists “do not sacrifice children or
make drink offerings to honor gods”; since they do not inquire of
heavenly bodies, the dead or sorcerers in order to divine the future
that God has wisely hidden from humankind; since they reject
any form of making a business of the faculty of communicating
with spirits, which some possess; since they are not motivated
by curiosity or greed but by a sentiment of piety and a desire to
learn, improve themselves, and to comfort suffering souls, then
Moses’ prohibition does not relate in any way to them. If those
who complain against Spiritists would delve more deeply into the
meaning of the biblical words, they would realize that there is no
analogy between what was occurring among the Hebrews and the
principles of Spiritism. Moreover, Spiritism condemns everything
that motivated Moses’ interdict; however, in their blind desire to
find arguments to fight new ideas, its adversaries do not perceive
that such arguments are completely erroneous.
       Contemporary criminal law punishes all the abuses that
Moses meant to repress. However, if he pronounced the ultimate
penalty against transgressors, it was because he needed severe
means for governing such an unruly people. Furthermore, this
penalty was constantly present throughout the Mosaic Law code
because there was not much else to choose from as a means of
repression. There were neither prisons nor correctional institutions
in the desert, and his people were not of a nature that was afraid of
purely disciplinary punishment. Besides, Moses could not gradate
punishments as we can nowadays. It is therefore erroneous to
support oneself on the severity of the punishment to prove the
degree of culpability for evoking the dead. Out of respect for the
Mosaic Law, would it be necessary to retain the death penalty in all


                                 169

                          Part One - Chapter XI


the matters in which it was prescribed? Why so insistently revive
this particular article while at the same time keeping quiet about
the beginning of the chapter in Deuteronomy, which prohibits
priests from possessing earthly assets and sharing in any inheritance,
because the Lord is their proper inheritance? (Deut. 28:1-2).
       5. There are two distinct parts in the Mosaic Law: the law of
God per se, promulgated on Mt. Sinai, and the civil or criminal law,
adapted to the customs and character of the people. The former
law is invariable while the latter changes over time, and it would
occur to no one that we should be governed according to the same
means as the Jews in the desert any more than we in 19th century
France should be governed by the Capitularies of Charlemagne.
For example, who would think about reviving this article of the
Mosaic Law today: “If a bull gores a man or woman to death, let
the bull be stoned to death and let no one eat its flesh; however,
the bull’s owner shall be found innocent”? (Ex. 21: 28 ff.).
       This article, which seems so absurd to us, had no other
object than to punish the bull and hold the owner innocent, and
it simply entailed the confiscation of the animal that caused the
accident in order to make the owner be more careful. The loss of
the bull was the owner’s punishment and would have been very
severe for a people of herders. It would have hindered others from
allowing the same wrong to happen. However, the loss benefited
no one because eating the bull’s flesh was prohibited. Other articles
prescribe cases in which the owner is responsible.
       Everything had its reason for being in Moses’ legislation,
for everything was foreseen in it down to the last detail. But the
form as well as the basis was adapted to the circumstances of the
occasion. If Moses were to return today to give a new code to a
civilized European nation, he would not give that of the Hebrews.
       6. It may be objected that all the laws of Moses, as well as those
received on Sinai, were dictated in God’s name. However, if we regard


                                  170

                The Prohibition against Evoking the Dead


all of them as being of divine origin, why are the commandments
limited to the Decalogue? What is the reason for the difference? If all
the laws have emanated from God, all are equally obligatory; then why
aren’t they all observed? For instance, why hasn’t circumcision been
retained, to which Jesus himself was submitted and did not abolish?
It is forgotten that in order to lend more authority to their laws, all
ancient legislators attributed a divine origin to them. More than any
other, Moses needed such divine support due to the character of his
people, and if in spite of this he had so much difficulty in making
them obey his law, how much worse the situation would have been if
he had promulgated his laws in his own name.
        Didn’t Jesus come to modify the Mosaic Law, and didn’t
his own law become the code for Christians? Didn’t he say: You
know that such and such a thing was said to the ancients, but I
now tell you further? But did he touch the law of Sinai? Certainly
not; he sanctioned it and his entire moral doctrine is nothing more
than a further development of it. Nowhere did Jesus allude to the
prohibition against evoking the dead. Nevertheless, it was too
serious a subject for him to have omitted it from his teachings,
whereas he had addressed others that were more secondary.
        7. In sum, it is a question of knowing if the Church places
the Mosaic Law above the Gospel Law; in other words, if it is
more Jewish than Christian. It is worth noting that of all religions,
Judaism opposes Spiritism least because Judaism does not invoke
the Mosaic Law against relations with the dead, a law on which the
Christian sects themselves rest.
        8. There is a further contradiction: if Moses prohibited
the evoking of spirits, it was because they could actually appear,
for otherwise the prohibition would have been needless. Thus, if
they could manifest back then, they can do so today, and if they
are the spirits of the dead, then they are not demons exclusively;
furthermore, Moses never even spoke of demons.


                                  171

                         Part One - Chapter XI


        It is therefore obvious that one cannot support oneself
logically on the Law of Moses in this case for the dual reason that
it does not govern Christianity and it is not proper for the customs
of our time. Nonetheless, even if we were to suppose that the
Mosaic Law has as much authority as some grant it, it still would
not apply to Spiritism, as we have just seen.
        It is true that Moses’ prohibition entails interrogating the
dead, but only secondarily as an accessory to the practices of
sorcery. The word interrogate alongside fortune teller and sorcerer
shows that amongst the Hebrews evocations were a means of
fortune telling. However, Spiritists do not evoke the dead to receive
illicit revelations but to receive their wise counsels and to seek
relief on behalf of those who suffer. Obviously, if the Hebrews
had used such communications from beyond the grave for such
a purpose, then instead of prohibiting the practice, Moses would
have encouraged it because such communications would have
greatly benefited his people.
        9. Of course, although there are facetious or ill-intended
critics who have described Spiritist meetings as assemblies of
sorcerers or necromancers and mediums as fortune tellers, if
charlatans have sometimes mixed up the name Spiritism with
the foolish practices that it itself condemns, there are plenty of
people who are aware of the essentially moral and serious nature of
Spiritist meetings. The Doctrine, written for all people, sufficiently
protests against abuses of any kind so that the slander falls upon
those who really deserve it.
        10. Evocation, they say, shows a lack of respect for the dead,
whose ashes should not be disturbed. Who says this? Antagonists
from two opposing camps, who join hands: disbelievers, who do
not believe in souls, and those who, although believing in souls,
claim that they cannot manifest themselves and that it is really the
Devil who manifests.


                                 172

               The Prohibition against Evoking the Dead


        When an evocation is made religiously and reverently,
when spirits are called not out of curiosity but out of affection
and sympathy and with a sincere desire for instruction and moral
improvement, we do not see how there can be any more lack of
respect in calling individuals after death than in calling them while
they are alive. However, there is another peremptory response to
this objection, which is that spirits appear spontaneously, without
coercion and often without even being called. They also tell of the
satisfaction they experience in communicating with human beings
and they sometimes complain of being forgotten by those they left
behind. If spirits’ peace were disturbed or if they did not like to
be called, they would certainly say so and would not manifest, but
since they are free, then whenever they answer us it is because they
have accepted the call.
        11. There is a further alleged reason: “Souls remain in the
dwelling place to which divine justice has assigned them, that is,
in hell or in heaven.” Consequently, those who are in hell cannot
leave, even though demons are completely free to do so. The souls
that are in heaven are completely involved in their blissfulness;
they are much too superior to mortals to be concerned about them
and they are so blissful that they would never return to this earth
full of miseries in the interest of the family and friends they left
here. Aren’t these souls rather like the rich who look away from
the poor so as not to have their digestion affected? If that were
the case, they would hardly be worthy of such supreme happiness
because it would be a reward for selfishness. Moreover, there are
still those who are in purgatory, but they are suffering souls and
must think of their own salvation before anything else. Thus,
neither the former nor the latter can answer our call; only the
Devil can manifest in their stead. Therefore, if they themselves
cannot come, then there is no reason for us to be concerned about
disturbing their rest.


                                 173

                         Part One - Chapter XI


       12. Here another problem arises. If blissful souls cannot
leave their glorious mansion in order to help mortals, why does
the Church invoke the assistance of the saints, who must be
enjoying the greatest bliss possible? Why does it advise the faithful
to invoke them in cases of sickness, affliction and for protection
against calamity? Why, according to the Church, do the saints and
the Virgin herself appear to individuals in visions and perform
miracles? Thus, they leave heaven to come down to earth. If those
who are high in heaven can leave it, why is it that those who are in
a less elevated place cannot?
       13. That disbelievers deny the manifestation of souls is
understandable due to the fact that they do not believe souls exist
in the first place, but what is odd is to see those whose belief rests
precisely on the soul’s existence and future angrily oppose the very
means of proving its existence and make every effort to show that such
is impossible! It would seem natural, however, for those who have
the most interest in the soul’s existence to joyfully accept as a grace
of Providence the means to refute skeptics with irrefutable proof,
since they are the ones who actually deny religion itself. These
constantly deplore the avalanche of disbelief that is decimating
the flock of the faithful, but when they are given the most
powerful means of combating it, they reject it more obstinately
than disbelievers themselves. Then when such proofs multiply to
the point of leaving no more doubt, they resort to the supreme
approach of prohibiting the subject from being discussed at all,
seeking to justify their position with an article of the Mosaic Law
which no one remembers and to which they strongly intend to
give a meaning that it does not have. And they are so joyful at such
a discovery that they do not realize that this same article is actually
a justification for the Spiritist Doctrine.
       14. None of the alleged reasons for condemning relations
with spirits can hold up under serious examination. From the


                                 174

                The Prohibition against Evoking the Dead


eagerness with which they oppose it, it is easy to deduce the big
personal interest connected to the subject; otherwise, they would
not be so insistent. In observing such a crusade by all sects against
spirit manifestations, one might say that they are virtually terrified
of them. The real reason could be their fear that because spirits see
things much more clearly, they might come to enlighten humans
concerning points that the churches would rather keep hidden,
and enable people to know exactly what the other world is like
and the real conditions of both the fortunate and misfortunate in that
place. That is why one tells a child, “Don’t go there because of the
boogie man,” or why one tells adults, “Don’t evoke spirits because
only the Devil will answer you.” It does not matter, however. They
can try to prevent people from evoking them, but they cannot
prevent them from coming to people, bringing the light out from
beneath the bushel.
       The creed that holds the absolute truth has nothing to fear
of that light because the light makes the truth shine forth; the
Devil could not prevail against the truth.
       15. Rejecting communications from beyond the grave is
the same as rejecting the most powerful means of learning which
results from knowing about the future life and the examples that
such communications furnish to us. Furthermore, experience has
taught us the good that we can do by turning imperfect spirits
from evil and helping those who are suffering to detach themselves
from matter and improve themselves. To forbid communicating
with suffering souls is therefore to deprive them of the assistance
that we can and must provide them. The following words of a
spirit wonderfully sum up the effects of evocation when done for
a charitable purpose:
       “Every suffering and unfortunate spirit will tell you about
the cause of its downfall and the follies to which it succumbed; it
will tell you about its hopes, struggles and fears; its regrets, pain


                                  175

and desperation; it will show you God, justifiably displeased,
severely punishing the wrongdoer. Upon hearing this, you will be
moved with compassion for the spirit and with fear for yourselves.
And if you follow its complaints, you will see that God has not
lost sight of it, that he is always awaiting the repentant sinner, and
will open his arms as soon as it begins to progress towards him.
You will see the wrongdoer’s progress, to which you will have the
happiness and glory of contributing; you will follow it with the
solicitude of the surgeon seeing the healing of the wound that he
cares for daily” (Bordeaux, 1861).

                   The Passage
       1. Being certain about the future life does not exclude being
apprehensive about the passage from this life to that one. There are
many people who do not fear death per se, but what they do dread
is the moment of transition. During that passage, do we suffer or
not? This is what worries them, and with good reason, for no one
can run from that transition. One can decline any trip while in
this world, but in the case in question both the rich and the poor
will have to make the journey, and if it is a painful one neither
status nor fortune will mitigate its bitterness.
       2. Upon seeing the peacefulness of some deaths and the
awful convulsions of agony of others, one can see very well that
the sensations of the moment are not always the same. But who
can enlighten us regarding the matter? Who can describe the
physiological phenomenon of the separation of the soul from
the body? Who can tell us about the impressions of that supreme
moment? On this matter, science and religion have nothing to say.
       But why don’t they? Because they lack an understanding
of the laws that govern the relationship between the spirit and
matter; one stops at the threshold of the spirit life, while the
other stops at the threshold of the material life. Spiritism is the
intersecting point of union between both, and only Spiritism can
tell us how the transition occurs, whether because of the positive
notions it offers about the nature of the soul, or whether because


                                179

                             Part 2 - Chapter I


of the information given by those who have already left life on
earth behind. Understanding the fluidic tie that binds the soul to
the body is the key to this and many other phenomena.
       3. That inert matter is insensitive is a fact; only the soul
experiences sensations of pain and pleasure. During life, every
physical disaggregation impacts on the soul, which in turn receives
an impression that is either more painful or less so. It is the soul
that suffers and not the body. The body per se is nothing more than
an instrument of pain – the soul is what actually feels it. When
separated from the soul at death, the body can be mutilated at will
and will feel nothing. The soul is isolated from the body and is no
longer touched by any effect of the body’s destruction. The soul
has sensations of its own but their source is not in tangible matter.
       The perispirit is the fluidic envelope of the soul and is
not separate from it either before death or afterward. The two
together may be said to form a whole, for one cannot be conceived
of without the other. During earthly life, the perispiritual fluid
penetrates the body at every point and serves as a vehicle for the
physical sensations of the soul, whereas the soul operates through
the perispirit to act upon the body and guide its movements.
       4. The extinction of organic life produces the separation of
the soul from the body by breaking the fluidic connection that
links them together; however, this process never occurs abruptly.
The perispiritual fluid disengages little by little from all the organs
so that the separation is complete and final only when not a single
atom of the perispirit is connected to any one molecule of the body.
The painful sensation that the soul experiences at that moment results
directly from the number of points of contact between the body and
perispirit, and this in turn determines the greater or lesser difficulty or
slowness of the separation. It is needless to point out that whether
death is more painful or less so depends on the circumstances. We
shall now determine what such circumstances might be.


                                    180

                                              The Passage


        5. First, let us establish the four following cases, which we
can view as extreme situations within whose boundaries there are
an infinite number of variations: 1) if at the time of the extinction
of organic life the disengagement of the perispirit has already been
completed, the soul will feel absolutely nothing; 2) if at that time
the union of the two elements is still in full force, a sort of rupture
will occur that impacts very painfully on the soul; 3) if the union
is weak, the separation will be easy and occur without shock; 4)
if after the complete cessation of organic life there are still several
points of contact between the body and the perispirit, the soul
will feel the effects of the body’s decomposition until the tie is
completely dissolved.
        Based on these facts, the suffering that accompanies
death will depend on the adhering force that binds the body to
the perispirit. Everything that might help to weaken this force
accelerates the speed of the disengagement process, making
the passage less difficult. Finally, if the disengagement occurs
without difficulty, the soul will not experience any unpleasant
sensation whatsoever.
        6. In the transition from the corporeal life to the spirit
life, another crucially important phenomenon occurs: the state
of confusion.56 During this time, the soul experiences a sort of
numbness that temporarily paralyzes its faculties and neutralizes the
sensations it feels, at least partly. The soul is in a state of catalepsy,
so to speak, because it is almost never consciously aware of the last
sigh of death. We say almost never, because there are cases in which
the soul can consciously perceive the disengagement, as we will
soon discuss. The state of confusion at the time of death can thus
be regarded as normal and may last for an indeterminate time,
varying from a few hours to many years. As the soul gradually frees
itself, it is in a state comparable to when someone awakens from a
56

                                                   181

                                         Part 2 - Chapter I


deep sleep: its thoughts are confused, vague and uncertain; things
are perceived as through a fog, but little by little, sight becomes
clearer and memory returns. For some spirits, this awakening
process is peaceful, entailing delightful sensations; it is quite
different for others, though: full of terror and anxiety, producing
the effect of a horrible nightmare.
        7. The last sigh of death is not therefore the most
painful moment, because the soul is not usually even aware of
it; however, the soul can suffer before that moment from the
disaggregation of the body’s matter during the death throes, and
afterward from the anxiety of the state of confusion. We would
be quick to add that this situation is not always the rule since
the intensity and duration of the suffering (as we have previously
stated) are a direct result of the affinity between the body and
the perispirit.57 Consequently, the greater the affinity, the more
difficult and prolonged will be the soul’s efforts to disengage
itself. There are persons in whom the connection is so weak that
the disengagement occurs by itself, naturally; the spirit detaches
from the body like a ripe fruit falling from the stem. Such is the
case of peaceful deaths and tranquil awakenings.
        8. The principal cause behind the greater or lesser difficulty
of the disengagement is the soul’s moral state. The affinity between
the body and the perispirit is proportional to the attachment
between the spirit and matter, which is most pronounced in
individuals whose preoccupations exclusively and solely involve
the material pleasures that life offers. On the other hand, in pure
souls who identify themselves with the spirit life beforehand,
such attachment is almost non-existent. And since the slowness
and difficulty of disengagement are a result of the soul’s degree
of purity and dematerialization, it depends on us to render the
disengagement easy or difficult, pleasant or painful.

                             The Passage


       Therefore, whether as a theory or as the result of observation,
it remains for us to examine the influence the kind of death has
upon the soul’s sensations during the last moment.
       9. In natural death resulting from the extinction of the life
forces due to old age or disease, the disengagement occurs over
the time prior to death. For individuals whose soul has become
dematerialized and whose thoughts have been detached from
earthly matters, the disengagement is nearly complete before
actual death; that is, even though the body still has organic life,
the spirit has already entered the spirit life and is only connected
to the body by a very fragile cord that snaps easily with the last
heartbeat. In such a case, the spirit may have already recovered its
lucidity and can consciously witness the extinction of life from the
body, from which it is happy to have freed itself. For such a soul,
there is almost no state of confusion whatsoever; instead, the state
is no more than a moment of peaceful sleep. It awakens with an
indescribable feeling of hope and blessedness.
       However, in materialistic and sensual individuals, who have
lived more according to the body than the spirit, and for whom
the spirit life has meant nothing – it has not even been part of their
reality – everything has contributed to tightening the material ties.
Nothing has been done to loosen them during life, so when death
arrives, disengagement does eventually occur, although it demands
continued effort. The death throes are the sign of the struggle of
the spirit, who wavers between tying to break the resistant cord
and trying to hold onto the body; nevertheless, an irresistible force
violently shakes the spirit loose molecule by molecule.
       10. The more the spirit clings to corporeal life, the less it
sees beyond it. It senses that life is escaping and wants to hold
onto it. Instead of giving into the forces that are pulling it out,
it resists with all its strength and can thus prolong the struggle
for days, weeks and months on end. During this time, of course,


                                 183

                          Part 2 - Chapter I


the spirit does not enjoy full lucidity, since the state of confusion
actually began well before actual death; however, this does not
mean that it suffers any less, and the state of mental vacuity in
which it finds itself and the uncertainty as to what will happen
next increase its anguish. Death has come but nothing ends; the
confusion continues. The spirit feels that it is alive, but does not
know if this life is physical or spiritual. It continues to struggle
until the last connections between the perispirit and the body
are broken. Death has put an end to the malady the body had
been suffering but it has not stopped its consequences, so that
as long as there are still points of contact between the body and
perispirit, the spirit is still affected by such consequences and
suffers from them.
       11. The situation is markedly different for the dematerialized
spirit, even in the case of the direst infirmities. Having become
quite fragile, the fluidic ties binding the spirit to the body are
easily broken. Furthermore, its trust in the future, which it has
already foreseen mentally and sometimes actually, enables it to
view its infirmities as a trial and death as a redemption; hence
the mental tranquility and resignation that ease its suffering.
After death, with the ties having been instantaneously broken,
it feels no painful reaction whatsoever. Upon awakening, it feels
free, animated, relieved of a heavy weight and very happy at not
having to suffer any longer.
       12. In violent death, the situation is not exactly the same.
Since no partial disaggregation has led to a separation between
the body and perispirit beforehand, organic life is suddenly
snatched away while still fully in force. The detachment of the
perispirit only begins after death and in such a case, as in others,
this cannot happen all at once. The spirit is taken by surprise
and feels bewildered, but perceiving that it can still think, it
believes it is still alive. This delusion lasts until it can gain an


                                 184

                               The Passage


understanding of its new situation. This type of intermediary state
between corporeal and spirit life is one of the most interesting
subjects for study because it presents the peculiar situation of a
spirit who mistakes its fluidic body as being its physical one and it
experiences all the sensations of organic life. Such a case displays a
variety of nuances that depend on the character, knowledge, and
degree of the spirit’s moral development. It lasts only a little while
for those whose soul is purified, because the disengagement always
begins beforehand, so that even the most unexpected death merely
hastens its completion. For others, however, it can last for years.
This state is quite frequent even in cases of ordinary death. For
some it presents nothing painful – depending on the spirit’s moral
qualities – while for others it is a dreadful situation. It is in cases
of suicide, especially, that this situation is the most dolorous: the
body remains connected to the perispirit by all its fibers, and thus
all the body’s convulsions reverberate in the soul and it undergoes
atrocious suffering.
       13. The state of the spirit at the time of death can be
summarized as follows: the slower the disengagement of its perispirit,
the more the spirit suffers. The speed of the disengagement depends
on the spirit’s degree of moral development. For the dematerialized
spirit with a clear conscience, death is only a temporary sleep, free
of suffering, and the awakening is very gentle.
       14. In order for people to make every effort to purify
themselves by restraining their evil tendencies and overcoming
their passions, they must understand the advantages of doing so for
the future. In order to identify with the future life, aspiring to it and
preferring it to earthly life, it is not enough for people to merely
believe that it exists. They must understand it. They must regard
that life from a point of view which satisfies reason and which is
thoroughly in agreement with logic and commonsense, and they
must hold an idea of the grandeur, goodness and justice of God.

                           Part 2 - Chapter I


Of all philosophical doctrines, Spiritism is the one that exerts the
most powerful influence in this regard, thanks to the unshakable
faith it provides.
       Authentic Spiritists are not content with merely believing:
they believe because they comprehend, and they comprehend by
calling upon their reason. The future life is thus a reality that
incessantly unfolds before their eyes. They see and touch that
life at every moment, so to speak. Doubt cannot enter their
mind. The so very limited corporeal life disappears in the face
of the spirit life, which presents itself as the true life. This is the
reason why they give little importance to incidents along the
way and why they confront all life’s vicissitudes with resignation,
understanding their causes and usefulness. The direct relations
that Spiritists maintain with the invisible world uplift their
soul. The fluidic connections that bind their spirit to matter
become weakened, and thus an initial, partial detachment
occurs that facilitates its passage from this life to the next.
The state of confusion is inseparable from the transition but
is of short duration, because as soon as such a spirit crosses
the boundary, it recognizes itself and realizes that nothing is
strange; it comprehends the new situation.
       15. Of course, Spiritism is obviously not indispensable for
arriving at this result, nor does it claim to be the only means to
ensure the soul’s salvation. Nonetheless, it facilitates it through
the knowledge it provides, the sentiments it inspires and the
dispositions it gives to the spirit, enabling it to comprehend the
need to improve itself. Moreover, it gives each individual the
means of facilitating the disengagement of other spirits at the
time they leave their earthly envelope behind, and the means of
shortening their state of confusion through prayer and evocation.
Sincere prayer is a form of spiritual magnetization that brings
about a more rapid disaggregation of the perispiritual fluid.

                                           The Passage


An evocation directed with understanding and prudence, using
words of benevolence and encouragement, helps the departing
spirit out of its bewilderment and enables it to recognize itself
more quickly. If it is a suffering spirit, an evocation can incite
repentance, the only means of shortening its suffering.58

      The examples that we are about to cite represent spirits at different levels of happiness and
     unhappiness in the spirit life. We have not sought out illustrious personages of antiquity,
     whose situation could very well have changed considerably after the lifetime in which
     they were known, and thus they would not be able to provide sufficient proof of their
     authenticity. Instead, we have taken our examples from the most ordinary circumstances
     of contemporary life, since these are the ones in which we can find greater potential for
     comparison and from which we can receive the most advantageous instructions. The closer
     the earthly existence of these spirits is to ours – whether by social position, family ties or
     relationships – the more they interest us, and the easier it is to authenticate their identity.
     Commonplace situations are naturally greater in number, and that is why we can more easily
     derive the necessary applications from them. Exceptional situations affect us less by being
     outside the sphere of what we are accustomed to. Therefore, they are not the examples
     we were looking for. Although in these following examples there may be a few known
     personages, most are entirely obscure individuals. Famous names would add nothing
     with respect to the instruction and could even wound susceptibilities. We do not address
     ourselves to the curious or lovers of scandal, but only to those who intend to be instructed.
     These examples could be multiplied to infinity; however, we must limit their number
     and have thus chosen those that could best cast light on the spirit’s situation in the spirit
     world, whether in virtue of the spirit’s current condition or by the explanations that it is in
     a position to give. Most of these communications are unedited and only a few have been
     published in Revue Spirite. We have removed superfluous details from those, retaining only
     the points essential for our proposed objective. We have added to them supplementary
     instructions that took place afterwards. – Auth.

I wish to remind you of a request I made about a year ago. Please

beyond the grave by providing you the means of studying, step by
step, through evocation, the various circumstances resulting from
what is commonly called death, but which for us Spiritists is only
a transformation in accordance with the impenetrable designs of
God, though always useful for his purposes.
       “Besides this authorization and request for you to give
me the honor of this sort of ‘spiritual autopsy’ – which my very
little advancement as a spirit will perhaps render unfruitful, in
which case your prudence will naturally lead you to go no farther

than a certain number of experiments – I would dare to ask you
personally, as well as all my colleagues, to pray to the Almighty to
allow the good Spirits to assist me with their benevolent counsels.
In particular, I would ask St. Louis, our Spirit President, to guide
me in the choice and time for a new incarnation, an idea that I have
been very preoccupied with lately. I fear being mistaken about my
spiritual abilities and asking God too early and presumptuously for
a corporeal life in which I would not warrant the divine goodness,
and which, instead of serving for my advancement, would prolong
my stay on the earth or elsewhere in case I were to fail.”
         In order to satisfy his desire to be evoked as soon as possible after
his passing, we went to the mortuary with a few members of the Society,
and in the presence of his body and an hour before his burial, we were
given the following communication. We had a two-fold objective
in doing this: fulfilling his last request and observing once more the
situation of the soul immediately after death, and this with a man
who was imminently intelligent, enlightened and deeply convinced of
Spiritist principles. It was interesting for us to verify the influence of such
convictions on the state of his spirit as it gathered its first impressions of
spirit life. Our expectations were not disappointed. With perfect lucidity,
Mr. Sanson described the moment of his transition. He had been able
to witness his own death and rebirth, an unusual circumstance that was
due to the elevation of his spirit.

             (Mortuary chamber, April 23, 1862)

       1. Evocation
       “I am answering your call in order to fulfill my promise.”
       2. My dear Mr. Sanson, we ourselves are fulfilling a duty and
are pleased to be able to evoke you as soon as possible after your death,
as was your desire.

                                Happy Spirits


        “It is a special blessing of God to allow my spirit to communicate.
I thank you for your goodwill, but I am weak and trembling.”
        3. You had suffered so much that I thought we might ask you how you
feel now. Do you still feel your pain? What sensations are you experiencing in
comparing your present situation with that of two days ago?
        “My situation is quite happy, for I feel none of my former
pain. I have recovered and am renewed, as you use to say. My
transition from earth life to the spirit life might have made
everything incomprehensible at first, because we sometimes remain
many days without recovering our lucidity. But before dying, I
prayed to God, asking him to allow me to speak to those whom I
wish well. And he heard me.”
        4. How long did it take for you to recover your mental lucidity?
        “Eight hours. God, I repeat, has given me proof of his
goodness. He deemed me more worthy than I actually am and I
could never thank him as I should.”
        5. Are you sure that you no longer belong to our world? If so,
how can you prove it?
        “Oh! I am absolutely no more of your world, but I will always
be close to you in order to protect and uphold you as you proclaim
the charity and self-denial that guided my life. In my next one, I will
teach the true faith, the Spiritist faith that must uplift the beliefs of
the just and good. I feel strong and robust – transformed, in a word.
You would no longer recognize me as the old invalid who had to
avoid everything, to abandon every pleasure and happiness. I am a
spirit. My homeland is the expanse of space and my future is God
who radiates throughout the immensity of it all. I would very much
like to speak to my children in order to teach them what they always
showed themselves ill disposed to believe.
        6. How does seeing your body here affect you?
        “My body, my poor and miserable remains, must return to
dust, but I will always have a fond memory of all those who held


                                     191

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


me in esteem while incarnate. I look upon that poor decomposing
flesh, the dwelling place of my spirit, my trial for so many years!
And I say: Thank you, my poor old body! You have purified my
spirit. My suffering has been a ten-fold blessing and has earned me
a well-deserved place. That is why I have been able to communicate
to you so soon.”
        7. Did you retain your awareness up to the last instant?
        “Yes, my spirit retained its faculties. I no longer saw; I
foresaw. My entire life unfolded within my memory and my last
remembrance, my dying request, was to be able to communicate
with you as I am doing right now. I next asked God to watch over
you so that the dream of my life could be fulfilled.”
        8. Were you conscious at the moment in which your body
breathed its last? What happened to you at that time? What sensations
did you feel?
        “Life expires and sight, or rather, the spirit’s sight darkens.
You find yourself in the void, the unknown, and then as if carried
by an unknown power, you find yourself in a world where all is joy
and wonder. I no longer felt anything, nor was I sure about what
was occurring; nevertheless, an ineffable happiness surrounded me
and I no longer felt the grip of pain.
        9. Do you know... (what I intend to read at your tomb)?
        I had barely begun to speak when the spirit responded
before I could finish. Furthermore, and without having been
asked, he addresses the discussion that had taken place among the
attendees regarding the prospect of reading this communication
at the cemetery, and who were concerned about the presence of
individuals who might or might not share in our opinions.
        “Oh, my friend, I already know because I was with you
yesterday just as I am today. I am very satisfied with it! Thank you,
thank you! Read it so that they can understand me and appreciate
you. Don’t worry, for everyone is respectful in the presence of


                                  192

death. Read it so that the disbelievers may acquire faith. Goodbye.
Read it courageously and confidently so that my children may be
converted to such an honorable belief!”
                                                           J. Sanson

       During the ceremony at the cemetery, he dictated the
following words: “May you no longer fear death, my friends. It
is only another step for you if you have known how to live well.
It is full of happiness if you have worthily deserved it and have
completed your trials well. I repeat: Courage and goodwill! Do not
assign more than a mediocre value to earthly possessions and you
will be rewarded. One cannot enjoy a lot of things without depriving
others of their well-being, thereby morally committing a great evil.
May the earth lie lightly upon me!”

                              II
        (Parisian Spiritist Society, April 25, 1862)

       1. Evocation. – (Response) “My friends, I’m right here.”
       2. We were very pleased with the conversation we had with you
the other day at your burial. If you are willing, we would be happy
now to complete the subject for our instruction.
       “I am at your disposal and feel happy because you are
thinking of me.”
       3. Since an erroneous idea about the invisible world is what so
often leads to disbelief, anything that might enlighten us concerning
conditions there and which might enable us to comprehend that world
better would be of great value. So don’t be surprised at the questions
we are about to ask.
       “I won’t be surprised and I am waiting for your questions.”
       4. You have described your passage from life to death very clearly.
You said that at the moment in which your body breathed its last, your


                                   193

                                        Part 2 - Chapter II


life expired and your spirit sight darkened. Was that moment followed
by any kind of painful sensation?
        “Certainly, because life is an incessant sequence of pain, and
death is the complement to all of it. A violent rupture occurs as
though the spirit has to make a superhuman effort to escape its
envelope; it is this effort that absorbs our whole being and renders
us unconscious of the transformation we are experiencing.”
        This is not the general rule. Experience has shown that many
spirits do in fact lose consciousness before death but that among
those who have arrived at a certain degree of spiritualization, the
separation occurs without effort.
        5. Do you know if there are spirits who suffer more at that time?
For example, is it more painful for materialists, for those who believe
that everything ends at death?
        “Absolutely, because spirits who have prepared themselves
beforehand have already forgotten their suffering, that is, they have
become used to it and the serenity with which they await death
keeps them from suffering even further since they know what is
in store for them. Mental suffering is the most painful and not
having to bear it at the time of death is a big relief. Those who do
not believe are like someone who has received the death penalty:
they can see in their mind both the blade60 and the unknown. There
is a similarity between this sort of death and that of the atheist.”
        6. Are there really materialists who are so hardened that they
seriously believe that at their final moment they will plunge into
nothingness?
        “In fact, there are those who actually do believe in nothingness
up until the final moment. But at the very instant of separation, their
spirit undergoes a profound reversal; doubt seizes it and tortures it,
for it asks what will become of it. It wants to hold onto something,
but cannot. Separation cannot occur without this feeling.”
60
     An allusion to the guillotine. – Tr.

                               Happy Spirits


        On another occasion, a different spirit gave us the following
picture of the death of disbelievers:
        “In their final moments, hardened disbelievers experience the
anguish of those dreadful nightmares in which you see the rim of a
precipice and are about to fall into it. You make a futile effort to escape,
but without success. At such times you want to cling to something,
to find a point of support, but you feel yourself slipping anyway. You
want to cry out but cannot articulate any words. And that is why you
see dying persons writhe, wring their hands and moan in agony: sure
signs of the nightmare in which they now find themselves. In the
ordinary nightmare, waking up frees you from the desperation and
you feel happy at realizing it was only a dream. The nightmare of
death, however, often goes on and on – for years even – after demise,
and what makes the sensation even more painful for the spirit is the
utter darkness in which it sometimes finds itself immersed.”
        7. You said that at the moment of death you could not see, but
that you could foresee. No longer being able to see with your corporeal
eyes is understandable, but before your life finally gave out, could you
already glimpse the brightness of the spirit world?
        “It is like I said earlier: the instant of death renders the
spirit clairvoyant. The physical eyes can no longer see, but the
spirit, which possesses a much deeper sight, instantly discovers an
unknown world. The truth suddenly appears before it, temporarily
conferring on it a profound joy or inexpressible sadness, depending
on the state of its consciousness and how it remembers its last life.”
        This addresses the instant prior to the spirit losing
consciousness and explains the use of the expression temporarily,
for these same agreeable or painful impressions continue after the
spirit awakens.
        8. Would you tell us what impressed you most at the moment in
which your eyes reopened to the light? If possible, would you describe
how things looked to you?


                                    195

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


        “When I came to and saw what was there in front of me,
I was dazzled at first and couldn’t perceive things very well, since
one’s lucidity doesn’t return all at once. But God gave me profound
proof of his goodness by enabling me to recover my faculties
quickly. I saw that I was surrounded by many faithful friends. All
the protector spirits who come to assist us were smiling around me
and an unequaled happiness animated them. I felt strong and well-
disposed, and was able to travel easily through space. There are no
words in the human language that can express what I saw next.
        “I will return to you in order to speak more fully of all my
blessedness, but without going beyond the limit set by God. You
should know, however, that happiness as you understand it is only
a fiction. Live wisely and virtuously in the spirit of charity and love
and you will be prepared for the sensations that even your greatest
poets could not depict.”
        Fairytales are undoubtedly full of absurd notions, but
mightn’t they be at some points the picture of what happens in
the spirit world? Doesn’t Mr. Sanson’s account resemble that of
someone who, having slept in a poor and obscure hovel, suddenly
awakens in a splendid palace in the midst of a shining court?

                                  III

      9. Under what appearance have spirits shown themselves to
you? Under the human form?
      “Yes, my dear friend, the Spirits have taught us that in the
other world spirits retain the transitory form they had while on
earth. That is true, but what a difference there is between the
crude apparatus that used to drag itself heavily along under the
weight of its trials and the wondrous fluidity of the spirit body!
Ugliness no longer exists, for the features have lost the harshness
of expression that forms the distinct character of the human race.


                                  196

                              Happy Spirits


God has sanctified all these gracious bodies as they move about
with great elegance of form, and the language here has intonations
that are untranslatable to you. Sight possesses the depth of a star.
Use your imagination and try to see what God can do in his divine
omnipotence as the Architect of architects and you will get a faint
idea of the form of spirits.”
       10. How do you see yourself? With a limited, circumscribed
albeit fluidic form? Do you have a head, torso, arms and legs?
       “The spirit, having retained the human yet divinized and
idealized form, of course displays all those features. I feel my
legs and toes perfectly well, for if we want to we can appear to
you and squeeze your hands. Just now I squeezed my friends’
hands, thought they didn’t perceive it. Our fluidity enables us to
be anywhere without taking up space and without causing any
sensation in people if that is our desire. At this very moment your
hands are folded and I have them in mine. I can say that I am
showing you affection at the moment, but my body isn’t taking
up any space; light passes right through it. If it were visible you
would call it a miracle, but for spirits it is only the continued
action of all instants.
       “Spirit sight cannot be compared to human sight, just as
spirit bodies do not bear a true resemblance to human bodies,
because everything is different in essence and as a whole. I repeat:
the spirit possesses a divine perceptiveness that grasps everything;
it can even guess your thoughts. In addition, it can take any form
that would be the most suitable for awakening your memories, but
in such cases a high order spirit who has finished its trials prefers
the form that led it to God.”
       11. Spirits don’t have gender. Nevertheless, since it has only been
a few days since you were a man, in your new state do you have a
nature that is more male than female? Does the same thing apply to a
spirit who left its body a long time ago?


                                   197

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


       “We don’t have to be of a male or female nature: spirits
do not reproduce. God created them by his will, and since in
his wonderful designs he willed for spirits to reincarnate on the
earth, he had to include the reproduction of the species through
male and female components. But without the need for further
explanations, you must know that spirits do not have gender.”
       It has always been affirmed that spirits do not have gender,
because gender is only necessary for the reproduction of bodies.
Since spirits do not reproduce, they have no need of gender.
Our question was not meant to obtain confirmation of this fact;
however, because of Mr. Sanson’s recent death we wanted to know
if he still retained a sense of his earthly gender. Purified spirits
understand their new situation perfectly well, but among the less
evolved, non-dematerialized ones, there are many who still believe
they are under the same conditions as on earth and who hold onto
their old passions and desires. Some still regard themselves as male
or female and that is why it is sometimes said that spirits have
gender. Hence, certain contradictions have arisen, depending on
the greater or lesser advanced state of the spirits who communicate
with us. The error does not derive from the spirits themselves but
from those who interview them without having gone to the trouble
of delving into the issue.
       12. What is your appearance when you come to our sessions?
To your new sight do you have the same appearance as when you were
among us? Do individuals still look the same to you? Is everything as
clear and distinct as it used to be?
       “Much, much clearer because I can read everyone’s thoughts,
and I am quite pleased – thank you! – for the beneficent impression
of goodwill that I’m receiving from all the spirits gathered here. I
want this same harmony to exist not only in all the group meetings
in Paris but throughout France, where certain groups are estranged
from and feel envious of one another. This is a situation instigated by


                                  198

                             Happy Spirits


troublesome spirits who are pleased with disorder; however, Spiritism
must be the complete and absolute forgetfulness of one’s self.”
       13. You said you can read our thoughts. Would you explain how
this transmission of thought works?
       “That would not be easy. In order to explain this strange
ability of spirit sight, it would be necessary to open up an arsenal
of new elements about which you would have to know everything
that we know. That would be impossible since your faculties are
limited by matter. Patience! Become morally better and you will
comprehend everything. At the moment you only have what God
has granted you, but you have the ability to continue to progress.
Later on, you will be like us. Try to die righteously so that you
may know a lot. Curiosity stimulates people’s thought activity and
it certainly accompanies you into death, saving for you until that
time the satisfaction of fulfilling all your past, present and future
questions. With such in mind, I will respond well or poorly to
your question: the air that surrounds you (which is as intangible
as we are), receives your thoughts; your very breath, so to speak,
is the written page of your thoughts. These pages are read and
commented on by the spirits who are constantly near you. They
are the messengers of a divine telegraphy that none can escape.”

             The Death of the Righteous
       After Mr. Sanson’s first communications given at the Parisian
Society, a spirit transmitted the following one under the above heading:
       “The death of the man with whom you are concerned at this
time was the death of a righteous man, that is, a peaceful death full
of hope. As day naturally follows the dawn, the spirit life followed
his earthly life without trouble or disruption, and his last breath was
exhaled in a true hymn of recognition and love. How few are those who
make that difficult passage in such a way! How few are those who, after

                                  199

                                     Part 2 - Chapter II


life’s illusions and disappointments, perceive the harmonious rhythm
of the spheres! Just as when a healthy man gets a limb amputated but
continues to suffer sensations as if it were still in place, the soul of one
who dies without faith or hope is torn and afflicted upon escaping the
body; it is cast into space unconscious of itself.
          “Pray for such disturbed souls; pray for all who suffer. Charity
is not restricted to the people you can see: it helps and consoles the
beings who populate the spirit world as well. You saw the touching
proof of this in the sudden conversion of that spirit who was moved
by the Spiritist prayers you offered at the grave of this righteous
man. 61 It is right for you to interview him, for he wants to enable
you to progress on the righteous path. Love knows no bounds. It
expands throughout space, alternately giving and receiving divine
consolation. The sea seems to extend infinitely beyond one’s sight.
Its edge on the horizon seems to meet the sky and one’s spirit is
dazzled at the magnificent spectacle of those two immensities. Thus,
love, which is deeper than the sea and more infinite than space,
should bind all of you, both the living and spirits, in one and the
same communion of charity, thereby accomplishing the wonderful
fusion of the ephemeral with the eternal.”
                                                                   Georges

                            Happy Spirits


        Mr. Jobard had been the Honorary President of the Parisian
Spiritist Society. We thought about evoking him during the
November 8 meeting. He had anticipated our evocation and
spontaneously gave us the following communication:
        “I am here, I whom you have evoked, and who until now
had hoped in vain to manifest through this medium.
        “First of all, I would like to tell you about my impressions
at the moment of my soul’s liberation. I felt an inexpressible jolt. I
suddenly recalled my birth, my youth and my old age: my whole
life passed in detail within my memory. However, I most fully
experienced the desire to find myself in the regions revealed by our
beloved faith. Then, all the agitation ceased; I felt freed while my
body remained inert. Ah, my dear friends, how joyful it is to be free
of the weight of the body! What ecstasy there is in embracing space!
But you mustn’t think that I suddenly became one of the Lord’s
elect. No, I am among the spirits who have assimilated a little but
still have much to learn. It did not take me long to remember you,
my brothers in exile, and my best wishes surround you.
        “Would you like to know which spirits welcomed me? What
my impressions were? My friends were all the spirits whom we
have evoked, all who have been participating in our work. I saw
their splendor but I cannot describe it. I have been applying myself
to discerning what was true in the communications. I’m ready to
redress all erroneous assertions and am ready to be the same knight
of the truth in the other world that I was while in yours.”
                                                              Jobard

       1. When you were alive, you recommended that we evoke you
when you had left the earth behind. We do so now not only to meet
your desire, but especially to renew the testimony of our living and
sincere sympathy. We also hope that you may instruct us because you
are in a better position than anyone else to provide us with precise


                                 201

                            Part 2 - Chapter II


information about the world where you now find yourself. We would
appreciate it if you would answer our questions.
        “At this time, instructing you is what is most important. As
for your sympathy, I am aware of it without having to hear about
it with my ears, a fact that represents great progress for me.”
        2. In order to focus our ideas and not speak vaguely, we would
first of all ask you what part of the room you are in right now and how
we would see you if we could.
        “I am right next to the medium. I would look just like the
Jobard who used to sit at your table, because your still-veiled
mortal eyes can see spirits only under their mortal appearance.”
        3. Would it be possible for you to make yourself visible to us? If
not, what would keep you from it?
        “Your own personal state. A seeing medium might see me;
others wouldn’t.
        4. That place is the same one you used to occupy when alive
as you assisted our sessions, and which we always reserved for you.
Thus, those who used to see you sitting there might imagine you and
see you in the same way. If you do not now have your physical body,
your fluidic body nonetheless has the same form that it used to have.
If we cannot see you with our physical eyes, we can see you with the
eyes of thought. If you cannot communicate with us through speech,
you can do so through writing with the medium’s help. Therefore, our
relationship has not in any way been interrupted by your death, and
we can talk with you as easily and perfectly as before. Is that really the
way things happen?
        “Yes, and you have known it for a long time. I will continue
to occupy this seat quite often, and although you may not perceive
it, my spirit will be here amongst you.”
        Let us pay attention to that last phrase: my spirit will be here
amongst you. In this case, it does not comprise a figure of speech
but a reality. Through the understanding that Spiritism gives us

                              Happy Spirits


about the nature of spirits, we know that a spirit can be amongst
us, not only in thought but in person, thanks to its ethereal body,
which gives it its individual identity. A spirit can thus be amongst
us after death just as it used to be during corporeal life, and even
more easily since it can be so whenever it wants. We thus have a
multitude of invisible companions, some indifferent and others
connected to us through affection. It is especially the latter to
whom these words apply: They dwell amongst us, which can be
translated as: They watch, inspire and protect us.
       5. It was not too long ago that your physical body sat in the same
place. Doesn’t your present situation seem strange to you? What effects
has this change produced in you?
       “My present situation doesn’t seem strange to me, because
my discarnate spirit enjoys a lucidity that does not leave any
question unclear regarding the matter.”
       6. Do you remember having been in the same situation before
your last life and do you now perceive any change?
       “I remember my previous lives and I realize that I have
improved. I see and understand what I see. At the time of my
preceding incarnations as a confused spirit, however, I perceived
nothing but my terrestrial gaps.”
       7. Do you remember your next-to-last existence, the one
preceding that of Mr. Jobard?
       “Yes. During that lifetime I was a mechanic tormented with
poverty and the desire to improve my work. As Jobard, I fulfilled
the dreams of that poor workman. Now I praise God, whose infinite
goodness germinated the tiny seed that he had planted in my mind.”
       8. Have you communicated anywhere else yet?
       “I myself have communicated very little until now, but
another spirit has been using my name in several other places. I
have sometimes been close to it without being able to communicate
directly. My death is so recent that I still feel some of earth’s


                                  203

                             Part 2 - Chapter II


influences. I need perfect attunement in order to be able to express
my thoughts. Before long, I will be able to act indiscriminately, but
for now, I repeat, I cannot. When fairly-known individuals die, they
are always called everywhere and many spirits hurry to imitate them.
That is what has happened several times in my case. I would remind
you that few spirits can communicate right after the time of their
deliverance, even through a medium of their preference.”
        9. Can you see other spirits who are here with us?
        “I especially see Lazarus and Erastus. Then, farther away, I
see the spirit Truth hovering in space; farther still, a crowd of eager
and benevolent spirit friends surround you. Feel fortunate, my
friends, for good influences free you from the calamities of error.”
        10. During your life, you shared in the opinion that was transmitted
to us that the earth was formed by the incrustation of four planets that had
been solidified into only one. Are you still of the same opinion?
        “That was wrong. New geological discoveries have revealed
the periods of earth’s convulsions and its progressive formation.
Like other planets, the earth has had its own life and God did not
have need of such a great chaos or aggregation of planets. Water
and fire are the only organic elements of earth.”
        11. You also believed that humans could be put into a cataleptic
state for an unlimited length of time and that the human species was
brought in this way to earth.
        “An illusion of my imagination, which always surpassed
its purpose. Catalepsy can be long but not unending. Traditions
and legends exaggerated by the oriental imagination! My friends,
I have already suffered a lot at remembering the illusions with
which I used to nourish my spirit: make no mistake about it.
I have learned much and can therefore tell you that my mind
was ready to grasp vast and diverse studies, and during my last
incarnation it retained a love for the extraordinary and the
mystical drawn from popular imagination.


                                    204

                            Happy Spirits


        “I am now little concerned with purely intellectual
questions, however, in the sense in which you consider them.
How could I be, when I am in awe, enraptured by the marvelous
spectacle surrounding me? Only the bond of Spiritism, more
powerful than you humans can conceive, could make my spirit
return to this earth which I left behind, not out of joy – for
that would be irreverent – but out of profound gratitude for
my deliverance.”
        When the Society opened a membership on behalf of the
workers in Lyon in February, 1862, a co-member remitted 50
francs, 25 under his name, and 25 under Mr. Jobard’s name. Jobard
then gave the following communication regarding the matter:
        “I am grateful at realizing that I have not been forgotten
among my Spiritist brothers. I am thankful to the generous heart
who made the offering that I would have made myself if I were
still in your world. In the world where I am now, we have no
need of money. Thus, I would have to resort to the pocketbook
of friendship to materially show that I had been touched by the
misfortune of my brothers in Lyon. Brave workers, who ardently
cultivate the vineyard of the Lord, you may be certain that
charity is not just an empty word, for both great and small have
demonstrated their sympathy and fraternal love to you. You are on
the broad humanitarian road of progress. May God keep you on it
and may you be even happier. Your spirit friends will uphold you
and you shall triumph.
        “I have begun to live as a spirit now, more at peace and less
troubled by the evocations that rain down upon me from every
quarter. Fads prevail even regarding spirits. When the ‘Jobard’
fad is replaced by some other and I will have fallen into human
forgottenness, I will then pray that my real friends – those whom
I see have not forgotten me – I will pray that they will evoke me.
Then we shall delve into the issues that have been addressed too


                                205

superficially, and your Jobard, completely transfigured, will be able
to be useful to you: something he desires with all his heart.”
                                                              Jobard

       After the earlier occasions dedicated to reassuring his friends,
Mr. Jobard took his place among the spirits who are actively working
for social renewal as he awaits his next return to be among the
living in order to act more directly in this capacity. Since that time,
he has frequently given incontestably superior communications to
the Parisian Society, of which he continues as an associate, without
departing from the originality and good spiritual humor that used
to comprise the depth of his character. This is what enables us to
recognize him even before he signs his name.

                      Samuel Philippe
       Samuel Philippe was a righteous man in every sense of the
word. No one could remember having seen him commit an evil
act or having intentionally wronged anyone in any way. He was
unrestrictedly devoted to his friends, who were always sure to find
him at their service when they needed him, even at the expense of
his own private interests. Work, fatigue, sacrifice – nothing kept him
from being useful; he served naturally, without being ostentatious,
and seemed perplexed whenever anyone gave him any credit for it.
He never wished ill on anyone who had harmed him; instead, he
sought to be of service to them as if they had actually done good
to him. Whenever he endured ungratefulness, he would say to us,
“I’m not the one you should pity – they are.” Although he was
very intelligent and endowed with much energy, his very laborious
life was obscure and full of severe trials. He was one of those elite
types who flourish in the shadows, whom the world does not
recognize and whose light is not reflected over the earth. Through

                                  206

                              Happy Spirits


an understanding of Spiritism, he acquired an ardent faith in the
future life and a great resignation before the ills of earthly life. After
having suffered a painful disease, he died in December 1862 at the
age of 50. He was truly mourned both by family and friends and has
been evoked many times since his death.
        1. Do you clearly remember your last few moments on earth?
        “Perfectly. My memory of them has returned to me little by
little, although at the time my thoughts were still confused.”
        2. Because your exemplary life awakened our interest so much,
would you mind describing to us, for our own instruction, how your
passage from the corporeal to the spirit life occurred, as well as the
situation in which you now find yourself in the spirit world?
        “Gladly. This account won’t be useful only to you, but to me
as well. In turning my thoughts back to the earth, the comparison
will enable me to appreciate even more the goodness of our Creator.
        “You know how full of tribulation my life was; however, I
never lacked courage in the face of adversity – thank God! And
now I must congratulate myself on it. How much I would have
lost if I had given in to discouragement! I quake at the thought,
for then my suffering would have been of no use and I would have
had to start all over again. Oh, my friends! May you grasp this
truth, for in it resides the happiness of your future. No, a few years
of suffering is certainly not too much to pay for such happiness.
If only you knew what a few years are when compared to eternity!
        “If my last life did in fact have any merit in your eyes, you
would not feel the same regarding the ones before it. It was only
due to much personal effort that I have become what I am today.
To erase the last traces of my previous wrongs, I had to suffer
those final trials and I voluntarily accepted them. I drew from
the firmness of my resolution the strength to bear them without
complaining. Now I bless them – every single one of those trials.
Thanks to them I have broken my connections with the past and


                                   207

                          Part 2 - Chapter II


it has become only a memory. I can now with true satisfaction
contemplate the path I have traveled.
       “Oh, you who made me suffer while I was on the earth, who
were hard and ill-willed toward me, who humiliated and afflicted
me, whose bad-faith often led me to the harshest privations, I
not only forgive you, I thank you! Wishing to do me wrong, you
didn’t even suspect that you were actually doing so much good.
It is therefore true that I owe you for a big part of the happiness
I now enjoy, for you provided me an opportunity to forgive, to
return evil with good. God put you in my way in order to test
my patience and enable me to practice the most difficult kind of
charity: loving one’s enemies.
       “Please don’t get impatient at this digression. I will now
finally address what you have asked of me.
       “Although I suffered dreadfully with my final illness, I didn’t
pass over in agony. My death was like sleep, without struggle or
shock. Since I had no fear about my future, I didn’t try to cling
to life, and consequently didn’t have to struggle during my last
moments. The separation occurred without effort, without pain
and without my even realizing it.
       “I don’t know how long that final sleep lasted, but it was
brief. My awakening was calm compared to my previous condition.
I no longer felt any pain and I exulted in joy. I wanted to get
up and move around, but a sort of gentle numbness, which had
nothing disagreeable about it – which even had a certain appeal –
restrained me and I gladly surrendered myself to it without being
aware of my situation but having no doubt that I had just left
the earth. Everything around me seemed like a dream. I saw my
wife and some friends kneeling and weeping in my room and I
told myself that they obviously considered me dead. I wanted
to correct them but I couldn’t articulate any words, and this led
me to the conclusion that I had to be dreaming. What seemed


                                 208

                            Happy Spirits


to confirm this idea was that I saw myself surrounded by many
beloved individuals who had died a long time ago, and others
whom I did not immediately recognize, but who seemed to be
watching me, waiting for me to wake up.
       “This state was interlaced with moments of lucidity
and drowsiness, during which I alternately recovered and lost
consciousness of my self. Little by little, my mind became clearer.
The light that I had only glimpsed through a type of fog became
brighter. I then began to recognize my state and understood that
I no longer belonged to the terrestrial world. If I had not known
Spiritism, the illusions would have undoubtedly been prolonged
for quite some time.
       “My mortal remains had not yet been buried. I regarded them
with respect, although I felt happy at having been disencumbered
of them. I was so happy at being free! I was breathing with the ease
of someone who has just emerged from a suffocating atmosphere,
and an indescribable sensation of bliss impregnated my entire being.
The presence of individuals whom I used to love filled me with joy
and I was not surprised at seeing them. It seemed quite natural, as
if I were seeing them again after a long voyage. One thing surprised
me right at first: the fact that we understood each other without
saying anything. We transmitted our thoughts by simply looking at
each other, as though by some sort of fluidic penetration.
       “Nevertheless, I was still not completely detached from
earthly ideas. The memory of what I had endured came back to me
from time to time to make me better appreciate my new situation.
I had suffered physically, but especially mentally. I had been the
target of malevolence, a thousand vexations that were perhaps
more painful than patently misfortunate, because they keep us in
a state of constant anxiety. This feeling had not yet disappeared
completely, and sometimes I asked myself if I was really free of
them. It still seemed like I was hearing a few unpleasant voices. I


                                209

                          Part 2 - Chapter II


often worried about the troubles these voices used to cause me and
I trembled in spite of myself. I tried to feel myself, so to speak, in
order to be assured that I was not being deceived by a dream, and
when the certainty hit me that all that had indeed ended, I felt I
had been relieved of an enormous weight. It is thus quite true – I
told myself – I am finally free of all those worries that used to
make my life a torment, and I rendered thanks to God for the fact.
I was like a poor man who had suddenly received a large fortune
and who for a long time couldn’t believe it was real, still feeling
worried about his needs. Oh, if only people could comprehend the
future life, what power, what courage it would give them amidst
adversity! What they wouldn’t do during their lifetime on earth in
order to guarantee themselves the happiness that God has reserved
for the children who have been obedient to his laws! Then they
would see how insignificant are the pleasures they envy during
their life compared to those they disdain!”
       3. Have that world – so new to you, and in light of which ours
has such little value – and the many friends whom you have rejoined
caused you to forget the family and friends you left behind on earth?
       “If I were to forget them, I would be unworthy of the
happiness I’m enjoying. God does not reward selfishness – he
punishes it. The world in which I find myself might lead me to
scorn the earth, but I could never scorn the spirits who are incarnate
there. Only amongst men and women do we see prosperity lead
to forgetting former companions in misfortune. I visit mine
often and I feel happy for the remembrances they hold of me;
their thoughts attract me to them. I watch their conversations; I
delight in their joys and their worries sadden me; however, because
I understand that their problems are only temporary and for their
own good; it’s not the kind of sadness that is full of anxiety like
that which we suffer while incarnate. I feel happy to think that
someday they will also come to this happy plane where pain is


                                 210

unknown. I am striving to help them to become worthy of it. I
am doing my utmost to suggest good thoughts to them, especially
regarding resignation, which I myself displayed before the will of
God. My greatest sadness is seeing them delay that time by their
lack of courage, their complaining, their doubts about the future,
or by any reprehensible act. Thus, I try to divert them from the
path of evil. Whenever I am successful, it is a great happiness for
me, and all of us here rejoice; whenever I fail, I sadly tell myself:
Once more, they have delayed their moment of joy. But I am
consoled when I remember that none are irredeemably lost.”

                          Van Durst
      (Former civil servant, died in Antwerp in 1863 at eighty
years of age)

       A short time after Van Durst’s passing, a medium asked his
spirit guide if he could evoke the deceased and received this reply:
       “This spirit is slowly emerging from the state of confusion.
He might be able to answer but communication would be costly
to him. I would ask you to wait four more days and then he will
be able to respond to you. Until then, he will know about the good
intentions you have expressed toward him and will come to you
gratefully as a good friend.”
       Four days later, the spirit dictated the following:
       “My friend, my life weighed very little on the scales of
eternity. Nevertheless, I am far from being unhappy. I am in a
humble situation, but relatively happy for someone who, without
striving for perfection, committed few wrongs. If creatures can be
happy within a limited sphere, very well – I am one of them. I regret
only one thing, which is that I myself did not know then what
you do now, for my state of confusion would have been shorter

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


and less difficult. In fact, that state was lengthy – feeling and not
feeling alive, seeing my body and feeling strongly connected to
it but unable to use it, seeing those whom I love and sensing the
thought that connected me to them vanish; how awful! Oh, what a
cruel time! What a moment when bewilderment takes you into its
grip and strangles you! And immediately afterward, total darkness;
feeling alive and then an instant later feel non-existent; wanting
to be aware of your self but unable to grasp it; not existing but
in a profound state of confusion sensing that you to in fact exist
nonetheless! And then, after an incalculable amount of time, a time
of suffocating anguish because you can’t comprehend it, a time
that seems unending, you are slowly reborn to a new existence.
You awaken to a new world!
       “No physical body, no earthly life, but immortal life! No men
or women of flesh, but rather light spirit forms gliding by on all sides,
circulating around you without your being able to embrace all of
them in one glance because they flutter about in the infinite! Having
space before you and being able to travel it at will! Communicating
through thought with everything that surrounds you ... my friend,
what an entirely new life! What a dazzling life! What a blessed life!
O hail! Hail to you O eternity; you have taken me into your heart!
Farewell, O earth; you kept me for so long from my true spirit
nature! No, I would not request anything else from you, for you are
the earth of exile and your greatest happiness is nothing to me!
       “But if I had only known what you know, how much easier
and pleasant the beginning of this other life would have been! I
would have already known before dying what I had to learn much
later at the moment of separation, and my soul would have freed
itself more easily. You are on the pathway, but you will never have
done too much! Tell this to my son; tell him so often that he ends
up believing and understanding, for then, when he comes here, we
will never be separated.

       “Goodbye to all of you, my friends, goodbye. I am waiting
for you, and during the time in which you remain on the earth I
will come often to learn beside you because I still do not know
as much as many of you. But I shall learn quickly here, for I no
longer endure the troubles that encumbered me or the old age that
sapped my strength. Here, we live fully and evolve, for the horizons
stretch out so beautifully before our eyes that we feel impatient to
embrace them. Goodbye; I will leave you now, goodbye.”

                          Sixdeniers
     (A morally upright man, killed in an accident and known to
the medium while alive) Bordeaux, February 11, 1861

       1. Would you provide me with a few details about your death?
       “After my drowning – yes.”
       2. Why after?
       “Because you already know what happened before.” (The
medium actually did know the details of the drowning.)
       3. So would you like to describe your sensations after death?
       “For a long time I couldn’t figure out where I was, but with
the grace of God and the help of those around me, when the light
finally became visible, I was dazzled by it. Have hope: you will
always find more than what you thought you would. Nothing
physical; everything touches the hidden senses. There is nothing
that can be touched with eyes or hands. Do you understand? It is a
spiritual surprise that surpasses your understanding because there
are no words to explain it. We can only sense it through the soul.
       “My awakening was quite pleasant. Life is one of those
dreams that, despite the dreadful idea one connects to the word,
I can only describe as having been a horrible nightmare. Imagine
that you are shut up in an infected prison, that your body is

                                213

                            Part 2 - Chapter II


being devoured by worms that pierce even your bone marrow and
that you are suspended over a flaming furnace. Imagine further
that your parched mouth doesn’t even have any air to refresh it,
that your horrified spirit only sees monsters roundabout you,
threatening to devour you. Finally, imagine everything that such a
fantastic dream can portray as the most hideous, the most horrible,
and then suddenly transport yourself to an Eden of delights. You
awaken, surrounded by all the loved ones whom you used to weep
for. See about you beloved faces that smile happily at you; breathe
the sweetest fragrances; refresh your parched throat in a spring of
pure water; feel your body lifted into infinite space, which supports
and cradles it like a breeze carrying a blossom detached from the
tree; feel yourself wrapped in the love of God like a child who at
birth is wrapped in the love of its mother. Only then will you get
an imperfect idea of the transition of death.
       “I have tried to describe the happiness of the life that awaits
men and women after the death of the body, but I’ve failed; after
all, can you describe the infinite to someone whose eyes are closed
to the light, and whose limbs could never leave the restricted circle
in which they are locked up? To describe such eternal happiness, I
say to you: Love! For only love can enable us to sense it beforehand.
And whoever means love, means the absence of selfishness.”
       4. Has your situation been happy in the spirit world from the start?
       “No. I had to pay my debt as a man. My heart had not sensed
the future of the spirit, and besides, I had no faith. I had to expiate
my indifference toward my Creator, but in his mercy he took into
account the little good that I was able to do, the pain that I endured
with resignation in spite of my suffering; his justice, which is on a
scale that people will never comprehend, weighed the good with
such kindness and love that the evil was quickly effaced.”
       5. Can you give me news about your daughter? (Who died four
or five years before her father)


                                   214

                                Happy Spirits


       “She is on a mission there on your earth.”
       6. Is she happy as an incarnate? I don’t mean to be indiscreet.
       “I know. Don’t I see your thought set before my eyes like
a picture? No, she is not happy as an incarnate. On the contrary,
all the miseries of earth life are awaiting her. But by her example
she will proclaim those grand virtues that are only fine sounding
words to you. I will help her because I must protect her. However,
she won’t have much difficulty in overcoming the obstacles. She is
not there for expiation, but a mission. So rest assured about her. And
thank you for remembering her.”
       At that moment, it became difficult for the medium to
write, and he said:
       7. If a suffering spirit is now hindering me, I ask it to sign its name.
       “An Unhappy Spirit.”
       8. Don’t you want to state your name?
       “Valerie.”
       9. Do you want to say what has caused your punishment?
       “No.”
       10. Are you repenting for your wrongs?
       “You can see that I am.”
       11. Who brought you here?
       “Sixdeniers.”
       12. For what purpose?
       “So you might help me.”
       13. Was it you who prevented me from writing a little while ago?
       “He put me in his stead.”
       14. What is your relationship?
       “He guides me.”
       15. Ask him to join us in prayer.
       (After the prayer, Sixdeniers returned to write) “Thank you
for helping her. You have understood. I won’t forget you. Think
about her.”


                                     215

                            Part 2 - Chapter II


       16. (Asked of Sixdeniers) As a spirit, do you have a lot of
suffering spirits to guide?
       “No. But as soon as we succeed in leading one back to the
moral path, we are shouldered with another, without, however,
abandoning the first ones.”
       17. How can you manage a supervision that could multiply
infinitely across the centuries?
       “You must understand that those whom we lead back to the
moral path eventually evolve and purify themselves. Thus, they
are less work for us. At the same time, we ourselves evolve and in
doing so, our own faculties develop and our abilities broaden in
proportion to our purity.”
       Less evolved spirits are therefore assisted by good spirits who
are charged with the mission of guiding them. This task is not
devoted exclusively to incarnates, who should also take part in it
because it is a means for them to progress. When a less evolved spirit
interferes during a good communication – as in this case – it of
course does not always do so with good intentions. However, good
spirits may allow it to do so, whether as a test or as a way for those
present to perhaps help it improve itself. It is true that its persistence
could degenerate into obsession, but the more tenacious it becomes,
the greater the proof that it really needs assistance. It is wrong to
turn away such a spirit. We must regard it as a poor creature who
has come to beg alms, and we must remind ourselves that it is an
unhappy spirit who has been sent by good ones in order for us to
instruct it. If we succeed, we will experience the joy of having set a
soul on the path of the good, thereby shortening its suffering. This
task is often arduous. Of course, it would be more pleasant always
to receive good communications and converse only with the spirits
of our own preference. However, we deserve the protection of good
spirits not by seeking to satisfy our own desires, but by not turning
away the occasions that offer us an opportunity to practice the good.

                        Dr. Demeure
           (Died in Albi (Tarn) on January 25, 1865)

       Dr. Demeure was a well-regarded homeopathic physician
in Albi. His character and wisdom won him the esteem and
veneration of his fellow citizens. His kindness and charity were
inexhaustible. In spite of his advanced age, he never became
tired when administering his care to the poor. Payment for
his visits was what mattered least to him. He regarded himself
as less inconvenienced by his poorer clients than by the ones
whom he knew could pay him. He said that this was because
the latter could always find another doctor in his absence. He
not only gave his poorer clients prescriptions and medicine
without charge, but he often added what was necessary to
provide for their physical needs as well, which is sometimes the
most effective medicine. We might say that he was a “priest of
the medical arts.”
       Dr. Demeure ardently embraced the Spiritist Doctrine,
in which he found the key to the most serious problems that he
had fruitlessly sought for in science and every philosophy. His
profound and investigative spirit immediately comprehended the
full scope of the Doctrine and he became one its most zealous
proselytizers. A most lively and mutually sympathetic relationship
was established between us through correspondence.
       We found out about his death on January 30. Our first
thought was that of obtaining a communication from him, which
he provided for us on the same day:
       “I’m here. When alive, I promised myself that when I died I
would come, if possible, to ‘shake hands’ with by dear teacher and
friend, Mr. Allan Kardec.
       “Death plunged my soul into that heavy sleep called lethargy,
but my mind kept watch. I shook off the dismal torpor that


                                217

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


prolongs the state of confusion after death and woke up, making
the crossing in a single bound.
      “How happy I am! I am no longer either infirm or old.
My body was only a garment imposed on me. I am now young
and handsome with that eternal, youthful beauty of the spirits,
whose faces are never marked with wrinkles and whose hair never
becomes gray with the passage of time. I’m light like a bird that
rapidly flies across the horizon of your cloudy sky. And I marvel,
contemplate, bless, love and bow – atom that I am – before the
grandeur, wisdom and knowledge of our Creator, and before the
wonders that surround me.
      “I am blissful, I am in glory! Oh, who could ever describe
the splendid beauties of the land of the elect: heavens, worlds and
suns and their role in the great concourse of universal harmony?
Yet, my teacher, I shall try. I will undertake these studies and shall
return to deposit at your feet the efforts of my labors as a spirit,
and which I dedicate to you beforehand. So long!”
                                                            Demeure

        The following two communications of February 1 and 2
are related to the illness that had beset me at that time. Although
the communications are personal, I have reproduced them here
because they show that Dr. Demeure continues to be as good as a
spirit as he was as a man.
        “My good friend, trust us and take heart. Although this
crisis is tiring and painful, it will not last long. With the prescribed
treatment, and depending on your desire, you will soon complete
the work which is the principal objective of your life. I am always
here at your side with the Spirit Truth, who allows me to speak in
his name. Because I am the most recent among your friends who
have crossed over to the spirit world, the others have allowed me
the honors. Dear teacher, how happy I am at having died in time


                                  218

                            Happy Spirits


to be with them at this moment! If I had died earlier, perhaps
I could have prevented this unforeseen crisis. My discarnation,
however, was so recent that I was unable to concern myself with
anything but matters of the spirit, but now I shall watch over you,
dear teacher. I am your brother and friend, and I feel happy at
being a spirit in order to be at your side, taking care of you in
your illness. But you know the proverb: ‘Heaven helps those who
help themselves.’ So help the good Spirits in their care for you and
follow their prescription exactly.
      “It is very hot in here. That coal fire makes you tired. Don’t
burn any more coal while you are ill; it increases your difficulty in
breathing. The gases it releases are harmful.”
      Your friend, Demeure
      “It’s me, Demeure, Mr. Kardec’s friend. I have come to tell
him that I was with him when he survived the accident that could
have been disastrous without the timely intervention that I had
the happy fortune to assist. According to my observations and
information gathered from a good source, it seems to me that the
sooner he discarnates, the sooner he will reincarnate, which will
enable him to finish up his work. However, before departing he
must finish the works that will complete the doctrinal system of
which he is the initiator. And he would be guilty of intentional
suicide if, through excessive work, he were to contribute to
the breakdown of his organism, which threatens to bring him
suddenly to our world. You must not be afraid to tell him the
whole truth of the matter so that he may be on guard and follow
our prescriptions to the letter.”
                                                           Demeure

       The following communication was received in Montauban
on January 26 – the day following his death – in the circle of his
Spiritist friends in that town:


                                219

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


       “Antoine Demeure. I have not died for you, my good
friends, but only for those who do not yet know as you do this holy
Doctrine that unites all those on earth who love one another, all
those who are of the same mind and who have the same sentiments
of love and charity.
       “I am happy, happier than I could hope, for I am enjoying a
lucidity that is quite rare among spirits who have so recently been
delivered from matter. Take heart, my good friends. I will always
be with you and will not fail to instruct you about things of which
we are ignorant when we are connected to our poor material body,
as it hides so many splendors and prevents so many joys. Pray for
those who are deprived of this happiness, for they do not know the
wrong they are committing against themselves.
       “I cannot stay long today, but I wanted to tell you that I do
not feel completely foreign to this world of invisible beings; it almost
seems like I have always dwelt here. I am happy because I see my
friends here and can communicate with them whenever I want to.
       “Do not weep, my friends. That would make me regret
having known you. With the passing of time, God will bring you
also to this plane where all of us will be together again. Good
night, my friends. May God comfort you. I am with you.”
                                                             Demeure

       Another letter from Montauban contained the following
account:
       Due to her extreme sensitivity, we kept Dr. Demeure’s
death from Mrs. G., who is a seeing medium and a very lucid
somnambulist. Obviously understanding our intentions, the good
doctor avoided manifesting himself to her. Last February 10, we
were gathered at the invitation of our guides, who said they wanted
to relieve Mrs. G. of the sprained ankle that had been causing
her great misery since the preceding day. We knew nothing of


                                  220

                           Happy Spirits


the matter and were far from anticipating the surprise that our
guides had in store for us. As soon as this woman went into the
somnambulistic state, she began to scream violently, pointing to
her foot. This is what happened:
       Mrs. G. saw a spirit, whose face remained hidden, bending
over her leg. This spirit rubbed and massaged it, at times
making a longitudinal motion exactly as any physician would
do. The procedure was so painful that the patient bawled and
writhed uncontrollably. However, the crisis soon passed. Within
ten minutes, all traces of the sprain and its inflammation had
disappeared, and her foot had returned to its normal appearance.
Mrs. G. had been healed.
       However, the spirit remained unknown to Mrs. G. and
insisted on not showing its face to her. It seemed as though it
wanted to leave, when Mrs. G., who only a few minutes earlier
could not even take a step, leapt to the middle of the room to
shake hands with her spirit doctor. Again, the spirit kept its face
turned away, leaving only its hand in hers. At that moment, she
cried out and fainted to the floor. She had recognized Dr. Demeure
as her spirit healer. While she was unconscious, she received the
careful attention of several sympathetic spirits. Finally, when she
had returned to lucid somnambulism, she talked with them and
exchanged warm greetings with them, especially with the spirit
doctor, who responded to her displays of affection by enveloping
her in restorative fluids.
       Isn’t this scene striking and dramatic; doesn’t it give us
the impression that we are watching all these various personages
performing their roles as they would in human life? Doesn’t it
comprise one more proof among so many others that spirits are
real beings, endowed with bodies and acting as though they were
still on the earth? We were happy to meet our spirit friend, with
his same excellent heart and delicate kindness. During his life, he


                               221

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


had been the medium’s physician. He knew about her extreme
sensitivity and treated her like his own daughter. Isn’t this proof of
identity – granted to those whom this spirit used to love – striking
and at the same time enough to make us view the future life from
a more comforting point of view? [End of account]
        Dr. Demeure’s situation as a spirit is exactly what we might
expect because of his worthy and useful life while on earth. However,
a no-less instructive fact highlights these communications: the
activity he becomes involved in almost immediately after his death
in order to be useful. Due to his refined intelligence and moral
qualities, he belongs to the order of the most advanced spirits. He
is happy, but his happiness does not consist of idleness. Only a few
days earlier he was caring for the sick as a physician; once liberated,
he rushed to care for them as a spirit. Then what good is it to go
to the other world, some will say, if one can’t rest there? We would
ask them first of all: Doesn’t the fact that we will have no more
worries or needs mean anything at all, or that we will no longer
be subject to the infirmities of human life, or the fact that we
will be free to travel space at the speed of thought without tiring,
going to see our friends at any time and at any distance no matter
where they are? Second, we would add: When you are in the other
world, no one will force you to do anything; you will be perfectly
free to remain in as beatific idleness as you want. However, you
will soon grow tired of such selfish repose and you will be the
first to ask for some sort of occupation. Then you might be told:
If you are tired of doing nothing, look around for something to
do. The opportunities for being useful are not lacking in the spirit
world, just as they are not lacking among men and women. Thus,
spirit activity does not imply any kind of coercion, but a need, a
satisfaction for spirits, who look for occupations according to their
likes and aptitudes, preferring those that can help them most in
their development.

              Widow Foulon, nee Wollis
        Mrs. Foulon, who died in Antibes on February 3, 1865,
had lived for quite some time in Havre, where she earned the
reputation as a skillful miniature painter. Her noteworthy talent
at first served her only as an enjoyable distraction. Later, however,
when she was beset with bad days, she learned to take advantage of
her craft as a precious resource. What made her especially beloved
and esteemed, what made her memory so dear to all who knew
her, was her amiable nature and her personal qualities, which only
those who knew her intimately appreciated in all their fullness.
Like all those who possess the innate sentiment of the good, she
did not flaunt her qualities – perhaps she wasn’t even aware of
them. If there was ever anyone who did not allow herself to be
dominated by selfishness, it was undoubtedly this woman. The
sentiment of personal selflessness has perhaps never been taken
so far. She was always ready to sacrifice her repose, her health and
her own interests for people for whom she could be useful. From
her youth onward, her life had been a long series of sacrifices as
well as harsh trials, in the face of which her courage, resignation
and perseverance never faltered. However, due to the painstaking
nature of her craft, her eyesight weakened day by day, so that after
some time, she was completely blind.
        When Mrs. Foulon was introduced to the Spiritist Doctrine,
it seemed to her a ray of light. It seemed that a veil had been lifted,
enabling her to see something that was not foreign exactly, but about
which she had had only a vague intuition. She studied it ardently,
endowed with that lucidity of spirit and rightness of judgment
that were proper of her elevated intelligence. One would have to
know about all the perplexities of her life – perplexities that never
pertained to her own life per se, but to the lives of those whom she
loved – in order to understand how much consolation she found in


                                 223

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


the sublime revelation that provided her with an unshakable faith in
the future and showed her the emptiness of earthly things.
       Her death was as dignified as her life. She felt it drawing near
without any baleful apprehension. For her, it was a deliverance from
earthly ties that would open to her the spiritual and blessed way
with which she had identified herself by studying Spiritism. She
died in peace, for she was aware of having fulfilled the mission she
had accepted upon coming to the earth and of having scrupulously
accomplished her duties as a wife and mother; also because
during her life she had avoided any resentment toward those who
offended her and those who had repaid her with ungratefulness.
She always repaid evil with good and left life forgiving everyone in
order to hand herself over to the goodness and justice of God. She
finally died with the peacefulness of a pure conscience and certain
that she would be no less separated from her children than during
corporeal life, since she could still be with them in spirit wherever
they might be on the globe in order to help them with her counsels
and to cover them with her watch care.
       When we first heard about Mrs. Foulon’s death, our initial
desire was to converse with her. The friendly and sympathetic
relationship that the Spiritist Doctrine aroused between us explains
a few of her expressions and her casual language.

                           I
    (Paris, February 6, 1865, three days after death)

       “I was certain that you would evoke me soon after my
liberation and I was ready to answer, for I didn’t experience any
state of confusion. Only those who are terrified and surrounded by
the constricting darkness of fear become confused.
       “Well, my friend, I’m happy now. These poor eyes, which
had become weakened and only kept a memory of the sights that


                                  224

                             Happy Spirits


had colored my youth with their glimmering luminosity, have
been reopened here and have rediscovered the splendid horizons
that some of your great artists idealize in their pale reproductions,
but whose majestic reality, austere and yet full of enchantment,
comprises the most complete reality.
        “It has been only three days since I passed away and I already
feel like an artist. My aspirations concerning the ideal of beauty in
art were the intuition of faculties that I had studied and acquired
in other existences, and which I developed during my last one.
But what must I do in order to produce a masterpiece worthy of
the grandeur that touches my spirit in this region of the light?
Paintbrushes, paintbrushes! I shall prove to the world that Spiritist
art is the crowning of pagan art, of Christian art endangered at this
time, and that to Spiritism alone is reserved the glory of reviving it
in all its splendor on your barren world.
        “But enough of the artist. Now for my friend:
        “Dear friend (Mrs. Kardec), why are you so distraught
over my death? Especially knowing what you know about the
disappointments and bitterness of my life, you should instead be
joyful at seeing that I no longer have to drink from the bitter cup
of earthly sorrows that I had to drain to the dregs. You should
believe that the dead are happier than the living; to mourn them
would be to doubt the truth of Spiritism. You will see me again; be
sure of that. I was the first to depart, because my job on that world
was over. All persons have theirs and must accomplish it while on
the earth. When yours is over, you will rest with me for a little
while. Then, we will begin again, if necessary, since it is not natural
to remain idle. All have their tendencies and follow them. This is
a supreme law that demonstrates the power of free will. So, my
good friend, be indulgent and charitable, sentiments that we all
mutually need whether in the visible world or in the invisible one.
By living according to this motto, everything will turn out well.

                          Part 2 - Chapter II


       “You would not tell me to end this conversation; however,
you know this has already been a rather lengthy first-time
communication, and that is why I will leave you now in order to
turn to my excellent friend, Mr. Kardec. I want to thank you for
the affectionate words you spoke to the friend who preceded you
to the grave – we almost left together for this world in which I find
myself, my dear friend! (An allusion to Kardec’s illness, about which
Dr. Demeure spoke). What would the dear companion of your life
had said then if the good Spirits had not helped you in time? Yes,
she would have wept and groaned, which is understandable. But
now she must see to it that you avoid exposing yourself again to
such danger before you have finished the work of initiating the
Spiritist movement. If she doesn’t, you run the risk of arriving here
among us much sooner than you should, and, like Moses, of not
seeing the Promised Land except from afar. So keep on your guard;
I am warning you as a friend.
       “I shall leave now. I want to return to my dear children.
Then, I’m going beyond the seas to see if my wandering sheep
has finally arrived in port or if she is at the mercy of a storm (one
of her daughters used to live in America). May the good Spirits
protect her. I am going to rejoin them for that purpose. I will
return to converse with you, for I am an untiring talker, as you will
certainly recall. Until then, my good and dear friends, so long.”
                                                      Widow Foulon

                              II
                      (February 8, 1865)

       My dear Mrs. Foulon, I was very pleased with your communication
the other day and your promise to continue conversing with us.
       I realized perfectly well that it was in fact you who were
communicating. You spoke about things that the medium could not


                                 226

                             Happy Spirits


possibly have known about, and which could have only come from
you yourself. Furthermore, your affectionate language toward us was
certainly that of your loving soul. And in your words there was a
certainty, a balance and a firmness that I did not perceive during your
life. You will recall that I allowed myself to admonish you more than
once on certain occasions.
        “That is true, but since the time I became seriously ill, I have
recovered the firmness of spirit that I had lost due to the sorrows
and vicissitudes that at times made me feel apprehensive about life.
I said to myself: you are a spirit; forget the earth; prepare yourself
for the transformation of your being. Through your thought, see
the illumined pathway that your soul must follow upon leaving
your body, and which will lead it, happy and free, to the celestial
spheres where you must live from hereon out.
        “You might think that I was a bit presumptuous in counting
on perfect happiness upon leaving the earth behind, but I had
suffered so much that I felt I surely must have expiated all my
wrongs of that lifetime and the previous ones. That intuition did
not delude me; rather, it was what gave me courage, tranquility
and firmness during my final moments. Such firmness naturally
increased when, after my liberation, I saw my hopes realized.”
        Would you mind describing to us your passage, your awakening
and your first impressions?
        “Indeed, I did suffer, but my spirit was stronger than the
physical suffering which the disengagement made it endure.
After my last breath, I passed through a sort of syncope, losing
consciousness of my condition, not perceiving anything, in a
vague somnolence which was neither the sleep of the body nor
the awakening of the soul. I remained like that for quite some
time. Afterward, as if I were emerging from a long fainting spell,
I awoke little by little and found I was surrounded by friends
whom I did not recognize. They lavished care and attention on


                                  227

                            Part 2 - Chapter II


me. They showed me a point in space that resembled a shining
star and said, ‘You are going there with us, for you no longer
belong to the earth.’ Then I remembered. I was aided by them
as we formed a graceful group rushing toward realms unknown.
With the certainty of finding happiness, we rose and rose and the
star grew bigger and bigger in front of us. It was a happy world,
a higher world on which your good friend was going to finally
find rest; I mean rest with respect to the bodily fatigue that I had
endured and the vicissitudes of earthly life; not idleness of spirit,
for spirit activity is a source of enjoyment.”
       So you left earth forever?
       “I left behind too many loved ones to have abandoned them
forever. I will return in spirit, for I have a mission to fulfill together
with my children. You know good and well that no obstacle can
oppose the visit of spirits from worlds that are superior to earth.”
       Doesn’t your current situation seem to weaken your relationships
with those you have left behind on this world?
       “No, my friend, love draws souls together. Believe me, you can
be on the earth and be closer to those who have attained perfection
than to those whose inferiority and selfishness make them whirl
around the terrestrial sphere. Charity and love are the two drives
behind a powerful attraction. They form a tie which binds the
union of souls, and which continues regardless of distance and
place. There is distance for physical bodies only but not for spirits.”
       What is you opinion now about my efforts regarding Spiritism?
       “I find that you are a missionary and that your burden is heavy,
but I also see the goal and know you will reach it. I will help you as
much as I can with my spirit counsels so that you may overcome all
the difficulties you meet. I will suggest certain appropriate measures
to take during your life regarding the movement of renewal brought
by Spiritism. Your friend Demeure, together with the Spirit Truth,
will be more useful still, since he is wiser and more capable than I. But


                                   228

                              Happy Spirits


since I know that the assistance of the good Spirits is strengthening
and sustaining you in your work, you may be assured that I can
guarantee you my help anywhere and at any time.”
       From some of what you have stated, one might deduce that you
will not take a highly personal and active part in the work of Spiritism.
       “You are mistaken. It’s just that I see so many other spirits
who are more capable than I am at addressing such an important
matter; hence, a sentiment of invincible timidity prevents me at
present from responding to you as you would wish. Perhaps in
time I will be more courageous and bold, but it is necessary that
I get to know these spirits better. After all, it has only been four
days since my death and I am still dazzled by everything around
me. My friend, don’t you understand? I’m not able to express the
new sensations I’m experiencing. I need to strengthen myself in
order to overcome the allure that these marvels hold; for now, I
can only worship and give thanks to God for his works. But this
allure will pass. The Spirits have assured me that I will soon grow
used to all these magnificent things, and then with my lucidity as
a spirit I will be able to deal with all the issues regarding earth’s
renewal. Meanwhile, remember that at the moment, especially, I
have a family to console.
       “Goodbye for now. I will see you soon. Your good friend
loves you and always will, my teacher, because you provided her
with the only lasting and true consolation she had while on earth.”
                                                        Widow Foulon

             (This communication was given to
                her children on February 9)

      “My children, my loved ones, God has taken me from you
but the recompense he has granted me is very great when compared

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


with the little I did while on the earth. Resign yourselves, my good
children, before the designs of the Most High. Draw the strength
to support the trials of your lives from all that he has allowed you to
receive. Always hold firm in your hearts that belief which made my
passing so easy from earthly life to the life that awaits us when we
leave that inferior world. God extended his inexhaustible goodness
to me after my death, just as he did when I was still on the earth.
I give him thanks for all the benefits he has granted you. Bless
him, my children; bless him always and at all times. Never lose
sight of the goal that has been shown to you or the route that you
must follow. Think of your use of the time God has granted you
on the earth. You will be happy, my dear ones; you will be happy
if you remain united. You will be happy with your own children if
you instruct them on the path of the good, the path that God has
allowed to be revealed to you.
        “You cannot see me, but you can be sure that the tie that
bound us together on earth was not broken with the death
of my body, because it was not the body that connected us,
but the spirit. That is why, my dear ones – thanks to the
goodness of the Almighty – I will be able to guide you still,
and encourage you in your progress so that we can be with
one another again later.
        “Press on, my children; cultivate that sublime belief with the
same love. Good days are reserved for you who believe. This has
already been told to you, but it was not for me to see such days on
earth. It is from higher up that I will appreciate those happy times
promised by our good, just and merciful God.
        “Please don’t weep, by children. May these communications
strengthen your faith and your love for God, who has given you so
many gifts and who so many times sent help to your mother. Pray
at all times; prayer will strengthen you. Abide by the teachings I so
ardently followed during the life God granted me.

       “I will return to you, my children, but for now I must go help
my other poor daughter, who still needs me so much. Goodbye, I
will see you again soon. Believe in the goodness of the Almighty. I
am praying for you. Goodbye.”
                                                     Widow Foulon

       Any serious and enlightened person will easily see the
instruction that may be derived from these communications, but
we will nonetheless call attention to a couple points. The first is
the fact that this example shows us the possibility that it might
not be necessary to reincarnate on the earth, but that we may
instead pass from it to a higher world without becoming separated
from the loved ones we have left behind. Thus, those who fear
reincarnation because of the difficulties of life here can avoid such
fear by working hard to improve themselves. It is like someone
who does not want to stagnate in a lower position and who must
therefore learn and work to attain a better one.
       The second point is the confirmation of the principle that
after death we are less separated from our loved ones than during
life. Mrs. Foulon, who by old age and illness was confined to a tiny
town in the south, had only a part of her family nearby. Most of
her children and friends were scattered far away in such a manner
that physical obstacles kept her from seeing them as frequently as
she desired. The great distances made even corresponding with
some of them rare and difficult. However, she had barely departed
her body before she could lightly run to be with any one of them,
overcoming distances without fatigue and at the speed of light.
She could then see them, watch their family gatherings, become
involved in protecting them, and through a medium she could
converse with them at any time as if she were still alive. And to
think there are people who prefer an indefinite separation to such
a consoling idea!

                   A Russian Physician
       Mr. P. was a physician from Moscow, as distinguished for his
eminent moral qualities as he was for his knowledge. The individual
who evoked him knew him only by reputation but had not had
any direct relationship with him. The original communication was
given in Russian.
       (After the invocation) Are you here?
       “Yes. On the day of my death I came to you, but you resisted
all my attempts to get you to write. I heard what you said about
me, and that enabled me to become acquainted with you. I then
had the desire to converse with you and to be useful.”
       Since you were such an upright individual, why did you
suffer so much?
       “It was an act of grace from the Lord, who in such a manner
wanted to enable me to advance as much as possible while on that world
and to enable me to feel the value of my final deliverance from it.”
       Did the thought of death frighten you?
       “No, I had too much faith in God for that.”
       Was the separation process difficult?
       “No. What you would call my last moment was nothing. I
only felt a very quick jolt, and soon afterward found myself very
happy at having become disencumbered of my miserable carcass.”
       Then what happened?
       “I had the fortune of seeing a large number of friends who
had come to meet and welcome me, especially those whom I had
had the satisfaction of helping.”
       What region are you in? Are you on some planet?
       “Surrounding the planets there is what you call space. That is
where I am, but how many gradations there are in this immensity;
men have no idea! How many rungs there are on this Jacob’s ladder
that goes from earth up to heaven; that is, from the abasement of


                                 232

                             Happy Spirits


incarnation on a lower world such as yours up to the complete
purification of the soul! One does not come to where I am now
except after many trials, meaning many incarnations.”
       So you must have had many existences.
       “How could it be otherwise? There are no exceptions to the
immutable order set by God. The reward can only be given after
victory has been won in the struggle. And when the reward is large,
it necessarily means that the struggle must have been considerable
too. But human life is so short that the struggle is fulfilled only in
stages, and such stages are the many successive existences. Now
that I am at on a higher rung, it is obvious that I have attained this
happiness through a succession of battles in which God sometimes
allowed me victory.”
       What does your happiness consist of?
       “That is more difficult to explain. The happiness I’m
experiencing is an extreme self-contentment, not as a result of my
merits, which would be pride – and pride is a mark of backward
spirits – but a contentment that entails being immersed in God’s
love and the realization of his infinite goodness. It is the profound
joy of seeing the right and the good, of being able to say: Perhaps I
have contributed to the betterment of a few individuals who have
lifted themselves up to the Lord. I feel as though I am one with
happiness; it is a sort of fusion between the spirit and the divine
good. I have the gift of seeing the purest spirits, of understanding
their missions and knowing that I will also attain that state. In the
incommensurable infinite, I can glimpse regions so resplendent
with the divine fire that they dazzle me when I contemplate them
through the veil still covering them. But what am I saying? Can
you comprehend my words? That fire of which I speak: do you
believe that it is like the fire of the sun, for example? No, no. It is
something inexpressible to men, for words express objects only,
physical or metaphysical matters about which they have a memory,


                                 233

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


or an intuition. But since they have no memory whatsoever of what
is completely unknown to them, they have no words available that
can enable them to perceive it. However, know that it is already an
immense joy in thinking that we can evolve forever.”
        You were so kind as to state that you wanted to be of some use to
me. In what way, may I ask?
        “I can help you in your moments of discouragement,
strengthen you in your weaknesses and console you in your sorrows.
If your faith is shaken by some kind of trouble and you feel perplexed,
call me. God will give me the words needed to remind you of him
and lead you back to him. If you feel ready to succumb under the
weight of tendencies that your conscience feels are incorrect, call
me. I will help you bear your cross just as Jesus was helped to bear
his – the cross which so mightily proclaims truth and charity. If
you weaken under the weight of your sorrows, if despair seizes you,
call me. I will come to lift you out of the abyss, speaking spirit to
spirit, reminding you of the duties imposed on you, not because of
societal or material considerations, but because of the love that you
will sense in me, the love that God has dispensed to my being in
order to transmit it to those whom he can save.
        “Of course, you have friends on earth. Perhaps they have
shared in your troubles, and perhaps they have already saved you
on occasion. During times of affliction, you seek them out and
you take your regrets and tears to them, and in exchange they give
you proof of their affection through their counsels, support and
tenderness. Well then, don’t you think that a friend here might
also be a good thing? Isn’t it consoling to be able to say: When
I die, my friends on earth will be at my deathbed praying and
weeping for me, but my friends in space will be at the threshold of
my new life and will come smiling to greet me and lead me to the
place that I have merited by my virtue?”
        Why have I deserved the protection you want to give me?


                                  234

                               Happy Spirits


        “Because I have felt an attachment to you since the day of
my death. I have seen you as a Spiritist, a good medium and a
sincere adherent. Among all those I left below, I perceived you
first, so I have decided to contribute to your progress, not only
in your own interest but also in the interest of all whom you have
called to the path of the truth. You can see that God loves you
so much that he has made you a missionary. All those about you
will gradually share in your beliefs. Even the most rebellious will
at least listen to you, and one day you will see that they too will
believe. Do not give up. Always press forward despite the obstacles
along the way. Take me as your support if you feel discouraged.”
        I wouldn’t dare believe myself worthy of such a big favor.
        “You are obviously far from perfection, but your ardor in
spreading good teachings, your sustaining of the faith of those who
hear you, your proclamation of charity, goodness and benevolence –
even when someone does not behave properly toward you – your
resistance to the impulses of anger that you could easily give in to
against those who afflict or belittle your intentions – all these attributes,
fortunately, act as a counterweight to the evil still in you. And know
that forgiveness of offenses is a powerful mitigating force against evil.
        “God has covered you with his grace through the faculty he has
given you and it is up to you to develop it through your own efforts
in order to work effectively for the salvation of your neighbor. I am
leaving you for now, but you can count on me. Try to moderate your
earthly ideas and live more frequently with your friends on this side.”
                                                                           P.

provide my family with an insufficient piece of bread. Nonetheless,
I loved my true Master, and whenever the One who was watching
over me on earth increased the burden of my misery, I would say:
My God, give me strength to bear this weight without complaint.
I expiated my wrongs, my friends, and upon leaving that harsh
trial, the Lord received me into his peace. My most earnest desire
is to gather all of you around me, my children and brothers, and
to tell you: Whatever the price you may be paying while on earth,
the happiness that awaits you is much greater.
        “I never had regular employment. I was a child in a large
family and served anyone who could help me earn my livelihood. I
was born in an era in which servitude was cruel and I bore all sorts
of injustices, all the burdens and excesses that my master’s subalterns
pleased to impose on me. I saw my wife violated and my daughters
seduced and then cast aside, without any right to complain about
it. I saw my sons taken off to wars of pillage and crime, and then
hanged for wrongs they had not committed! Ah! If you only knew,
my poor friends, what I endured during such a long lifetime! But I
waited, I waited for the happiness that cannot be found on earth,
and which the Lord finally bestowed upon me. Therefore, for all of
you, my friends, I wish courage, patience and resignation.
        “My child, you may keep what I have given you; it is a
practical teaching. Those who preach are listened to better when
they can say: I have borne up under more than you have, and I
have done so without complaining.”
        When did you live?
        “From 1400 to 1460.”
        Have you had a new existence since then?
        “Yes, I lived as a missionary amongst you. Yes, a missionary
of the faith, but of the true, pure faith – the faith that comes from
the hand of God and not the faith contrived by men.”
        Do you still have occupations as a spirit?

      “Could you possibly think that spirits are inactive? Inactivity
and uselessness would be a punishment for them. My mission is
that of guiding workers in Spiritism. I inspire them with good
thoughts and strive to neutralize thoughts suggested by evil spirits.”

                       Countess Paula
       Countess Paula was a young, beautiful and rich lady born
into an illustrious family; moreover, she was a complete model of
all the virtues of the heart and spirit. She died at age 36 in 1851.
She was one of those individuals whose eulogy can be summarized
by everyone as: Why does God take such persons so early? Happy
are those who are thus blessed by being remembered in such a
way! She was good, sweet and tolerant toward all, and was always
ready to forgive or mitigate evil rather than increase it. Slander
never stained her lips. Without being haughty or prideful, she
treated those below her with a benevolence that displayed no
menial familiarity, and she never set herself apart from them with
airs of superiority or humiliating condescension. Understanding
that those who make a living from their work are persons without
means, and that because of their condition and in order to sustain
themselves they need the money owed to them, she was never
late in paying wages. The very thought that someone might
go in want because of a late payment weighed heavily on her
conscience. She was not one of those persons who always have
money available to satisfy their own fantasies rather than to pay
their obligations. She could not understand how it could be in
good taste for the wealthy to accumulate debt, and she would
feel disgraced if anyone could have said that her suppliers had to
grant her an advance. Hence, her death brought much grief but
no claims against her.

                                 237

                                      Part 2 - Chapter II


       Her charity was inexhaustible, but not that conventional
charity that puts on a show in the full light of day. It was a charity
of the heart and not of ostentation. Only God knew about the tears
she wiped away and the desperation she relieved, for her good acts
were only witnessed by herself and the misfortunates she assisted.
She especially knew how to find hidden misfortunates. These were
the most desperate and she helped them with a delicacy that raises
rather than lowers self-esteem.
       Her social status and her husband’s high position obligated
her to perform onerous household roles from which she could
not excuse herself. However, in order to completely satisfy the
requirements of her position without being stingy, she did so with
great orderliness and managed to avoid ruinous wastefulness and
superfluous expenditures, thereby enabling her to reduce by half
what others might have spent without doing nearly as well.
       She was thus able to save a large part of her fortune for the
needy. Having destined a large share of her resources exclusively
for this purpose so sacred to her, she regarded it as a reduction in
what she would otherwise spend on the upkeep of her household.
Hence, she found a way of reconciling her societal duties with her
duties toward the needy.63
       Evoked twelve years after her death by a relative who had
accepted Spiritism, she gave the following communication,
responding to several questions asked of her.64
       “You are right, my friend, in thinking that I am happy.
Actually, I am happy beyond anything you could imagine despite
my being still far from the highest plane. I used to belong to
earth’s fortunate ones, for I don’t recall having experienced any
real sorrow. Youthfulness, health, wealth, praise – I had everything

     Gospel according to Spiritism, chap. XIII – Auth.

     From this communication (given in German) were taken the topics of interest to our
     subject, leaving family matters aside.

that comprises happiness among you. But what is such happiness
compared to what may be experienced here? What are your most
splendid galas – where people display the most valuable jewels –
when compared to the assemblies of spirits who shine with a light
that your eyes could not bear, and which is the appanage of their
purity? What are your palaces and golden halls before these aerial
dwellings, the vast field of space laced with colors that would pale
the rainbow? What are your step by step walks in the park before
the voyages through this immenseness that may be traveled faster
than lightning? What are your narrow horizons full of clouds
before the grand spectacle of worlds orbiting around in a limitless
universe under the almighty hand of the Most High? How sad and
noisy your most melodious concerts are before that soft harmony
that makes the fluids of the ether and all the fibers of the soul
vibrate! And how sad and insipid your greatest joys are before the
ineffable sensation of bliss that incessantly saturates our being like
a beneficent fragrance, without any blemish of restlessness, worry
or suffering! Here everything breathes of love, trust and sincerity.
Everywhere there are loving hearts; everywhere we see friends;
nowhere is there envy or jealousy. This is the world in which I
dwell, my friend, and to which all of you will undoubtedly arrive
by following the morally upright path.
       “One would soon tire of an unvarying happiness, however.
Don’t think that our happiness is exempt from changing suddenly.
It is neither an unending concert, a perpetual festival, nor is it
beatific contemplation for all eternity. No. It is movement, life,
activity. Although occupations cause no fatigue, they present an
incessant variety of aspects and emotions because of the thousands
of incidents they entail. Each spirit has its mission to fulfill, wards
to protect, friends to visit on earth, processes of nature to oversee,
suffering souls to console. There is a coming and going, not from
one street to another, but from one world to another. We meet,


                                 239

                         Part 2 - Chapter II


depart, and then join one another again; we assemble at a certain
point and share what we have done; we congratulate each other
on our successes; we consult and mutually assist one another with
difficult cases. Finally, I assure you that no one has even a second
in which to become bored.
       “At present, the earth is our main concern. What activity
among spirits! What a multitude of spirits rushing toward the
earth to take part in its transformation! They are like a legion of
workers occupied with clearing a forest under the command of
experienced foremen. Some chop down the old trees with an axe;
some pull up deep roots; others clear the land; these plow and sow
the soil; those erect a new city upon the smoldering ruins of the
old world. Meanwhile, the leaders meet, hold council and send
messengers with their orders in every direction. The earth must
be regenerated within a certain time; the designs of Providence
must be accomplished. That is why everyone is at work. Don’t
think that I myself am only a spectator of this great work. I would
feel ashamed if I were to remain idle while everyone else was busy.
An important mission has been entrusted to me and I am making
every effort to fulfill it in the best way possible.
       “I did not arrive at my present position in the spirit life
without a struggle. Rest assured that no matter how meritorious
my last existence might have seemed it would not have been
enough. Over many lifetimes I passed through the trials of labor
and poverty, which I had voluntarily chosen in order to strengthen
and purify my soul. I had the pleasure of emerging victorious
from those trials, but I had yet to undergo one more – the most
dangerous of all: wealth and material well-being, a well-being
without any bitterness. That is what comprised the danger. Before
attempting it, I desired to feel strong enough not to succumb. God
took into account my good intentions and granted me enough
grace to uphold me. Many spirits are seduced by appearances and


                                240

                                     Happy Spirits


rush to choose wealth. What disgrace befalls them! Too weak to
confront the dangers of wealth, they allow material seduction to
triumph over them in their inexperience.
        “Workers! I am in your ranks. Like you, I, the noblewoman,
earned my bread with the sweat of my brow. I suffered privations and
passed through harsh times, and that is how I developed the virile
forces of my soul. If I hadn’t, I would have undoubtedly failed at my
last trial, which would have put me far behind. Like me, you will
also have to go through the trial of wealth, but don’t rush to ask for
it too soon. You, who are already wealthy, always keep in mind that
true fortune, imperishable fortune, cannot be found on the earth, and
understand at what price you can merit the grace of the Almighty.”

luminous torrent, carrying along in its immense course souls
athirst for the infinite! After breaking my bonds of flesh, my eyes
beheld new horizons surrounding me and I drank in the splendid
marvels of the infinite. I passed through the shadows of matter to
the scintillating dawn that proclaims the Almighty. I have been
saved, not because of the merits of my works, but because I knew
the eternal principle that enabled me to avoid the stains cast upon
poor humankind by ignorance. My death was a blessing. My

the holy cause of Spiritism. My work was finished. My predecessors
have followed its course. I had reached that culminating point at
which a man has given his best and would do nothing but repeat
himself. My death has rekindled the attention of the learned and
has brought back my main opus, which addresses the Spiritist issue
which they pretend to ignore, but which will soon enwrap them.

new Doctrine, I shall be one of the pioneers who blaze your trail.”

                 spontaneous communication)

       The spirit responds to a thought formulated about his unexpected
death at a young age, and which had surprised many people:
       “Who told you that my death would be of no benefit to Spiritism,
its future and development? My friend, have you noticed the line of
progress the Spiritist faith has taken? First, God granted the physical
proofs: the dance of the tables, the raps and all that sort of phenomena.
These were meant to call attention to the matter and were an entertaining
preface to it. People needed tangible evidence in order to believe; now,
however, it is quite different! After the physical evidence, God began
to speak to the mind, to commonsense and to cool reason – no longer
through amazing phenomena but through rational things that ought to
convince and attract even the most obstinate disbeliever. And still, that
was only just the beginning. Pay close attention to what I am saying:
a whole series of intelligent and irrefutable phenomena are about to
occur and the already great number of followers of the Spiritist faith will
increase further. God is going to take over the minds of the elite, the
highest of intellect, talent and knowledge. It will be a shining radiance
that will expand over the whole earth like an irresistible fluid, and it will

push the most recalcitrant to research the infinite, to the study of this
wonderful science that teaches us such sublime maxims. All will gather
around you, and regardless of any learned title they may have been
conferred with, they will become humble and small in order to learn
and be convinced. Later on, when they have been sufficiently taught
and convinced, they will use their authority and their famous names to
advance the cause even further and to reach the final limits of the goal
that has been proposed to you: the regeneration of humankind through
a rational and profound understanding of past and future existences.
This is my sincere opinion about the current state of Spiritism.”

                            In Bordeaux

        (Evocation) “I am very pleased to answer your call, ma’am.
Yes, you are right; I did not experience the state of confusion per se
(this is in response to the medium’s thought). I had been in voluntary
exile on your earth and was charged with casting the first serious
seed of the great truths that are enveloping the world at this time.
I always kept in mind an awareness of my homeland and quickly
felt at home amongst my brothers.”
        I thank you for having wanted to come, but I had no idea
that my wish to converse with you had exerted such an influence. The
difference between us must be so great that I can only be in awe of it.
        “Thank you for such kind thoughts, my daughter, but you
must also know that whatever may be the distance that separates
us as a result of well or not so well-completed trials, there is always
a powerful tie that unites us: affinity. And this tie has become
stronger through the constancy of your thought.”
        Although many spirits have explained their first sensations upon
awakening, would you be so kind as to tell me what you experienced
after becoming aware of your situation and how the separation between
your spirit and body occurred?

        “In the same way as for everyone else. I felt the moment
of my liberation drawing near, but I was happier about it than
many because there was nothing to cause me any anxiety. I had
already known about its consequences, although they were more
impressive than I thought they would be. The body clouds the
spirit faculties, and no matter how enlightened the spirit may have
been before incarnating, its abilities are always to some degree
stifled by contact with matter. Thus, I went to sleep in hopes
of a happy awakening; my sleep was short, but the wonder was
immense! Before my eyes, the heavenly splendors unfolded, shining
in all their glory. My astonished sight dove into the immensities
of those worlds, whose existence and habitability I had believed
in. It was an image that was revealed to me and which confirmed
the truthfulness of my sentiments. No matter how secure men
feel, when they speak, they often have moments of doubt and
uncertainty in their hearts. If they do not doubt the truth they
proclaim, they many times, at least, distrust the imperfect means
used to demonstrate it. Convinced of the truth that I wanted to
make accepted, I frequently had to struggle with myself against my
lack of courage to see, to touch the truth, so to speak, and to be
able to render it tangible to those who were in such great need of
believing in it in order to securely follow their path.”
        Did you profess Spiritism while you were alive?
        “There is a big difference between professing and practicing.
Many people profess a doctrine but do not practice it. I practiced
it but did not profess it, in the same way that many people who
follow the law of Christ are Christian, even if they do not realize
it. One may be a Spiritist by believing in the immortal soul, its
pre-existence, its incessant progressive evolution and its earthly
trials, which are necessary ablutions for its purification. I believed
in these things and was therefore a Spiritist. I understood the
errant state – that phase of connection between incarnations – the

purgatory in which the guilty spirit rids itself of its dirty garments
in order to don new clothes, and where the evolving spirit carefully
weaves the new garments it will wear and wants to keep clean. I
understood all this, and although I didn’t profess it, I nevertheless
continually practiced it.”
       These three communications were obtained through three
different mediums who were completely unknown to each other.
The similarity of the thoughts and the form of the language allow
for at least a presumption of identity. The expression: carefully
weaves the new garments it will wear is a wonderful image that
portrays the solicitude with which the evolving spirit prepares
for a new existence, during which it must continue to progress.
Less evolved spirits are less meticulous and many make disastrous
choices that force them to start all over.

                     Antoine Costeau
       Mr. Costeau was a member of the Parisian Spiritist Society
and was buried on September 12, 1863 in a common grave in the
Montmartre cemetery. He was a man of heart, whom Spiritism
had led back to God. His faith in God was complete, sincere and
profound. He was a simple street repairer and practiced charity in
thought, word and deed in keeping with the frail resources at his
disposal, for in spite of such restrictive means, he found ways to
help those who had less than he did. If the Society did not acquire
a private tomb for him, it was because it seemed more important
to him that such money be put to better use in benefit of the
living than in the vain satisfaction of self-centeredness. Besides, we
Spiritists know better than anyone else that a common grave is a
doorway to heaven as much as any expensive mausoleum.
       Mr. Canu, the Society’s secretary and a staunch materialist
in the past, gave the following address at the graveside:

                                 245

                                     Part 2 - Chapter II


       “Dear brother Costeau: A few years ago, many of us – myself
first of all – would have seen this open grave as representing only
the end of human misery to be followed by nothingness, awful
nothingness, that is, where there is no soul to merit or expiate
anything, and, consequently, no God to reward, punish or forgive
it. Today, thanks to our holy Doctrine, we are witnessing the
end of your trials, while you, dear brother, whose remains are
returned to the earth, are realizing the triumph of your labors and
the beginning of the reward to which your courage, resignation,
charity – in a word: your virtue – entitled you, and above all, the
glorification of a wise, omnipotent, just and good God. So, dear
brother, carry our thanks to the Eternal One who has enabled us to
dissipate around us the darkness of error and disbelief, for not long
ago, and under these same circumstances, we would discouragingly
have said with gloomy faces and smitten hearts: Friend, goodbye
forever. But today we say with uplifted countenances, radiant with
hope, and with hearts full of love and courage: Dear brother, until
then, pray for us.”66
       One of the Society’s mediums obtained the following
communication right there at the still-open grave. All the
assistants, including the gravediggers, listened to its reading
with uncovered heads and profound emotion. In fact, it was a
new and startling event to hear the words of a decedent right at
the site of his own grave.
       “Thank you, friends, thank you. My grave is not yet closed,
but in a few more seconds the earth will cover up my remains. You
know, however, that my soul will not be buried in that dust, but
will hover in space and ascend to God!
       “And how consoling it is to be able to say, despite the
shattering of our envelope: Oh! I have not died; I am now living
the true life, the eternal life!”

       “The burial of the poor doesn’t involve large processions,
nor are pompous ceremonials performed at their graveside. And
yet, my friends, believe me, there is no lack of an immense crowd
here, for along with you and these pious women, the good Spirits
have accompanied the body that is lying there. At least you all have
faith and love the good God!
       “Oh! Of course, my dear wife, we do not die because our
body shatters! Furthermore, I will continue to be at your side to
console you and to help you bear your trials. Life will be rough
for you, but with the idea of eternity and the love of God in your
heart, your sufferings will be so ephemeral!
       “My relatives, you who are gathered around my beloved
wife, love her and respect her and be like brothers to her. Never
forget the mutual assistance you owe one another while on earth if
you intend to enter the dwelling place of the Lord.
       “As for you, Spiritists – brothers and friends – thank you for
having come to this home of dust and clay to bid me farewell. But
know, and know very well, that my immortal soul lives, and that
at times it will come to ask for your prayers, which you must never
refuse in order to help it in the magnificent life that you opened
up for it while on earth.
       “Goodbye to all of you. We will be able to see one another
again somewhere else besides this grave. Souls are calling me to
meet with them. Goodbye. Pray for those who suffer. Goodbye!”
                                                             Costeau

      Three days later, Costeau’s spirit was evoked in a private group
and dictated the following message through a different medium:
      “Death is life. I am doing nothing more than repeating what
has already been stated, but for you there is no other expression
than this one in spite of what the materialists believe – those who
prefer to remain blind. Oh! My friends, what a beautiful spectacle


                                 247

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


it is to see the banners of Spiritism waving upon the earth!
Spiritism is a profound, immense science about which you have
only spoken the first few words! And what light it brings to men
of goodwill, those who, having broken the terrible chains of pride,
loudly proclaim their belief in God! People, pray and give thanks
for all such benefits. Poor humanity! Ah! If only it were given to
you to comprehend! ... But no, the time has not yet come in which
the Lord’s mercy shall extend itself to all men so that they might
recognize the divine will and submit to it.
       “It is through your luminous rays, O blessed [Spiritist] science,
that they will arrive at an understanding. It is to your beneficial rays
that they will come to heat their hearts in the divine fire, the bearer
of faith and consolation. It is into your life-giving rays that master
and worker will join together and become one, for they will finally
understand that fraternal charity proclaimed by the divine Messiah.
       “Oh! My brothers, think about the immense joy to have
been the first initiates in the work of regeneration. Honor is yours,
my friends! Carry on, and someday, like myself, you will arrive at
the homeland of spirits and exclaim: Death is life. Well, it is more
like a dream, a sort of nightmare that lasts only a minute, and from
which we awaken to find ourselves surrounded by friends who
congratulate us, and who are joyful at being able to embrace us.
So great was my happiness that I could not understand why God
had granted me such grace, considering how little I had done. It
seemed like it was a dream, and since I often had dreamed that I
was dead, for a few instants I trembled at having to return to my
disgraceful body. However, it didn’t take long for me to grasp the
reality of the situation and render thanks to God. I blessed the
teacher who had known so well how to awaken me to the duties of
those who believe in the future life. Yes, I blessed him and thanked
him because The Spirits’ Book awakened within my soul the bonds
of love for my Creator.

      “Thank you, my good friends, for having brought me into
your group. Please tell our brothers that I am often with our friend
Sanson. Goodbye; have courage! Victory awaits you. Happy are
they who have taken part in the combat!”
      Since then, Mr. Costeau has manifested quite often either at
the Society or at other meetings, where he has always given evidence
of that elevation of thought that characterizes advanced spirits.

                                    Miss Emma67
       After cruel suffering, Miss Emma died as a result of an
accident caused by fire. Someone had proposed that we evoke her at
a meeting of the Parisian Spiritist Society, when she spontaneously
appeared on July 31, 1863, shortly after her death.
       “I am still here on the world scene; I who thought I had buried
myself forever in my veil of innocence and youthful. The fire of the
earth would save me from the fires of hell – thus I thought according
to my Catholic faith, and even if I had not dared to anticipate the
splendors of heaven, my timid soul would take refuge in the expiation
of purgatory. So I prayed, suffered and wept. But who in my weakness
gave me the strength to bear such anguish? Who, in the long nights
of sleeplessness and dire fever, bent over my deathbed? Who refreshed
my dry, parched lips? It was you, my spirit guide, whose white aura
surrounded me, and it was you, dear and beloved spirits, who came to
whisper words of hope and love in my ears.
       “The flames that consumed my frail body also rid me of
its chains, and thus I died while already living the true life. I didn’t
experience any state of confusion; I entered serenely and consciously
into the radiant day that embraces those who, after having suffered

     Emma Livry (September 24, 1842 - July 26, 1863) was the adopted daughter and ballerina
     protégé of Madame Taglioni. She died in Paris eight months after receiving burns when her
     costume caught fire from a gas light while rehearsing on the stage of the French Opera. – Tr.

much, know how to wait just a little longer. My mother, my dear
mother, was the last earthly vibration that resounded in my soul.
How I wish she would become a Spiritist!
       “I dropped from the earth tree like a fruit that has ripened
before its time. I had not yet been touched by the demon of pride
that stimulates misfortunate souls, carried away by the intoxicating
and shining success of youth. I bless the fire, the suffering and the
trial, which were nothing more than an expiation. Like the light
gossamer threads of autumn, I float, carried about on luminous
currents; no longer do the starry diamonds shine on my forehead,
but the golden stars of the good God.”
                                                               Emma

        On July 30, 1863, the same spirit spontaneously gave the
following communication at another Spiritist center in Havre:
        “Those who suffer while on earth receive recompense in the
other life. God is full of justice and mercy towards those who suffer
there. He grants such pure and perfect happiness that none would
fear either suffering or death if it were possible for poor human
beings to probe the mysterious designs of our Creator. But the earth
is a place of many trials and poignant pain is frequently sown there.
Be resigned if you are stricken; bow before the supreme goodness of
the omnipotent God whenever he gives you a heavy burden to bear.
If he calls you after great suffering, and if there is no complaining or
moaning in your heart, you will perceive the recompense that God
has reserved for you. You will see in the other life – the happy life –
how little the pain and suffering of earth are. I left the earth behind
quite early and God wanted to forgive me and give me the life of
those who respect his will. Always worship God; love him with all
your heart. Pray to him above all; pray to him confidently, he who is
your support while on earth, your hope, your salvation.”
                                                                 Emma

                             Dr. Vignal
       A former member of the Parisian Society, Dr. Vignal died
on March 27, 1865. On the day before his burial, a highly lucid
somnambulist and capable clairvoyant was asked to sit next to Dr.
Vignal’s body and narrate what he saw:
       “I see a corpse in which an extraordinary process is taking
place. There is a quantity of matter that is stirring and something
seems to be making an effort to disengage itself, but is having
difficulty in overcoming the resistance. I cannot make out a well-
defined spirit form.”
       An invocation was made at the Parisian Society on March 31:
       Dear Dr. Vignal, all your old colleagues from the Parisian
Society – and I in particular – have the fondest memories of you and
our meaningful relationship, which has never been interrupted. Our
reason for evoking you is primarily to express our affinity and we
would be happy if you could and would wish to communicate with us.
       “Dear friend and worthy teacher: such a fond remembrance
and displays of affinity are very pleasing to me. Thanks to your
evocation and prayers, I have been able to come today without
hindrance to attend this meeting of good friends and Spiritist
brothers. As your young secretary rightly said, I was anxious to
communicate, and since this evening I have employed all my
spirit strength to control my desire. But since the serious subjects
you have been addressing interest me very much, they made my
waiting less painful. Forgive me, my dear friend, but my gratitude
required that I manifest myself.”
       First of all, tell us how you found yourself in the spirit world.
Describe the process of separation and the sensations at that moment,
as well as the time it took you to comprehend your situation.
       “I am as happy as one can be in seeing totally confirmed all the secret
thoughts one might have had about such a comforting and consoling


                                     251

                                     Part 2 - Chapter II


doctrine. I am happy! Yes I am, because I can now see unrestrictedly
before me the future of the Spiritist science and philosophy.
       “But today let’s leave behind such importune digressions. I
will return again to converse with you about this subject, knowing
fully well that my presence brings you as much pleasure as it brings
me when I visit.
       “The separation process was quick – more than could be
hoped for because of my small merit. I was helped very much by
your assistance and your somnambulist gave you a clear enough
idea of the process of separation. I don’t have much to add. It was
a sort of intermittent oscillation, a kind of pulling in two opposite
directions. My spirit finally triumphed, for I am here. I was only
able to leave my body completely behind when it was buried; I
came here to be with you.
       What did you think about your funeral? I deemed it my
obligation to attend it. At the time, you were quite free to appreciate
it. And did the (silent) prayers I offered on your behalf reach you?
       “Yes. As I told you, your assistance helped me greatly and
I returned from the cemetery with you, completely abandoning
my old cocoon. You know that I was not concerned with material
things; I only thought about my soul and God.”
       You might recall that at your request five years ago in February
of 1860, we did a study on you while you were still alive.68 On that
occasion your spirit disengaged itself in order to come and communicate
with us. Could you describe to us, as much as possible, the difference
between your current disengagement and that one back then?
       “Yes, I recall that experiment. What a big difference there
is between my state then and this one today! During my state in
the experiment, matter still held me in its inflexible web; that is, I
wanted to but couldn’t completely disengage myself. Today I am
completely free. A vast, unknown field has opened before me and

I hope that with your help and that of the good Spirits – to whom
I commend myself – I will be able to progress and instill as quickly
as possible the sentiments I must experience and the actions I must
do to bear up under my trials and to merit recompense. What
majesty! What grandeur! It is almost a feeling of fear when, as
weak as we are, we try to gaze upon such luminous splendors.”
       We will continue our discussion of the subject whenever you want.
       “I have responded succinctly and haphazardly to several
questions. But please don’t ask too much for now from your
faithful disciple, because I am not yet completely free. I would
love to converse some more, but my guide is moderating my
enthusiasm and I have already greatly valued his goodness and
justice; thus, I submit myself entirely to his decision despite my
disappointment at having to break off our conversation for now. It
comforts me to know that at times I will be able to come to your
meetings incognito. I will communicate with you whenever I can;
I respect you and wish to show it. However, more-advanced spirits
take priority, and I must bow to those who have allowed me to give
free rein to the torrent of my accumulated thoughts.
       “I will leave you for now, my friends, and must doubly
thank not only you Spiritists who have evoked me, but also this
spirit who has allowed me to take his place, and who on earth had
the illustrious name of Pascal.”
       He who was and always will be the most devoted of your
followers,
                                                             Dr. Vignal

                        Victor Leblufe
       Mr. Leblufe, a wharf laborer at port du Havre, died at 20 years of
age. He had been living with his mother, a poor shopkeeper, on whom
he lavished the most tender and affectionate care, supporting her with

                                  253

                            Part 2 - Chapter II


the income from his toilsome work. He was never seen to frequent
taverns or to indulge in the excesses that were normal for his line of
work, for he did not wish to divert the least bit of his pay from its pious
purpose to which he had devoted himself. He dedicated all his free time
to his mother to save her from becoming tired. Struck by a long disease
from which he knew he would die, he hid his suffering so as not to
upset her and so that she would not try to take care of him instead.
The boy needed a large stock of moral qualities and strong willpower
at his passionate age in order to resist the pernicious temptations of his
environment. He was sincerely pious and his death was serene.
       On the day before his death, he insisted on his mother
taking a nap, telling her that he too needed to sleep. While she
was napping, she had a vision: she found herself in great darkness
and saw a luminous point that grew little by little until the room
became illuminated by a bright light, in which she saw the radiant
figure of her son rising up into infinite space. She understood that
his end was near and, in fact, the next day his beautiful soul left
the earth behind while murmuring a prayer.
       A Spiritist family who knew about his exemplary conduct
and who took an interest in the mother – now alone – got the idea
of evoking him shortly after his death; however, he manifested
spontaneously and gave the following communication:
       “You wish to know how I am right now; I am happy;
extremely happy! Do not take suffering and anguish into account,
because they are the origin of blessings and happiness beyond the
grave. Such happiness! You don’t understand the meaning of that
word. Earthly happiness is far from what we experience when we
return to the Master with the pure conscience and confidence of
a worker who has fulfilled his duty, and who joyfully awaits the
approval of that One who is everything!
       “Ah! My friends, life is painful and difficult if you do not
hold its true purpose before you, but I can truthfully tell you that

                            Happy Spirits


when you come to be with us – if you have followed God’s law –
you will be rewarded way beyond your suffering or the merit that
you feel you have accumulated for the life hereafter. Be good and
charitable; show that kind of charity that is unknown to many
men, and which is called benevolence. Help your neighbor and do
more for others than you do for yourself, for you may be ignorant
of their inner misery while aware of your own. Please help my
mother, my poor mother, who has been my only concern since
leaving earth. She must go through further trials but they are
necessary for her to reach heaven. Farewell; I am going to see her.”
                                                             Victor

        The medium’s Guide: “The bitter sufferings of earth do not
always comprise expiation. Spirits who, by God’s will, come to fulfill
a mission on earth – such as the spirit who has just communicated
with you – are happy to bear ills that for others would be an
expiation. Sleep reinvigorates them before the Almighty and gives
them the strength to bear everything for God’s greater glory. This
spirit’s mission during his last existence was not ostentatious, but
even though it was obscure, it was nonetheless meritorious, since
it could have come under the influence of pride. Above all, he
had a duty of gratitude to fulfill vis-à-vis the one who was his
mother; then he had to show that in the worst surroundings one
can find pure and noble souls with elevated sentiments, and who
are capable of resisting temptation. This is evidence that moral
qualities have prior causes, and his example will not have been
useless for others to follow.”

      Mrs. Gourdon, a very young woman known for her gentle
character and eminent moral qualities, passed away in November of

a circumstance that made her spiritual position quite interesting.
       Evocation
       “I’m here.”
       Your husband and your father have asked me to evoke you and
would be happy to receive a communication.
       “And I would be happy to give them one.”
       Why were you taken from your family’s affections at such a
young age?
       “Because I had finished my earthly trials.”
       Can you see your relatives sometimes?
       “Oh! I am always nearby.”
       Are you a happy spirit?
       “I am. I hope, wait and love. The heavens do not scare me, and
I await with confidence and love for the sprouting of my white wings.”
       What do you mean by white wings?
       “When I become a pure spirit as resplendent as these celestial
messengers who are dazzling me.”
       The wings of angels, archangels and seraphim, who are
nothing more than pure spirits, are obviously only an attribute
imagined by humans to portray the speed at which they move,
for their ethereal nature makes any aid unnecessary for crossing
space. However, they may appear to humans with such accessories
to be in harmony with human thought, just as spirits take on the
appearance they had on earth in order to be recognizable.
       Can your relatives do anything on your behalf?
       “They can stop saddening me with their mourning; they
know I’m not lost forever to them. I want their memory of me to
be sweet, light and fragrant. My stay on earth was like a flower’s
and nothing sorrowful should remain of that brief stay.”
       How can your language be so poetic and so little in keeping with
your position while on earth?

       “It is my soul that speaks. Yes, I possessed previously acquired
knowledge; also, God often allows delicate spirits to incarnate
amongst more rustic men to enable them to perceive the refinement
and understanding they will acquire later on.”
       Without this highly logical explanation, which is so much
in harmony with God’s kindness towards God’s creatures, it would
be difficult to understand what might at first glance seem to be an
anomaly. In reality, though, what could be more poetic and gracious
than the language of this refined young woman in the midst of the
roughest work environment? The opposite often occurs as well:
low order spirits incarnate among highly advanced peoples, but
for the opposite purpose. It is for their own advancement that God
places them in contact with an enlightened environment for their
instruction, or so that they might act as an instrument of trial.
What other philosophy could resolve such anomalies?

                     Maurice Gontran
       Maurice Gontran was an only child who died at eighteen
years of age from lung disease. He was precocious, possessed a rare
intelligence, loved to study and had a gentle, loving and likeable
character – all the qualities that foretell a brilliant future. Having
successfully completed his studies early, he then registered at the
Polytechnic School. His death caused his parents one of those
painful blows that leave deep scars, because, since he had always
been of a frail nature, they attributed his premature end to the
assiduous studies which they had urged him to undertake. They
blamed themselves, saying, “Of what use is all that he learned
now? It would have been better if he had remained uneducated,
because science did not give him what was necessary for him to
live; otherwise, he would undoubtedly still be with us and would
be a consolation for us in our old age.” However, if they had known

                                 257

                           Part 2 - Chapter II


about Spiritism, they would have reasoned differently; they would
have found true consolation. The following dictation was given
by the young man to one of his friends months after his decease.
       My dear Maurice, your tender affection toward your parents
has convinced me that you wish to lift their spirits if it is within
your means to do so. The sorrow – even despair – in which your
passing left them has visibly affected their health and has led them to
loathe their lives. A few words of consolation would certainly work
to rekindle their hope.
       “My friend, I have been waiting impatiently for this
opportunity you are now offering me to communicate. My
parents’ pain afflicts me, but it will be assuaged when they are
certain that I am not actually lost to them. Get close to them in
order to convince them of this truth, which you will certainly
manage to do. This has all happened in order to initiate them into
a belief that will bring them happiness, for it will keep them from
complaining against the decrees of Providence. You know that my
father was very skeptical regarding the future life. God granted him
this misfortune to draw him out of error.
       “We will meet again in this world, where life’s disappointments
are unknown and to where I have preceded them. However, affirm
to them categorically that the fortune of being able to see me
again will be refused as a punishment if they lack trust in God’s
goodness. It would also prevent me from further communicating
with them for the time they have remaining on the earth. Despair
is rebellion against the will of the Omnipotent and is always
punished by the prolonging of the cause that has produced it until
there is complete resignation. Despair is truly suicide, for it saps
the bodily energies, and those who shorten their days in hopes of
more quickly escaping the bitterness of pain will face the cruelest
disappointment. On the contrary, they ought to strengthen their
body so that it may more easily bear up under the burdens of trial.

                             Happy Spirits


       “My dear and kind parents, I am now addressing you. Ever
since I left my mortal remains behind, I have never left your side.
I am there even more often than when I was living. Take heart, for
I am not dead; rather, I am more alive than you. Only my body
died, but my spirit will live forever. It is free, happy and without
disease, infirmity and pain. Instead of feeling afflicted, rejoice in
knowing that I am in an environment exempt from concerns and
anxiety, and where my heart is full of the purest joy without a
shadow of trouble.
       “Oh! My good friends, do not mourn those who die
prematurely, because it is a grace that God bestows on them, saving
them from the tribulations of earthly life. My existence there did
not last long this time, because I acquired what I needed to prepare
myself for a more elevated mission. If I had lived for many years,
do you know what kinds of dangers and seductions I might have
been exposed to? Do you know that, had I succumbed to them
by not being strong enough to resist, it could have represented
for me a delay of centuries? So why do you mourn what has been
to my advantage? In a case like this, an inconsolable grief would
indicate a disbelief that is only legitimate if one holds to the idea of
nothingness. Oh! Yes, those who thus disbelieve are more worthy
of grief because for them there is no consolation possible. Their
loved ones seem to be irredeemably lost, because the grave has
robbed them of their last hope!”
       Was your death painful?
       “No, my friend, before my death I only suffered the effects
of the illness, but the suffering diminished as my final moment
approached. Then, one day I went to sleep without thinking about
death and had a marvelous dream! I dreamed that I had been
healed, that I no longer suffered. I took deep breaths of a balmy
and invigorating air. An unknown force carried me through space.
A brilliant light surrounded me but did not fatigue my sight! I


                                  259

saw my grandfather, who was no longer emaciated or feeble, but
youthful and fresh. He held out his arms to me and gathered me
close to his heart. A crowd of others, all smiling, came with him and
all benevolently and gently welcomed me. I seemed to recognize
them and felt happy to see them. We exchanged greetings and
showed our friendship for one another. Well then! What I had
supposed to be a dream was in fact reality, for I was not to awaken
from that dream on earth, but in the spirit world.”
       Then your illness was not the result of excessive study?
       “Oh, no! Please don’t think it was. The time that I was to
spend on earth had been set and nothing could have kept me
there any longer. In its moments of emancipation, my spirit knew
this and it was happy at the idea of its approaching deliverance.
However, I didn’t fail to take advantage of the time I was there,
and now I am happy for not having wasted it. My serious studying
strengthened my soul and increased its knowledge, and even
though in virtue of my short life among you I couldn’t put it to
practical use, I will do so successfully in the future.
       “Farewell, my dear friend. I am going to be with my parents
in order to prepare them to receive this communication.”
                                                                Maurice

      (Died in 1840 and evoked in Bordeaux by his granddaughter
in 1862)


The Honest Man according to God or according to Men

       1. Dear grandpa, would you please tell me how you’re doing in
the world of spirits and give me any instructive details that might be
useful for our progress?
       “Anything you want, dear child. I am expiating my disbelief,
but God’s goodness is great and he takes circumstances into
account. I am suffering, but not like you might think. I regret not
having taken better advantage of my time while on earth.”
       2. How can you say you did not employ your time well? You
always lived as an honest man.
       “Yes, in the judgment of others, but there is an abyss between
honesty before men and honesty before God. You want to learn, dear
child, so I will try to show you the difference.
       “There, among you, men are regarded as being honest
when they respect the laws of their country (a respect that is quite
flexible for many) and when they do not harm their neighbors
by ostensibly taking their property, even though they often

                                 261

                         Part 2 - Chapter III


unscrupulously rob them of their honor and their happiness as
long as the penal code or public opinion cannot reach them. They
are such blameworthy hypocrites! And when they can have their
tombstone engraved with the string of virtues they have preached,
it is believed that they have paid their debt to humanity. What a
mistake! Not breaking the laws of men is not enough before God;
above all, one must not have transgressed the divine laws.
        “A man who honest in God’s sight is one who out of devotion
and love dedicates himself to a life of goodness and to the progress
of his fellow man; who, animated by limitless zeal, is active in
life: active in fulfilling the physical tasks imposed on him, for he
must teach others the love of labor. He is active in good deeds
because he has not forgotten that he is but a servant from whom
the Lord will demand an accounting someday of how he employed
his time. Finally, he is active because he must practice love for God
and his neighbor. Thus, men who are honest before God must
carefully avoid acid words: that poison hidden under the flowers,
which destroys reputations and often ruins upright men, exposing
them to ridicule. According to God, an honest man must always
have a heart closed to any kernel of pride, envy or ambition. He
must be patient and benevolent toward those who attack him.
From the depths of his soul, without effort and especially without
ostentation, he must pardon those who offend him. He must love
the Creator in all his creatures. Furthermore, he must put into
practice that concise and grand summary of humankind’s duties:
Love God above all things and your neighbor as yourself.
        “And that, my dear child, is pretty much what honest men
must do before God. Well then, did I do all that? No. I must
confess here without blushing that I often failed at many of those
conditions; I didn’t do all the things that such an honest man
would have done. I forgot the Lord and that in turn drove me
to other wrongs, which, even though acceptable according to the


                                 262

                            Average Spirits


laws of men, were nevertheless offensive to God’s decrees. I have
suffered much since having come to understand this. That is why
I have hope now, but it is that consoling hope in the goodness of
God, who sees my repentance. My dear child, say this and repeat
it to all whose conscience is burdened: You must get rid of your
imperfections through the power of good deeds, and God’s mercy
will thereby extend over you. God’s paternal eyes will take your trials
into account and his powerful hand will obliterate your wrongs.”

                   Mrs. Helene Michel
        Mrs. Michel was a young woman of 25 years of age, who died
suddenly at home from an unknown cause and without suffering.
She was wealthy and a bit frivolous, and due to her superficial
character, she concerned herself more with the futilities of life than
with serious matters. Even so, her heart was good: she was gentle,
benevolent and charitable.
        Evoked three days after her death by individuals who had
known her, she made the following comments:
        “I don’t know where I am ... such confusion engulfs me!
You called me and I have come. I don’t understand why I’m not
at home; they are mourning my absence, but I am still there and
cannot get them to recognize me. My body no longer belongs to
me, yet I can feel it cold and frozen ... I want to leave it, yet I’m
still attached ... I always go back to it ... I’m two persons ... Oh!
When will I understand what is happening to me? I must go there
again ... my other self ... what will become of it while I’m away
from it? Goodbye.”
        The feeling of duality is obvious in this case because there
was not yet a complete separation. Her fickle character and wealth
enabled her to satisfy all her whims, and thus encouraged her
tendencies toward frivolousness. Hence, it is no wonder that her

                                 263

                         Part 2 - Chapter III


separation was slow to the point that three days after her death
she still felt tied to her corporeal envelope. However, since she had
no serious vices and deep down was a good person, this situation
was not severely distressing and did not last very long. Evoked
once more a few days later, her thoughts had already changed
considerably. This is what she had to say:
       “Thank you for having prayed for me. I have recognized
the goodness of God, who has relieved me of the suffering
and apprehension coming from the detachment of my spirit
from my body. My poor mother will have a very difficult time
resigning herself; however, she will be comforted. What to
her eyes may seem like a misfortune was meant to occur and
was indispensable so that the things of heaven might become
to her what they really should be: everything. I will be at
her side until the end of her earthly trial and I will help her
bear it. I’m not unhappy, really, but I still have much to do
to approach the state of the blessed. I will ask God to grant
that I may return to the earth, for I must make up for the
time I wasted during my last existence. May your faith uphold
you, my friends. Trust in the effectiveness of prayer, especially
when it comes from the heart. God is good.”
       Did it take you long to realize your situation?
       “I understood that I was dead the very day you prayed
for me.”
       Was the state of confusion difficult?
       “No, I didn’t suffer. I thought I was dreaming and was
waiting to wake up. My life was not without pain, because every
incarnate being in this world has to suffer. My resignation to God’s
will was taken into account. I am thankful to you for your prayers;
they helped me to come to myself. Thank you. I will be happy to
return at anytime. Farewell.”

                The Marquis de St. Paul
          (Passed away in 1860 and evoked on
         May 16, 1861 at the request of his sister,
           a member of the Parisian Society)

       1. Evocation
       “I’m here.”
       2. Your sister has asked us to evoke you, because even though she
is a medium, she has not yet developed sufficiently to have confidence
in herself.
       “I shall respond as best I can.”
       3. First, she wants to know if you are happy.
       “I’m in the errant state, and this transitory condition never
entails absolute happiness or punishment.”
       4. Did it take you a long time to come to your senses?
       “I was confused for a long time and came to my senses only
to bless the compassion of those who had not forgotten me and
who had prayed for me.”
       - Can you say how long your confusion lasted?
       “No.”
       5. Who were the relatives you recognized first?
       “My mother and father. They greeted me upon my
awakening and introduced me to the new life.”
       6. To what would you attribute the fact that during the last
moments of your illness it seemed as though you were talking with
persons who had been dear to you while on earth?
       “Before dying, I had a revelation of the world I was about to
inhabit. I was clairvoyant just before my death, but my eyes fogged
over at the moment of final separation from the body because the
fleshly ties were still quite strong.”
       7. Why did your memories involve those closer to your
childhood?

                                  265

                          Part 2 - Chapter III


       “Because the beginning of life is much closer to the end than
is the middle.”
       - How so?
       “I mean that, as if in a consoling mirage, those who are dying
remember and see their purer and younger years.”
       It is probably due to a similar providential reason that the
elderly, as they come closer to the end of their life, sometimes have
a precise remembrance of the tiniest details of their earliest years.
       8. When referring to your body, why do you always speak about
it in the third person?
       “Because I was clairvoyant, as I have already stated, and
I clearly sensed the differences between physical and mental
conditions; these differences, linked together by the vital fluid,
become highly distinguishable to the eyes of dying persons who
are clairvoyant.”
       This is a unique particularity presented by the death of this
man. During his last moments he would say, “He is thirsty and
needs something to drink; he is cold and needs to be warmed up;
he has pain in this or that part,” etc. And when someone would say,
“But it is you who are thirsty,” he would respond, “No, it’s him.”
This displays the two existences perfectly. The thinking self is in
the spirit, not in the body. This spirit, when partially detached,
regarded his body as a separate individuality and rightly said that
it did not belong to him. Thus, it was his body that needed a
drink and not his spirit. This phenomenon may also be observed
sometimes in somnambulists.
       9. What you said about the errant state of your spirit and the
duration of your confusion implies that you are not very happy, and yet
your qualities as a person would indicate quite the contrary. Moreover,
there are both happy and unhappy spirits in the errant state.
       “I am in a transitory state. Human virtues are assigned
their true value here. This state is certainly a thousand times more


                                  266

                            Average Spirits


preferable than that of my earthly incarnation. But I always aspired
to what was truly good and truly beautiful, so my soul will not feel
satisfied until it soars up to the feet of the Creator.”

                Mr. Cardon, a Physician
       Mr. Cardon had spent part of his life in the merchant marine
as a doctor on a whaling ship, where he acquired habits and ideas
that were quite materialistic. He retired to the town of J., where
he had a modest practice as a country doctor. After some time, he
became certain that he had hypertrophy of the heart, and knowing
that the illness was incurable, he sank into a state of inconsolable
melancholy at the prospect of dying. Nobody could cheer him up.
Approximately two months before his death, he actually predicted
the day on which he would die. When the time came, he gathered
his family around him to say his final farewell. His wife, mother,
three children and other relatives were gathered at his bedside. At
his wife’s first attempt to lift him up, he went limp and turned a
livid purple. His eyes closed and he was thought to be dead. His
wife placed herself in front of him to prevent the children from
seeing him. After a few minutes he re-opened his eyes, however.
His appearance became luminous, so to speak, and filled with an
expression of radiant beatitude, he exclaimed, “Oh, my children, it’s
beautiful... it’s sublime! Oh, death! What a blessing! What a sweet
thing! I was dead and I felt my soul rise up high, very high, but
God allowed me to return in order to tell you: Do not fear death; it
is deliverance ... I cannot possibly describe the magnificence of all
I saw, the impressions I experienced! You would not comprehend
them ... Oh! My children, always conduct yourselves in such a way
that you will merit the ineffable happiness reserved for righteous
men. Live according to the precepts of charity. If you have anything,
always give a part of it to those who lack the necessities of life ...

                          Part 2 - Chapter III


My dear wife, I am leaving you in a less than desirable position.
There are debts owed to us, but I beg you not to hound our debtors.
If they are in financial straights, wait until they can pay you, and
those who cannot repay you at all, forgive them; God will reward
you. You, my son, work to support your mother. Always be honest
and avoid doing anything that might dishonor our family. Take this
cross. I inherited it from my mother. Never lay it aside and may it
always remind you of my last words of advice ... My children, help
each other and mutually support one another; may harmony reign
amongst you. Don’t be vain or proud; forgive your enemies if you
want God to forgive you...” Then, signaling them to come closer, he
took their hands and added, “Bless you, my children,” and his eyes
closed for good. His face, however, retained such a stately expression
that up until the moment of his funeral, crowds of people viewed it
with wonder.
       A friend of the family supplied us with these interesting
details, and we thought that an evocation might be instructive for
all of us and useful to the spirit himself.
       1. Evocation
       “I’m right by you.”
       2. We have been told about your last moments and we were
left amazed. Would you be so kind as to describe to us in more
detail what you saw in the time period between what we might
call your two deaths?
       “What I saw ... would you be able to comprehend it? I
don’t know, since I can’t find the appropriate expressions to make
comprehensible what I saw during the brief moments when it was
possible for me to leave my mortal envelope.”
       3. Do you know where you were? Was it far from earth on some
other planet or in space?
       “A spirit doesn’t measure distances as you do. Carried away
by some unknown magnificent power, I saw the splendors of a sky


                                  268

                              Average Spirits


that is only possible in dreams. That race through the infinite was
so fast that I can’t determine the time it took for my spirit.”
       4. And are you now enjoying the happiness you foresaw at that time?
       “No. I would certainly love to enjoy it, but God can’t reward
me that much. I too often revolted against the blessed thoughts
my heart dictated to me, and death seemed like an injustice. A
disbelieving physician, I acquired in the art of healing an aversion
toward the second nature, which is our intelligent, divine impulse; for
me, the immortality of the soul was nothing more than a fiction fit to
seduce the uneducated. And yet, nothingness frightened me, because
many times I found myself cursing the mysterious agent that strikes
over and over again. Philosophy deceived me without enabling me to
understand all the grandeur of the Eternal One, who knows how to
mete out both sorrow and joy in order to teach humankind.”
       5. Did you realize the state you were in right after the final
disengagement of your spirit?
       “No. I only came to myself during the transition that my
spirit experienced while traveling through the ethereal regions. But
after my real death, that did not happen immediately; it took me
a few days to awaken.
       “God granted me a favor, and I will tell you why: my original
disbelief no longer existed; before I died I started to believe, for
after having scientifically and truly fathomed the disease that was
tormenting me, I could find no other earthly explanation except
divine reason, which inspired and consoled me and gave me
courage that was stronger than my pain. Thus, I blessed what I
had cursed and regarded the end as liberation. The idea of God
is as vast as the universe! Oh, what supreme consolation there is
in prayer; it arouses ineffable sentiments. It is the most positive
element of our non-material nature. Through prayer I understood,
I believed firmly and supremely, and that is why God, in weighing
my good deeds, rewarded me before the end of my incarnation.”


                                   269

                            Part 2 - Chapter III


       6. Could one say that you were actually dead during that first
instance?
       “Yes and no. Since my spirit had abandoned its body, the
flesh naturally started to decay; however, in repossessing my
earthly dwelling, life returned to the body, which had undergone
a transition, a sleep.”
       7. At that moment, did you feel the ties that reconnected you to
your body?
       “Of course. The spirit has a bond that is hard to break
and it cannot enter its natural life until the last shudder of
the flesh.”
       8. How could it be that at your apparent death and for a
few minutes thereafter, your spirit could have disengaged itself
instantaneously and without bewilderment, whereas your real death
was followed by several days of confusion? It seems that in the first case,
with the ties between soul and body lasting longer than in the second,
the disengagement should have been slower, which is just the opposite
of what actually happened.
       “You have often evoked incarnate spirits and have received
precise responses on the matter. I was in a state similar to theirs.
God called me and his servants said, ‘Come...’ I obeyed and
thanked him for the special favor that was granted to me so
that I could glimpse and comprehend his infinite grandeur. I
am grateful to those who, before my real death, allowed me
to instruct my loved ones so that they might lead good and
righteous incarnations.”
       9. Where did you get the beautiful words that you spoke to your
family after your awakening?
       “They were a reflection of what I had seen and understood.
Good spirits inspired my language and enlivened my expressions.”
       10. What impression do you think your revelation had on those
watching over you, especially your children?


                                    270

                              Average Spirits


        “Surprising, profound; death does not lie. No matter how
ungrateful they might be, children always bend an ear to an incarnation
that is ending. If we could enter our children’s hearts as they are gathered
around the open grave, we would see the beating of true and sincere
feelings as they are touched by the unseen hands of spirits who speak
to their innermost thoughts: Tremble if you doubt; death is reparation,
the justice of God. Let me assure you that in spite of their disbelief, my
family and friends believed the words I spoke before I died. Moreover, I
was the interpreter of another world.”
        11. You stated that you are not presently enjoying the happiness
you foresaw. May we conclude that you are unhappy?
        “No, since I became a believer in both heart and conscience
before I died. Pain afflicts us while on earth, but strengthens us
from the point of view of our future as spirits. Notice that God
took into account my prayers and the absolute faith I had in
him. I am firmly on the path of perfection and will some day
reach the end that I was allowed to glimpse. Pray, my friends, for
this invisible world that presides over your destinies; this sort of
fraternal exchange comes from charity; it is a lever that puts spirits
of all worlds in communication with one another.”
        12. Do you perchance wish to say a few words to your wife and
children?
        “I would ask them all to believe in the powerful, just and
immutable God; in prayer, which consoles and relieves; in charity,
which is the purest practice of human incarnation; and that they
remember that we can always give a little, at least. The alms which
the poor give are more meritorious before God, who knows that
they give much when they give a little. The rich must give a lot and
repeatedly in order to merit as much.
        “The future lies in the charity and benevolence of each
action, and in the belief that all spirits are family and that we
should never let childish vanities prevail.


                                    271

                         Part 2 - Chapter III


       “You will experience harsh trials, my dear beloved family.
But accept them courageously, remembering that God is watching
you. Repeat this prayer often: ‘God of love and goodness, who
grants all things, give us greater strength to bear all our ups and
downs, and enable us to be good, humble and charitable, small of
fortune but great of heart. Grant that we may be Spiritists while on
earth so that we might comprehend and love you more. May your
name, O my God, emblem of freedom, be the consoling aim of all
who are oppressed, of all who need to love, forgive, and believe.’”

       “Listen, I was far from being happy. Plunged into the
vastness, the infinite, my suffering was so intense that I could
hardly comprehend it. Blessed be God, who allowed me to come
to a sanctuary which the wicked cannot approach without impunity.
My friends, how grateful I am to you; how much strength I have
recovered here in your midst! Oh! Men of the good, continue to
meet and study often with one another, for you cannot doubt the
fruits of your serious meetings. Discarnate spirits who still have
much to learn, those who intentionally remain idle, indolent and
oblivious to their duties, may be found there among you, due to
fortuitous circumstances or otherwise. Surprised by a terrible jolt,
such spirits are often given the chance to withdraw into themselves,
to take a good look at themselves, to get a glimpse of their hoped-for
goal. They feel strengthened by the example you provide and thus
seek the means to escape the painful condition they’re in. It is with
much satisfaction that I speak on behalf of such suffering souls, for
I am speaking to men of heart and I know I won’t be turned away.

my own gratitude and that of all my friends for whom – perhaps
without knowing it – you have done so much good.”

for a long time after having strayed from the upright way. He has
come to understand his errors, has repented and has turned his eyes
toward the God whom he used to deny. His position is not that of
a happy spirit, although he aspires to happiness and does not suffer
anymore. God allowed him to come and hear you and afterward
to descend to a lower sphere in order to instruct and stimulate the
progress of other spirits, who, like himself, transgressed the Eternal
One’s law. Such is the reparation he has been charged with. In the
end, he will gain happiness, for he has the will to do so.”

                   Mrs. Anna Belleville
       A young woman of thirty-five, Mrs. Belleville died after a long
and cruel illness. Lively, spiritual and endowed with rare intelligence,
she possessed rectitude of judgment and eminent moral qualities.
She was a wife and devoted mother, and, moreover, possessed an
uncommon integrity of character and an expedient spirit that enabled
her to never be caught off guard by the most critical circumstances
of life. Without harboring resentment towards individuals against
whom she might have much to complain, she was always ready to
help them when the occasion arose. Having known her intimately
for several years, we were able to follow all the phases of her life as
well as all the events of her demise.
       An accident gave rise to the terrible illness that finally took
her away after having held her bedfast for three years and prey to
the cruelest suffering, which she bore until the end with heroic
courage and with the natural grace of her spirit. She firmly believed
in the existence of the soul and the future life, but concerned
herself little with the matter. All her thoughts were related to the
present, which was very important to her, although she had no
fear of death and did not seek material pleasures. Her life was
simple, and she could easily do without what she was unable to
obtain. Nonetheless, she possessed an innate sentiment of the
good and beautiful, which she appreciated in the smallest things.
She wanted to live less for herself and more for her children. She
knew they needed her and that is what kept her clinging to life.
She understood Spiritism without having studied it deeply; she
was interested in it but could never manage to think in terms of
the future. The future was indeed a reality to her but it did not
make a profound impression on her spirit. The good she practiced
resulted from a natural, spontaneous impulse without any thought
of future recompense or punishment.

       There was much despair over her condition, and we
expected to see her leave at any moment, a circumstance of which
she herself was fully aware. One day while her husband was away,
she felt herself failing and understood that her time had come. Her
sight clouded over, confusion took hold and she felt all the anguish
of separation. However, she held off death until her husband
returned. Making a supreme effort, she told herself, “No, I do not
want to die!” Then she felt her life return and she recovered the
full use of her faculties. When her husband arrived, she told him,
“I was about to die, but I wanted to wait until you were next to me
because I have a few suggestions for you.” Her struggle between
life and death was prolonged for three more months thereafter, a
time that was nothing but long and painful agony.
       Evocation on the day after her death.
       “My good friends, thank you for your interest; moreover,
you have been like good relatives to me. Well then, rejoice, for I
am happy now. Comfort my poor husband and watch over my
children. I went to them right after my passing.”
       It seems that your confusion didn’t last very long, since you are
responding to us quite lucidly.
       “Ah! My friends, I suffered so much ... you well know that
I suffered with resignation! Well, my trial is over. You say that I
am completely free, but it isn’t so. It is true, however, that I’m no
longer suffering and that is a big relief! At this time I’m completely
healed, I assure you, but I still need the help of your prayers to
come back later to work with you.”
       What could have been the cause of your suffering for so long?
       “A terrible past, my friend.”
       Could you tell us about it?
       “Oh! Let me forget about it for a while ... I have paid so
dearly for it...”
       One month after her death:

       Now that you must be completely separated and are more in
touch with yourself, we would greatly appreciate a more conclusive
hearing with you. Could you tell us what caused your prolonged agony?
For three months you hung in the balance between life and death.
       “Thank you, my friends, for remembering me in your
prayers! How soothing they have been and how much they have
worked for my liberation! I still feel the need to be comforted;
continue to pray for me. You understand the value of prayer. Your
prayers are not like some banal formula, like those murmured by
so many others who do not understand the reach and benefit of a
good prayer.
       “I am suffering a lot, but my suffering has been largely
compensated for because I am allowed quite often to be close to
my dear children, whom I left behind with so much regret!
       “I myself prolonged my suffering at that time. The ardent
desire to live out of love for my children made me cling to matter
and, unlike others, I stood firm and did not want to abandon my
unfortunate body, which I so much needed to break with, and which
was for me the instrument of such torture. That was the true cause
of my long agony. As for the illness and the suffering I endured, they
were an expiation for my past – one more debt paid off.
       “Ah! My good friends, if I had but listened to you, how
different my life would be right now! What relief I would have
felt during my final moments and how much easier the separation
would have been if instead I had confidently abandoned myself
to the will of God, to the current that was carrying me away! But
rather than looking toward the future that awaited me, I only saw
the present that I would be leaving behind!
       “When I return to earth, I shall be a Spiritist – I assure you.
What an immense science! I attend your meetings quite often and
listen to the counsels transmitted to you. If I could have understood
them while on earth, my suffering would have been lessened. But

the time had not yet come. Today, I understand the goodness and
justice of God, although I am not yet sufficiently evolved to detach
myself from the things of life. My children attract me mostly, not
so much to spoil them, but to watch over them and to make sure
they follow the path that Spiritism is presently tracing out on
the earth. Yes, my good friends, I still have serious concerns: one
especially, because my children’s future depends on it.”
       Could you provide us any information about the past you regret
so much?
       “Ah! My good friends, I am ready to confess. I scorned
someone else’s suffering. I watched my mother suffer without
showing her any compassion and I regarded her illness as imaginary.
Since she wasn’t laid up in bed, I believed she wasn’t actually
suffering and I mocked her misery. That is how God punishes.”
       Six months after her death:
       Now that more time has passed since you left your material
envelope, could you describe your situation and your occupation in the
spirit world?
       “During my earthly life, I was what is commonly called a
good person, but I prized my own welfare above anything else.
Although I was compassionate by nature, I was not capable of
making too much of a sacrifice to ease another’s misfortune.
Now, all that has changed and although I am still the same me,
the ‘me’ of yesterday has changed. I have grown and I see that,
in the invisible world, there are neither categories nor conditions
other than personal merit. Here, the one who used to be good and
charitable, though poor, is now above the one who used to be rich
and who used to humiliate the poor with his alms. I especially
watch over those who are afflicted with family troubles, the loss
of relatives or the loss of fortune. My mission is to console and
encourage them, and in doing so I am very happy.”
                                                                Anna

                             Part 2 - Chapter III


        An important question arises from the above-stated facts:
        Can a person, through an effort of his or her own will, delay
the moment of the soul’s separation from the body?
        St. Louis’ response: “To answer this question in the affirmative
without any restrictions would lead to erroneous conclusions. Under
certain conditions, an incarnate spirit may prolong its corporeal
existence in order to finish giving what it regards as indispensable
instructions. Such a right might be granted, as in this particular
case as well as in many others. This extension of life, however,
can only be for a brief time, since it is prohibited for any human
being to subvert the order of natural law and cause a return to the
earthly life by an act of willpower once the end has been reached. It
is nothing but a temporary reprieve. Meanwhile, the fact that it is
possible should not lead one to conclude its generality, nor should
one believe that it depends solely on the person to prolong his or her
life in this way. As a trial for the spirit or in the interest of concluding
a mission, failing organs may receive an infusion of the vital fluid,
which will enable them to add a few moments to the physical
manifestation of thought. Such cases are the exception and not the
rule. Also, one must not see in this incident God’s derogation from
the immutability of the divine laws, but a consequence of the free
will of the human soul, who, at the final moment, is aware of its
mission and, despite death, wishes to accomplish what it has until
now failed to do. Sometimes, this prolongation of vitality may be a
form of punishment inflicted on a spirit who doubts the future and
it will necessarily suffer because of it.
                                                                    St. Louis

       We might marvel at the relative quickness with which this
spirit disengaged herself, given her attachment to corporeal life.
However, we should realize that such attachment had nothing
material or sensual about it, but rather had its moral aspect,


                                     278

                            Average Spirits


motivated as it was by the needs of her young children. Moreover,
she was a spirit who was advanced in intelligence and morality:
one degree higher and she could have been among the happy
spirits. Her perispiritual links, therefore, lacked the attachment
that would have resulted from a greater identification with matter.
In fact, one could say that her life, debilitated by her long illness,
was only held together by tenuous threads that she wanted to
keep from breaking. Nonetheless, her resistance was punished by
an increase in her suffering from the illness itself and not from
the difficulty of disengagement. Thus, when her spirit finally did
separate, her state of confusion was brief.
       Another equally important fact that may be derived from this
evocation, as well as in the case of most others made over periods
of time more or less close to death, is the gradual change that takes
place in the thoughts of the spirit and from which progress may
follow. With this spirit, such progress occurs not because of better
sentiments, but because of a more correct appraisal of the situation.
A soul’s progress in the spirit life is therefore a fact demonstrated
by experience. Corporeal life is the practical application of such
progress, the test of the spirit’s resolutions, the crucible in which
it purifies itself.
       Since the soul continues to progress after death, its fate
cannot be irrevocably set, because the definitive setting of a spirit’s
fate is, as we have stated, a denial of progress. Since progress and
a set fate cannot coexist at the same time, we must choose the one
that is sanctioned both by the facts and by reason.

return to the world of spirits, dictated to the Parisian Spiritist
Society in October of 1860)
       “After death, hardened, selfish and evil spirits are soon
confronted with cruel doubt with respect to their present and
future fate. They look around and cannot see anything on which
to exert their evil influence – something that drives them to despair
since isolation and inaction are intolerable to evil spirits. They
cannot look up toward the places inhabited by pure spirits, and so
they take into account only what is around them. Perceiving the
abasement of the weak and chastised spirits about them, they attach
themselves to them and make them their prey. They torment them
with the memory of their past wrongs, which they continuously
re-enact through derisive pantomimes. Since this mockery is not
enough for them, however, they flock to the earth like starving
vultures, seeking among humans a soul who opens up easily to
their temptations. When they find it, they seize it, stimulating its
covetousness and seeking to extinguish its faith in God, until they
finally take hold of its conscience. When their prey is secure, they
spread their influence upon whomever approaches – it comprises
a fatal contagion.

        “An evil spirit feels almost happy as it expresses its hatred
and only suffers at times in which it cannot act or in cases where
the good triumphs over its evil.
        “Nevertheless, centuries pass; the evil spirit notices that
darkness has finally swallowed it up; its circle of action has become
restricted and its conscience – mute until now – makes it feel the
bitter thorns of remorse. Inactive and in the grip of a whirlwind,
it wanders aimlessly and, as the Scriptures say, it feels its hair
stand on end out of terror. Soon, a great emptiness fills it: the
time has come in which it must expiate its wrongs; reincarnation
is at the doorstep, menacing; it sees as in a mirage the terrible
trials that await it. The spirit would like to retreat, but proceeds
forward, dropping down into the gaping abyss of life, wallowing
in fear as the veil of forgetfulness falls over its eyes. It lives and
acts, guilty still, sensing an unknown disquieting memory of its
past. Certain presentiments make it tremble, but they are not
enough to make it turn from the path of evil. Finally, depleted of
strength and weakened by its life of crime, it approaches death
once more. Lying on a pallet or on a bed (it does not matter!),
this guilty person, under his apparent immobility, feels a world
of forgotten sensations stirring. Beneath his closed eyelids, he
sees a light rising; he hears strange sounds; his soul, ready to leave
the body, stirs impatiently while his twitching hands try to cling
to the covers. He would like to speak, to shout at those around
him ‘Keep me here! I can see the punishment ahead!’ But he
can do nothing – death has sealed his parched lips, while those
watching say, ‘Rest in peace!’
        “Nonetheless, the spirit can hear everything as it floats
around the body it does not wish to abandon. A mysterious power
tugs at it. It sees and recognizes what it sees. Terror-stricken, it
darts forth into space wherein it would like to hide, but there is
neither refuge nor rest! Other spirits return to it the evil it has

committed; punished, mocked, heckled and confused in its turn,
it wanders about and will continue to wander until the divine
light permeates its callousness and enlightens it, showing it the
avenging God who triumphs over all evil, and whom it will only
appease through groaning and expiation.”

      Never has a more eloquent, more horrifying but true picture
been painted about the fate of evil spirits. Is there really any need
to add the phantasmagoria of flames and physical torture?

                             Novel
       (This spirit addressed itself to the medium,
           whom he had known while alive.)

       “I’m going to tell you about my suffering when I died.
My spirit, held to the body by material bonds, had great
difficulty in breaking free. That was in and of itself the first
phase of cruel anguish. The life I left behind at just 21 years
of age was yet so strong in me that I couldn’t believe I had lost
it. Thus, I searched for my body but was both amazed and
terrified at finding that I was lost in a whirlpool of darkness.
Finally, the awareness of my situation and the revelation
of the wrongs I had committed during all my incarnations
suddenly struck me; an implacable light illuminated the most
secret corners of my soul. I felt naked and was soon taken
with overpowering shame. I tried to run from that feeling by
being interested in the new – and thus unknown – objects
surrounding me. Luminous spirits hovered in the ether and
displayed a blessedness to which I couldn’t aspire, while dark
and desolate forms – some immersed in gloomy despair, others


                                 283

                         Part 2 - Chapter IV


furious or mocking – glided around me or upon the earth, to
which I stayed attached. I saw people moving about and I
envied how unaware they were. A whole order of unknown,
or rather, restored sensations invaded me at the same time.
Pulled by an irresistible force and trying to run from the cruel
pain, I crossed distances, the elements and physical obstacles,
and neither natural beauties nor heavenly splendors could
calm for one instant the lacerations of my conscience or the
terror caused by the revelation of eternity. Mortals can sense
impending physical torture by the shivering of the flesh, but
their fragile pains, softened by hope, mitigated by distractions
or deadened by forgetfulness, will never give them an idea
of the anguish of a soul that suffers without respite, without
hope, without repentance. After some time (I cannot tell how
long), envying the elect whose splendors I beheld, loathing
the evil spirits who pursued me with mocking remarks, and
despising people whose turpitude I witnessed, I went from a
state of profound dejection to one of insensate rebellion.
       “Finally, you called me, and for the first time a soft and
tender sentiment allayed me. I listened to the teachings that your
spirit guides give you, the truth entered my heart and I prayed.
God has heard me and has revealed himself to me through his
clemency, just as he use to reveal himself by his justice.”

companions in revelry because of his qualities as a man of the
world. He did no evil, but he did no good either. He died as the
result of a fall from a carriage during a ride. He was evoked a few
days after his death by a medium who had known him indirectly,
and he gave the following series of communications:
       March 8, 1863 – “I have only just managed to separate from
my body and it is difficult for me to talk to you. The terrible fall
that caused the death of my body put my spirit in a great state of
confusion. I am anxious as to what will become of me, and such
uncertainty is cruel. The dreadful suffering my body experienced
is nothing compared to this confusion I find myself in. Pray that
God will forgive me. Oh, what pain! Oh, have mercy, my God!
What pain! Goodbye.”
       March 18 – “I already came to you once, but could only
speak with difficulty. I am still in great pain right now as I am
communicating with you. You are the only medium whom I can ask
for prayers that God’s goodness may draw me out of this confusion.
How can I still be suffering when my body doesn’t exist anymore?
Why does this horrific pain, this terrible anguish continue? Pray, oh!
Pray that God may grant me repose ... oh! Such cruel uncertainty!
I’m still connected to my body. It is with difficulty that I see where
I’m supposed to be; my body is there, but why do I remain there?
Come and pray over my body so that I can be rid of that cruel prison.
God will forgive me, I hope. I can see the spirits around you and it
is with their help that I can talk to you. Pray for me.”
       April 6 – “It’s me again; I’ve come to ask you to pray for
me. You absolutely have to go to where my body is lying so that
you may beg the Omnipotent to ease my suffering. I’m suffering!
Oh, how I’m suffering! Go there – you’ve got to! – and say a
prayer to the Lord that he might forgive me. I see that I could
be more at peace, but I keep returning to the place where they
buried what used to be me.”

                          Part 2 - Chapter IV


       The medium had at first neglected the spirit’s request to go
and pray over his grave; however, he went there later and received
this communication:
       May 11 - “I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been waiting
for you to come to where my spirit seems to be stuck to
its shell, so that you might beg the merciful God that his
goodness may ease my suffering. You can help me with your
prayers. Don’t stop, I beg you. I see how contrary my life was
to what it should have been. I see the wrongs I committed.
I was a useless being while in the world. I didn’t make any
good use of my faculties. My wealth only served to satisfy my
passions, my taste for luxury and my vanity. I only thought
about the pleasures of the body and not those of the soul. Will
God’s mercy ever descend upon me, a poor spirit who is still
suffering for his earthly wrongs? Pray for him to forgive me
and free me from the pain that still afflicts me. Thank you for
having come here to pray for me.”
       June 8 – “I can speak and I’m thankful to God for allowing
it. I have seen my wrongs and hope that God will forgive me.
Shape your life always according to the belief that animates you,
for it has reserved a future repose for you that I still don’t have.
Thank you for your prayers. Until another time...”
       This spirit’s insistence that the medium pray over his grave
is a remarkable particularity, but is reasonable if we consider the
tenacity of the ties that held him to his body and how long and
difficult it was for him to disengage himself due to his materialistic
existence. We understand that when offered close to the body,
prayer might exert a sort of powerful magnetic action in assisting
with the separation. Mightn’t the widespread custom of praying
over dead bodies have come from an unconscious intuition to this
effect? In such a case, the efficacy of prayer would achieve both a
moral and physical result.

I haven’t concluded my expiation. I need to make up for lost time
if I don’t want to prolong my suffering. I hope that God will take
into account the sincerity of my repentance and will grant me
forgiveness. Keep praying for me still – I beg you. My brothers,
I only lived for myself and now I’m expiating it and suffering!
May God grant you the grace to avoid the thorns that tear at me.
Follow the broad path of the Lord and pray for me, for I abused
the blessings that God loans his creatures!

and should accustom themselves to living without losing sight
of the eternity awaiting them; they must detach themselves from
material pleasures. Their food should have no other purpose but
to give them strength; luxury should be kept to the requirement
of their social position; their tastes and even their most natural
propensities should be subject to sane reasoning; otherwise, they
become more materialized instead of more purified. Human
passions are narrow ties that embed themselves in the flesh, so do
not allow them to imprison you. Live, but do not become bons
vivants. You don’t know the price you will pay when you return
to your true homeland! Earthly passions rob you of everything
before they cease, and you arrive naked, completely naked before
the Lord. Ah! Cover yourselves with good deeds; they will help
you narrow the gap that separates you from eternity. Like a bright
robe, they will hide your human turpitudes. Wrap yourselves in
charity and love – divine garments that no one can take away.”

       Comments by the medium’s Guide: “This spirit is on the right
path, because in addition to repentance he adds advice to be wary
of the dangers of the path that he himself had taken. Recognizing
his errors is already meritorious and an effective step toward the
good. That is why his situation, albeit not happy, is no longer of a
suffering spirit. Having repented, the reparation of another lifetime
of trials is open to him. Well now, do you know the situation of
persons who live sensual lives and who did not give their spirit any
other activity than the incessant invention of new pleasures? The
influence of matter follows them beyond the grave. Death does not
put an end to their material appetites, which their sight, as limited
as it was while on the earth, seeks in vain the means to satisfy.
Having never sought spiritual nourishment, their soul wanders in
the void, without aim, without hope and prey to the anguish of
those who have nothing before them except a desert without end.
Since they did not pursue spiritual endeavors while on the earth,
they naturally cannot pursue any such work as spirits after death.
No longer able to satisfy their body, they have nothing to satisfy
their spirit either. Thus, they experience mortal boredom and
they cannot foresee the end of it. They would prefer nothingness
instead, but there is no such thing as nothingness – one can kill the
body but not the spirit. They must therefore continue to live this
mental anguish until finally, overcome with the weariness of it all,
they decide to turn their eyes toward God.”

                            Lisbeth
              (Bordeaux, February 13, 1862)

      A suffering spirit, writing under the name of Lisbeth.
      1. Would you mind providing me with a few details regarding
your current position, as well as the cause of your suffering?


                                288

                             Suffering Spirits


        “Be humble of heart, submissive to God’s will, patient in
trial, charitable toward the poor, consoling toward the weak, and
sensitive to all suffering and you will not have to experience the
torment I’m going through.”
        2. You seem to regret the wrongs you committed and which were
contrary to the qualities you have stated. Has your repentance brought
you any relief?
        “No. Repentance is useless when it is but the result of
suffering. Effective repentance must be based on the regret of
having offended God and on an ardent desire to make reparation.
I still haven’t been able to do that, unfortunately. Recommend
me to the prayers of all those who are sympathetic toward the
sufferings of others, for I have need of them.”
        This statement is a great truth. Sometimes, suffering brings
about a less than sincere cry of repentance which is not the
expression of sorrow for having committed evil, because if the spirit
ceased to suffer, it would commit the evil all over again. That is why
repentance does not always result in the immediate liberation of
the spirit; it predisposes it to liberation – that is all. It will have to
prove its sincerity and firmness of resolution by going through new
trials, which will be the reparation for the evil it had committed.
In carefully pondering all the examples that have been cited so far,
we will discover in the words of these spirits – even the most low
order ones – profound teachings that put us in touch with the most
intimate details of spirit life. While superficial individuals will see in
these examples nothing more than picturesque stories, serious and
reflective persons will find an abundant wellspring of study in them.
        3. I will do as you have requested. Could you provide me
with a few details of your last existence? We might derive some useful
instruction and thus make your repentance productive.
        (The spirit wavered not only in answering this question but also
regarding those that followed.)

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


        “I was born into a high social status. I had everything men
regard as the source of happiness. Being wealthy, I was selfish;
being beautiful, I was vain, insensitive, and deceitful; being noble
of birth, I was ambitious. With my power I crushed those who
didn’t fling themselves at my feet; I even oppressed those who were
at my feet, without thinking that the Lord’s anger sooner or later
crushes the highest brows.”
        4. When did you live?
        “One hundred fifty years ago in Prussia.”
        5. Haven’t you made any progress as a spirit since then?
        “No. The influence of matter causes me to rebel and you
cannot imagine the hold it still has on me despite the separation
of my spirit from its body. Pride binds us in bronze chains, whose
links tighten more and more around those who abandon their
hearts to it. Pride – that hydra with 100 heads that are constantly
replaced – knows how to sing with poisonous hisses that seem like
celestial harmony! Pride – that multiform demon that molds itself
to all the aberrations of your spirit – hides in all the recesses of your
heart. It enters your veins, it envelops you, it absorbs and draws
you into the darkness of eternal Gehenna! Oh, yes... eternal!”
        This spirit undoubtedly says she has not made any progress
because her situation continues to be painful. However, the
way in which she describes pride and deplores its consequences
is undeniably progress. While she was incarnate and even soon
after her death, she obviously would not have been able to reason
like this. She understands evil, and that is already something. The
courage and resolve to avoid it will come later.
        6. God is too good to condemn his children to eternal punishment.
You can trust in his mercy.
        “There will be an end to my suffering, they say, but when? I
have sought an end to it for a long time but have seen nothing but
suffering... always, always, always!

       7. Why have you come here today?
       “I was brought here by a spirit who has accompanied me
many times.”
       - When did you start seeing this spirit?
       “Not long ago.”
       - Was it when you started to become aware of the wrongs you
had committed?
       (After long reflection) “Yes, you’re right. It was then that I
began to see the spirit.”
       8. Do you now understand the relationship that exists between
your repentance and the visible help given you by your protector spirit?
You should see as the origin of such support the love of God, whose
purpose is forgiveness and infinite mercy.
       “Oh! How I want that to be true!”
       - I believe I can promise it in the most sacred name of the One
who has never turned a deaf ear on his afflicted children. Pray from
the bottom of your heart and God will listen.
       “I can’t; I’m afraid.”
       9. Then let’s pray together. God will listen to us. (After prayer)
Are you still here?
       “Yes, thank you! Please don’t forget me.”
       10. Come here every day.
       “Yes, yes, I’ll come every day.”
       The medium’s Guide: Never forget the teachings you derive
from the sufferings of your wards, especially as to what causes
them; they are a lesson from which all may profit. They can
save you from the same dangers and similar punishment. Purify
your hearts; be humble; love and help one another and may your
grateful heart never forget the fount of all grace, that inexhaustible
fount from which any one of you can drink, that fount of living
water that quenches and nourishes at the same time, that fount
of eternal life and blessedness. Go to it, my dear ones, and drink

with faith. Cast your nets into it and they will emerge from its
waves laden with blessings. Warn your brothers and sisters of the
dangers they may encounter. Spread the Lord’s blessings, which
multiply without end; the more you spread them around you,
the more they will thrive. It is in your hands, because when you
tell your brothers and sisters, “There lie the dangers; there lie the
obstacles; follow us in order to avoid them; follow our example,”
you will spread the Lord’s blessings upon all who hear you. May
your efforts be blessed, my dear ones. The Lord loves pure hearts;
be worthy of his love.

                       (Bordeaux, 1862)

       A suffering spirit presents himself under the name of Ouran,
formerly a Russian prince.
       Would you like to provide us with some details about your
situation?
       “Oh! Happy are the humble in heart, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven! Pray for me. Happy are those who, humble
in heart, choose a modest position to fulfill their trial! All you
whom envy devours, you don’t know the state that those who on
earth are regarded as happy become reduced to. You don’t know
the burning coals that consume them, or the sacrifices imposed by
wealth when you seek your salvation in it! May the Lord allow me,
a proud despot, to expiate the crimes caused by my pride among
those whom I oppressed with my tyranny. Pride! Repeat that word
constantly so that you will never forget that it is the source of all
the suffering that afflicts us. Yes, I abused the power and favor
I enjoyed. I was harsh and cruel toward those below me, those
who had to bow down before all my caprices and satisfy all my

                            Suffering Spirits


depravities. I wanted nobility, fortune and honors for myself. I
succumbed to the burden because it was above my strength.”
       Spirits who succumb usually claim they had made a
commitment that was beyond their strength, which is a further
remnant of pride and a way for them to make excuses rather than
acknowledge that they failed due to their own weakness. God does
not give anyone more than they can bear; God does not require
anyone to give more than they can; God does not require a sapling
to bear the fruit of a mature tree. Furthermore, God gives freedom
to spirits. What they lack is willpower and this depends exclusively
on themselves. With willpower there are no insuperable vices;
however, whenever we take pleasure in a vice, it is natural for us not
to put forth the effort to overcome it. Thus, we can only attribute the
consequences to ourselves.
       You are aware of your wrongs and that is already a step toward
regeneration.
       “Such awareness is a further suffering. For many spirits,
suffering is an almost physical effect, since still under the influence
of the humanity of their last incarnation they have no perception
of any mental sense. My spirit has released itself from matter,
and now my mental sense has assumed all those horrible, cruel
sensations that used to be physical.”
       - Do you foresee any end to your suffering?
       “I know that it will not last forever but I can’t see any end to
it at present. I must undergo another trial first.”
       Do you hope to do so soon?
       “Again, I don’t know.”
       - Can you remember anything about your previous lives? I’m
asking this for the purpose of instruction.
       “Yes, your guides are present and they know what you need.
I lived during the time of Marcus Aurelius. There, once again
powerful, I succumbed to pride, the cause of all downfalls. After

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


being in the errant state for centuries, I wanted to live an obscure
existence. So, as a poor student, I had to beg for bread; pride,
however, still had a hold on me. My spirit gained in knowledge
but not in virtue. Learned and ambitious, I sold my soul to the
best offer, serving all manner of vengeance and hatred. I felt
guilty but the thirst for glory and wealth strangled the voice of
my conscience. My expiation was long and cruel. Then finally,
in my last incarnation I wanted to live a life of luxury and power
once again. I thought I could overcome the stumbling blocks but
wouldn’t listen to any advice. It was pride once more leading me to
trust in myself instead of the counsel of the protector friends who
always watch over us. You know the result of that last attempt.
       “Now, I finally understand and await the mercy of the Lord.
I place my crushed pride at his feet and ask him to lay on me
the heaviest tax of humility, for with the help of his grace, the
weight will seem light. Pray with me and for me. Also pray that
that diabolical fire will not devour the instincts that will lead you
to God. Friends in suffering, may my example be of use to you.
Never forget that pride is the enemy of happiness, for it is pride
that causes all the ills that afflict humankind and it pursues them
up to the heavenly regions.”
       The medium’s Guide: “You have had some doubts about the
identity of this spirit because his language seems to be at odds with
the state of suffering characteristic of a less elevated spirit. Lay such
doubts aside, for you have received an authentic communication.
In spite of his suffering, this spirit has enough cultured intelligence
to express himself in such a manner. The only thing he lacked was
humility, without which no spirit can reach God. He has finally
achieved such humility and we hope that with perseverance he will
emerge triumphant from a new trial.
       “Our heavenly Father is most just in his wisdom and takes
into account individuals’ efforts to overcome their evil instincts.

                           Suffering Spirits


Each victory over yourselves is a rung on that ladder that leans on
the earth on one end, with the other at the feet of the supreme Judge.
Climb each rung resolutely; the ascent is gentle for those whose
will is firm. Always look heavenward for your encouragement;
unfortunate are you if you stop and look down! Dizziness soon
strikes you and you are terrified at the emptiness surrounding you.
Discouraged, you say: what’s the use of going any further if I have
advanced so little? No, my friends, do not look down. Pride is part
of human nature. Very well! Use this pride to give you the strength
and courage to achieve your ascension. Use it to overcome your
weaknesses and climb to the summit of the eternal mountain.”

                         Pascal Lavic
                   (Havre, August 9, 1863)

        The medium knew nothing about the life or name of this
spirit, who communicated spontaneously.
        “I believe in the goodness of God, who, in his mercy, will
show compassion to my spirit. I have suffered so much; my body
perished at sea; my spirit has remained attached to my body and
has been wandering for a long time upon the waves. God...”
        (The communication was interrupted, but on the following
day the spirit continued.)
        “God kindly allowed the prayers of those who I left behind
on earth to draw me out of the state of confusion and uncertainty
in which I found myself immersed. They searched for me for a
long time and they were able to finally find my body. It is now at
rest, and although my spirit released itself with so much difficulty,
it now sees the wrongs it committed. When a trial is spent, God
judges fairly and his goodness extends to all who repent.
        “If my spirit wandered around together with my body
for so long, it was because I had to make expiation. Follow the

upright path if you want God to free your spirit promptly from
its envelope. Live in his love; pray, and death, which is fearful to
so many, will be softened for you because you have knowledge of
the life that awaits you. I succumbed to the sea and they held out
hope for me for a long time. Not being able to disengage from my
body was a terrible trial and that is why I need your prayers. You
hold a belief that redeems and you can ask God on my behalf. I
have repented and hope that he will forgive me. It was on August 6
that they found my body. I was a poor sailor and died a long time
ago. Pray for me.”
                                                       Pascal Lavic

        Where did they find your body?
        “Not far from here.”
        On August 11, 1863, the Havre newspaper ran the following
article, of which the medium could have had no knowledge:
        News has been received that on the 6th of this month the remains
of a corpse were found between Bléville and La Hève. The head, arms
and torso had disappeared, but its identification was possible from the
shoes that were still on the feet. The body was recognized as that of the
fisherman Lavic, who perished on board the “L’Alerte” on December
11 near Trouville during a storm. Lavic was 49 years old and a native
of Calais. His widow made the identification.
        On August 12, as this occurrence was being discussed in the
circle where the spirit first manifested, he once again spontaneously
gave the following communication:
        “I really am Pascal Lavic and I need your prayers. You can
help me, because my trial has been dreadful. My spirit separated
from my body only after I realized my wrongs, and even then it
still did not completely disconnect, staying close by as the ocean
swallowed my body. So, pray that God may forgive me and grant
me rest. Pray for me – I beg you. Let this disastrous end to an

unhappy earthly life be a lesson for you! You must always ponder
the future and never stop asking God for his mercy. Pray for me; I
need God’s compassion.”

                             Ferdinand Bertin69
        A medium from Havre evoked the spirit of an acquaintance
and received this response: “I want to communicate, but I cannot
overcome the obstacle that exists between us and am forced to let
these other unhappy sufferers approach you.” Then the following
spontaneous communication was received:
        “I’m in a horrible abyss! Help me... Oh! My God! Who will
rescue me from this abyss? Who will offer a merciful hand to the
unfortunate spirit the sea has engulfed? Night is so dark that I’m
afraid ... Surrounded by the roaring of the waves and no friendly
word to console and help me in this dire moment. This dark night,
it is death in all its horrors, and I don’t want to die! Oh! My God! It
is not the death yet to come; it is the death that has happened! I am
forever separated from those dear to me ... I see my body and what
I felt a little while ago is nothing but the memory of the terrible
agony of separation ... Take pity on me, you who are aware of my
suffering. Pray for me, for I don’t want to keep feeling anymore,
as has been happening since that fatal night! But that is to be my
punishment; I sense it ... Pray for me; I beg of you! ... Oh! The
sea ... the cold ... I’m going to be swallowed up! ... Help! ... Have
mercy; don’t push me away! We can both save ourselves on this
plank! ... Oh! I’m choking! The waves are going to toss me about,
and my loved ones won’t have the consolation of ever seeing me

     The name at the top of the message is Ferdinand and at the bottom is François, in keeping
     with the French edition. This inconsistency has not been corrected in order to reflect
     Kardec’s original. – Tr.

again ... But no! I see that my body no longer will be tossed about
by the waves ... My mother’s prayers will be heard ... My poor
mother! If she could imagine that her son is as miserable as he
really is, she would certainly pray more. But she believes that death
has sanctified my past and she weeps for me as a martyr and not as
an unhappy and punished creature! ... Oh! You who understand it,
will you be without pity? No, you shall pray for me.”
                                                    François Bertin

       This name was completely unknown to the medium, who
did not have even a vague memory of it. He supposed that this
spirit was undoubtedly some unfortunate drowning victim who
spontaneously manifested, as had happened in several other cases.
He later found out that in fact the name was that of one of the
victims of a large maritime disaster that had occurred in those
waters on December 2, 1863. The communication was given on
the 8th of the same month, 6 days after the tragedy. The individual
died while making unheard-of attempts to save the crew and, at
the time, thought himself safe from death.
       Since he did not have any relationship with the medium, nor
was he even known by him, why did he manifest to him instead
of to some member of his family? It is because spirits cannot find
in all individuals the fluidic conditions that are indispensable for
manifestation. In his confusion, he had little freedom to choose
and was instinctively led and attracted to this medium, who was
obviously endowed with the essential aptitude for spontaneous
communications of this type. He also sensed a particular sympathy,
like others who have found themselves in identical circumstances.
His family, foreign to Spiritism, and even perhaps hostile toward
it, would not have welcomed this medium’s revelation.
       Although death had occurred a few days before, the
spirit was still experiencing all the anguish connected with it.


                                298

                           Suffering Spirits


Obviously, he was still not aware of his situation, believing
himself still alive, struggling with the waves, but at the same
time referring to his body as though he were separate from it.
He cries for help and says he does not want to die, but then
soon afterward he speaks of the cause of his death, recognizing
it as a punishment. All of this denotes the confusion of thought
that almost always follows violent deaths.
        Two months later on February 2, 1864, the spirit once more
communicated spontaneously through the same medium and
dictated the following:
        “The pity you have shown for my horrible suffering has
helped me. I understand hope and can foresee forgiveness, but
only after being punished for the wrong committed. I suffer
continuously, and if at times God now allows me to foresee the
end of my misfortune, I owe this mitigation to the prayers of the
charitable souls touched by my situation. O hope, heavenly light,
how blessed you are as I feel you rising in my soul! But oh! The
abyss opens wide. Terror and suffering makes such thoughts of
mercy disappear ... The night; always the night! ... The water, the
roar of the waves as they engulf my body are but a pale image of
the horror that envelops my poor spirit ... I feel calmer when I can
be near you, for as entrusting a secret to a friend relieves one who
has been oppressed, so your pity, motivated by my entrusting my
misery to you, calms my suffering and gives repose to my spirit...
        “Your prayers do me good; please don’t refuse them to me.
I don’t want to fall back into that dreadful dream that becomes
reality when I see it ... Take up the pen often. Communicating
with you does me so much good!”
        A few days later, this same spirit was evoked at a Spiritist
meeting in Paris and the following questions were asked of
it. He replied to them in a single communication through a
different medium:


                                 299

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


        Who induced you to manifest spontaneously through the first
medium with whom you communicated? How long had it been since
your death when you manifested yourself? At that time you seemed to
question whether you were dead or alive, but at the same time you
experienced all the anguish of an awful death. Do you now understand
your situation better? You affirmed that your death was an expiation.
Can you provide us with a reason for it? This will provide instruction
for us and will bring relief to you. By making a sincere confession, you
will merit God’s mercy, which we will ask for in our prayers.
        “First of all, it seems impossible that a human creature can
suffer so cruelly. God! How painful it is to find yourself constantly
engulfed in waves of fury, to incessantly feel this torture, this
glacial cold that presses on your stomach and grips it!
        “But what good is it for you to concern yourselves with such
a scene? Shouldn’t I start by obeying the laws of gratitude, thanking
all of you who have taken an interest in my torments? You asked
if I manifested myself long after my death. I cannot easily answer
that. Think about it and you will be able to judge how dreadful a
situation I’m still in! However, I believe I must have been led to
that medium by a will not my own. And by some reason that I
can’t explain, I used his hand as easily as I’m using yours right now –
it’s almost as though it actually belongs to me. Right now I’m even
experiencing much pleasure, a sort of special relief, which, alas,
will soon end ... But ... my God! Will I have the strength to make
the confession I know I must?”
        After much encouragement, the spirit added, “I was very
guilty! What tortures me most is being regarded as a martyr, when I
am nothing of the sort ... In a previous life I ordered several victims
to be put into a sack and thrown into the sea ... Pray for me!....”
        Comment by St. Louis on the Communication:
        This spirit’s confession will bring him much relief. Yes, he
really was very guilty! However, his past life was honorable and


                                  300

he was highly esteemed by his bosses. This circumstance was the
fruit of repentance and the good resolutions he had made before
returning to the earth, where he desired to be as humane as he
had formerly been cruel. The devotion he demonstrated was a
reparation, but he had to redeem past wrongs through a final act of
expiation – the cruel death he suffered. He wanted to purify himself
by experiencing the torture he had inflicted on others. Notice that
one idea hounds him: the regret in seeing that he is regarded as a
martyr. Know that such humility will be taken into consideration.
From that moment on, he departed the path of expiation to enter
the path of rehabilitation, upon which your prayers can uphold
him, making his steps firmer and more resolute.

                     François Riquier
        François Riquier was an ordinary, miserly old bachelor, who
died in C... in 1857, leaving a considerable fortune to distant
heirs. For a time he had been the landlord of a lady tenant, who
later forgot all about him and didn’t even know whether he was
still alive or not. In 1862, this lady’s daughter, who was subject to
bouts of catalepsy followed by spontaneous magnetic sleep, and
who was also a good writing medium, saw Mr. Riquier during one
of these sleep periods. He told her that he wanted to say something
to her mother.
        A few days later, he spontaneously manifested and expressed
the wish to communicate to that lady, and we had the following
exchange with him:
        What would you like from us?
        “My money! Those wretches took it to split amongst
themselves! They sold my farms, houses, everything to divide it
all up! They squandered my assets as if they no longer belonged to
me. Make them do right by me. They no longer listen to me and I

                                 301

                          Part 2 - Chapter IV


won’t stand for such villainy. They say I was greedy and have kept
my money from me! Why don’t they give it back if they think it
was ill-gotten?”
       But you are dead, my dear sir, and you no longer need any
money. Ask God to grant you a new lifetime of poverty in order to
expiate your greed from this one.
       “No, I couldn’t live in poverty. I need money to be able
to live. Also, I don’t need another life because I’m still alive
right now.”
       (This question was asked to try to bring him to reality) Are
you suffering?
       “Oh, yes! I am suffering worse tortures than the cruelest
disease, because it is my soul who endures them. I’m constantly
aware of the iniquity of my life, which was the subject of scandal
for many people. I know good and well that I’m a wretch unworthy
of pity, but my suffering is so great that you must help me out of
this miserable situation.”
       We shall pray for you.
       “Thank you! Pray that I may forget my earthly riches.
Otherwise, I’ll never be able to repent. Goodbye and thank you.”
                       François Riquier, Rue de la Charité, No. 14

       It is interesting to see this spirit give his address as though
he were still alive.
       The lady, who did not know anything about the matter,
hurried to verify it and was quite surprised to find that the address
given really was the last house in which Riquier lived. Thus, after
five years he still did not regard himself as dead, and he experienced
the anxiety – terrible for a greedy man – of seeing his assets divided
amongst his heirs. The evocation, undoubtedly caused by some
good spirit, was meant to make him understand his situation and
predispose him to repentance.

                             Claire
                   (Parisian Society, 1861)

       The spirit who furnished the following communications
was that of a woman whom the medium had known while she
was alive, and whose conduct, like her character, fully justified
the torment she was experiencing. Moreover, she was dominated
by an exaggerated sense of pride and self-centeredness – reflected
in her third communication, especially, wherein she expects the
medium to pay attention only to her. The communications were
obtained at different times, and the last three already denote
perceivable progress in the spirit’s disposition, thanks to the care
of the medium, who had undertaken her moral education.
       1. “I’m here – the miserable Claire.” What would you like
me to tell you? Resignation and hope are no more than mere
words to those who know that their sufferings will last throughout
interminable centuries as innumerable as the pebbles on the
seashore. You say that I can soften my suffering? Such empty
words! Where am I going to find the courage and hope to do that?
So, in your narrow minds, try to understand what a day that lasts
forever is like. Is it a day, a year, a century? What do I know? Time
isn’t divided into hours and the seasons don’t change. Eternal and
slow, like water dripping from a rock, this abominable day, this
cursed day weighs upon me like a lead pall. I’m suffering! ... I see
only silent and indifferent shadows ... I’m suffering!
       “But I know that above this misery reigns God, the Father,
the Lord, toward whom everything progresses. I want to think
about him; I want to beg him for his mercy.
       “I struggle and drag myself around like some lame creature
crawling along the path. I don’t know what force keeps drawing
me to you; might you be my salvation? I depart from you feeling
calmer and rekindled; like a shivering elderly person in a ray of

                                 303

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


sunlight, my spirit awakens, my frozen soul gains new life when
close to you.”
       2. “My misery increases every day; it increases as my grasp
on eternity develops within me. O misery! How much I curse you,
you guilty times, times of selfishness and oblivion when I forgot all
charity, all devotion, and thought only of my own welfare! Cursed
be human interests! Vain are concerns for material interests!
Cursed be those who blinded and ruined me! I wither away from
the incessant regret for the time I wasted. What can I tell those
who are listening to me? Watch yourselves constantly; love others
more than yourself; don’t delay your progress on the path of the
good; don’t pamper your body at the expense of your soul. Watch
yourselves, just as the Savior preached to his disciples. Don’t thank
me for these counsels. My spirit conceived them, but my heart has
never listened. Like a whipped dog, fear makes me cower; I do not
yet understand intentional love. Its divine dawn is hindered from
rising! Pray for my parched and miserable soul!”
       3. “Since you seem to have forgotten me, I have come looking
for you. Do you think a few sporadic prayers and simply pronouncing
my name are enough to appease my suffering? No, a hundred times,
no. I roar with pain; I wander about without repose, without refuge,
without hope, feeling the eternal dagger of punishment stab into my
rebellious soul. I laugh when I listen to your complaints; when I see
you sad. What are your ephemeral miseries? What are your tears?
What are your torments that sleep abates? Do I sleep, do I? I want
to, do you understand? ... I want you to leave your philosophical
meanderings and pay attention to me; make others pay attention to
me too. I have no words to describe the anguish that drags on and
on with no hours to divide it up. I see only a tenuous ray of hope,
and this hope you have given me. So don’t abandon me.”
       4. St. Louis: “This picture is completely true and is by no means
exaggerated. You might ask what this woman did to be so miserable.

Did she commit some horrible crime? Did she rob or murder anyone?
No. She did nothing against human justice. On the contrary, she
enjoyed what you might call earthly happiness: beauty, fortune,
pleasure, praise; everything smiled on her; she lacked nothing. On
seeing her, we would say: What a fortunate woman! And we would
envy her luck. So what did she do? She was self-centered. She had
everything except a good heart. She broke no human laws; she broke
God’s laws, because she forgot the first of the virtues: charity. She only
loved herself, and now no one loves her; she gave no one anything, now
she is given nothing; she finds herself isolated, forsaken, abandoned,
lost in the emptiness of space where no one thinks of her or is
concerned about her. That is what comprises her torment. Having
only sought worldly pleasures that are no longer there for her, only
emptiness surrounds her. She sees nothingness, which seems eternal
to her. She does not suffer any physical torture; no demons come to
torment her. But that is unnecessary since she is tormented by herself,
and that is what is most painful to her, for if demons did torment her,
at least they would be paying attention to her. Self-centeredness was
her joy on earth; now it hounds her – a worm that burrows into her
heart – her real demon.”
                                                             Saint Louis

      5. “I will speak to you about the important difference
between divine morality and human morality. The former assists
the adulterous woman in her abandonment and says to sinners,
‘Repent and the kingdom of heaven will open to you.’ Also, divine
morality accepts every repentance and every acknowledgement of
wrong, while human morality rejects them and smilingly accepts
secret sins, which, it says, are partially forgiven. The former
displays the grace of forgiveness; the latter, hypocrisy. So, choose,
you spirits who are avid for the truth! Choose between the heaven
open to repentance and the tolerance that accepts the evil which


                                   305

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


is not disturbed by self-centeredness or false arrangements, but
which rejects the passion and the tears of wrongs openly confessed.
Repent, all you who have sinned; renounce evil; renounce the
hypocrisy that conceals its ugliness under the laughing and
deceptive mask of mutual social conveniences.”
       6. “Now I am at peace and resigned to expiating the wrongs
I committed. Evil is not outside of me; it resides within me. It is I
who must change and not exterior things. We possess heaven and
hell within us, and our wrongs are engraved into our conscience
and are easily read on the day of our resurrection. We are our own
judges, for the state of our soul either abases or elevates us. Let me
explain myself: an impure spirit, burdened by its wrongs, can neither
conceive of nor desire an elevated state that it cannot sustain. Believe
it well: just as the various species of beings live, each one within
the realm that is proper to it, so spirits, according to their degree
of advancement, move about in the environment that is adequate
for their faculties. They cannot conceive of any other realm until
progress, that instrument of the spirit’s slow transformation, rids
them of their inferior tendencies and removes the cocoon of sin so
that they can flutter their wings before launching themselves as fast
as an arrow toward God! Ah! I still crawl, but I no longer hate and
I can now conceive of the ineffable happiness of divine love. So,
continue to pray for me as I hope and wait.”
       In the following communication, Claire speaks about her
husband, who used to give her a great deal of trouble when alive,
and about the position in which he now finds himself in the spirit
world. She was unable to complete this picture herself, so it was
finished by the medium’s spirit guide.
       7. “I have come to you, you who have left me forgotten for
so long. But I have acquired patience and am no longer desperate.
Do you want to know what poor Felix’ state is? He wanders about
in darkness, prey to the profound nakedness of his soul. Superficial


                                  306

                           Suffering Spirits


and frivolous, degraded by sensuality, he never knew what love
and friendship were. Not even passion could illuminate his dark
glimmerings. I would compare his present state to that of a child
who is incapable of functioning in life and who is deprived of the
help of those who could assist him. Felix roams about in fear in
this strange world, where everything shines with the brilliance of
that God whom he used to deny.”
       8. The medium’s Guide: “Claire cannot continue to comment
on her husband’s sufferings without feeling them within herself, so I
shall speak for her.
       “Felix, who was superficial in his thinking as well as in his
sentiments, who was violent because he was weak and dissolute
because he was insensitive, entered the spirit world as naked morally
as he was physically. During his life on earth, he acquired nothing
and, consequently, must start his work all over again. Like a man who
awakens from a prolonged sleep and feels his nerves profoundly
agitated, when this poor being emerges from his confusion, he
will realize that he had lived a life of chimeras, which misled his
existence. Then he will curse the materialism that made him
embrace emptiness instead of reality. He will rue the positivism
that made him regard ideas about the future life as a reverie, the
aspiration to it as insanity, and belief in God as weakness. When
this unfortunate spirit awakens, he will see that the terms he used
to scoff at are the formula of truth, and that, contrary to the fable,
hunting the prey was less profitable than hunting the shadow.”
                                                              Georges

           A Study of Claire’s Communications

      These communications are instructive in that they show us in
particular one of the most common aspects of life: selfishness. They
do not portray the great crimes that terrify even the most perverse


                                 307

                          Part 2 - Chapter IV


individuals, but rather the condition of a huge mass of individuals
who live in this world, honored and venerated solely for having
covered themselves with a certain veneer while sparing themselves
the repressive inconvenience of societal laws. These individuals will
not encounter exceptional punishments and shuddering sights in
the spirit world, but a simple situation instead, one that is natural
and in keeping with the state of their soul and they way they used to
live. Isolation, abandonment and helplessness are the punishment
for those who have lived only for themselves. As we have seen,
Claire was a highly intelligent spirit, but she had an arid heart.
Her social position, her wealth and the physical gifts she enjoyed
on earth attracted praise that gratified her vanity and satisfied her.
Now, she only finds indifference, and emptiness surrounds her: a
punishment more poignant than physical suffering because it is
humiliating. Her pain at least inspires pity and compassion and
is still a means of attracting attention, of making others occupy
themselves with her, of keeping them interested in her fate.
        The sixth message contains a perfectly true idea regarding
the obstinacy of certain spirits in their practice of evil. We marvel
at seeing how some of them are so insensitive to the idea and even
to the sight of the happiness of good spirits. That is precisely the
situation of debased persons, who delight in depravation and in
gross and sensual gratification. Such people are in their element,
so to speak. They cannot conceive of refined forms of enjoyment;
they prefer tattered rags to clean and shining garments because they
feel more at ease in them, and they prefer Bacchic orgies to the joys
of good company. These spirits feel so in tune with this way of life
that it becomes second nature to them, and they believe themselves
to be incapable of rising above their current surroundings. That
is why they remain as such until a transformation of their being
broadens their intelligence, developing their moral sense and
rendering them accessible to more subtle sensations.

                             Suffering Spirits


         When these spirits discarnate, they cannot readily acquire a
delicacy of sentiment and for a longer or shorter amount of time,
they occupy the lower levels of the spirit world, just as they did
on earth. They remain there as long as they rebel against progress,
but with time and the experience, tribulations and miseries of
successive incarnations, they arrive at the moment in which they
perceive something better than what they had until then. They
finally lift their aspirations and begin to understand what they
lacked, and thus start their efforts at ascension. Once on this
path, progress is rapid, for they experience a goodness that is quite
superior, and next to which their former experiences are nothing
more than crude sensations, which now only inspire repugnance.
         (To St. Louis) What are we to understand by the darkness in
which certain suffering spirits find themselves immersed? Is it the kind
of darkness so often referred to in the Scriptures?
         “Essentially, it refers to the darkness described by Jesus and the
prophets regarding the punishment of evil individuals. However, that
was no more than an allegory meant to impress the physical senses
of their contemporaries, who could never understand punishment
in a spiritual sense. Certain spirits are immersed in darkness, but one
should interpret it as a true night of the soul that is comparable to the
intellectual darkness of one who is mentally impaired. It does not imply
insanity of the soul, but rather an unawareness of one’s self and one’s
surroundings whether there is physical light present or not. Principally,
it is the punishment of those who have doubted their destiny. They have
believed in nothingness and the semblance of this nothingness becomes
their torment, until the soul makes an effort to turn itself around and
forcefully breaks through the web of moral weakness that had seized
it, much like those who under the influence of a bad dream struggle
with all of their strength against the terrors that had initially dominated
them. This temporary reduction of the soul to a fictitious nothingness
while it is nonetheless conscious of its own existence is the cruelest


                                   309

                             Part 2 - Chapter IV


feeling that can be imagined due to the apparent repose it presents. It is
this forced repose, this nullity of being, this uncertainty that comprises
its punishment. The weariness that overcomes it is the most terrible of
punishments, for it perceives nothing around it – neither things nor
beings. That is true darkness for the soul.”
                                                                    Louis

        (Claire) “It’s me. I can also respond to the question concerning the
darkness, because I have wandered and suffered for a long time in that
limbo where all is weeping and misery. Yes, the visible darkness of which
the Scriptures speak exists, and the unfortunate souls who, having ended
their earthly trials, die ignorant or guilty, are plunged into that cold
region, unconscious of themselves and their destiny. Since they believe
their situation will last forever, their language still reflects the words of
the life that seduced them, and they marvel and are terrified at their
utter solitude. Such regions are darkness indeed; they are peopled and
deserted at the same time; spaces in which obscure spirits roam around
in mourning, without consolation, without affection, and without any
help whatsoever. To whom could they go? ... They feel the weight of
eternity pressing down on them ... They tremble and mourn the petty
interests on which they spent their time. They regret the absence of
nighttime, which, succeeding the day, carried away their anxieties in a
happy dream. For a spirit, darkness means ignorance, emptiness, the
horror of the unknown ... I cannot continue....”
                                                                      Claire

      We received the following explanation on the subject of
darkness:
      “Because of its nature, the perispirit has a luminous property
that develops under the influx of the soul’s activity and qualities.
One could say that these qualities are for the perispiritual fluid
what friction is for the match. The intensity of a spirit’s light is


                                    310

                              Suffering Spirits


the result of its purity – the least moral imperfection dims and
weakens it. The light radiating from a spirit will be more lively
the more advanced the spirit is. Thus, the spirit is, in a manner of
speaking, its own beacon and will see according to the amount of
light it produces. This means that spirits who do not produce any
light at all find themselves in darkness.
        “This theory is perfectly exact as to the radiation of higher
order spirits’ luminous fluids, and it has been confirmed by
observation, although this does not imply the real cause or, at
least, the sole cause of the phenomenon, given that: first, not all
low order spirits are in darkness; second, the same spirit can find
itself alternately in light and darkness; and third, light is also a
punishment for highly imperfect spirits. If the darkness in which
certain spirits find themselves were inherent to their personality,
such darkness would be permanent and general for all evil spirits,
which is not the case, in that some very wicked spirits can see
very well, whereas other spirits, who could not be regarded as so
wicked, temporarily find themselves in profound darkness. Thus,
everything indicates that, regardless of their own light, spirits also
receive light from the outside, which is denied to them according
to the circumstances. We must therefore conclude that darkness
depends on a cause or an outside will, and that in certain cases it
comprises a special punishment determined by supreme justice.”
        (Asked of St. Louis): Why is the moral education of discarnate
spirits easier than that of incarnates? The relations that Spiritism has
established between incarnates and spirits indicate that the latter are more
quickly corrected under the influence of healthy counsels than is the case
with respect to incarnates, as is demonstrated in the healing of obsessions.
        (Response at the Parisian Society): “In virtue of their very
nature, incarnates are involved in a constant struggle between the
contrary elements of which they are comprised, and which must lead
them to their providential goal by reacting one upon the other. Matter


                                    311

                           Part 2 - Chapter IV


is easily influenced by an outside fluid, and if the soul does not brace
itself against such influence with all the moral power of which it is
capable, it allows itself to be dominated by its body as an intermediary.
Thus following the impulse of the perverse influences that surround
it, its tendencies toward some dominant passion make it very easy for
invisible spirits to subjugate it and attack it at that vulnerable point.
         “For the discarnate spirit it is quite the opposite: it is true
that it still finds itself under a semi-material influence, but it does
not compare to that of the incarnate. Human respect, so customary
among human beings, is non-existent for discarnates, and this
thought alone is enough to compel them not to resist for very long
what the judgment of their own interests indicates as being good.
They can struggle indeed, and they usually do so with even more
violence than incarnates because they are freer, but no thought
of material interest or social position warps their reasoning. They
struggle out of love for evil, but they soon acquire conviction about
their powerlessness toward the moral superiority that dominates
them. The perspective of a better future is more accessible to them
because they are already living a life where that future must occur,
and this awareness is not lost in the whirl of human pleasures. In
other words, freedom from the flesh makes their conversion easier,
especially when they have acquired a certain amount of development
through the trials they have undergone. A completely primitive
spirit would be little accessible to reason, unlike one who has already
had much life experience. Any physical action can momentarily
suspend the sufferings of a wicked individual, but it cannot destroy
the unhealthy principle residing in the soul. Actions contrary to the
betterment of the soul cannot divert it from evil.”

               The Suicide at the Samaritaine70
       On April 7, 1858, at around 7:00 p.m., a well-dressed
man of about 50 years of age appeared at the establishment of
the Samaritaine in Paris and ordered a bath to be prepared. After
about two hours and surprised that the client had not called him,
the steward on duty decided to enter his room to see if he was
indisposed. When the steward entered the room, he saw a hideous
sight: the wretch had slit his own throat with a razor, and the bath
water was saturated with blood. Since the suicide’s identity could
not be verified, the body was taken to the morgue.
       This man’s spirit was evoked at the Parisian Society six days
after his death and gave the following responses:
       1. Evocation
       (Response by the medium’s Guide) “Wait, he is here.”
       2. Where are you right now?
       “I don’t know ... tell me where I am.”
       3. You are at a meeting of people who study Spiritism; we mean
you well.
       “Tell me if I’m alive or not, because I’m suffocating in this
coffin.”

     The Samaritaine takes it name from an old water pump near the Pont Neuf. The pump was
     decorated with the woman of Samaria giving a drink of water to Jesus. – Tr.

       Even though his soul had separated from his body, it is still
completely immersed in what might be called the vortex of corporeal
matter. His earthly ideas are so acute that he thinks he is not dead.
       4. Who urged you to come to us?
       “I feel relieved.”
       5. What drove you to commit suicide?
       “I’m dead? Me? No ... I’m in my body ... You don’t know how
much I’m suffering! I’m suffocating ... I wish some compassionate
hand would finish me off!”
       6. Why didn’t you leave behind any clue that could be used to
identify you?
       “I’m abandoned. I fled suffering only to find torture.”
       7. Do you still have the same reasons for remaining anonymous?
       “Yes. Don’t put the red-hot iron to the bleeding wound.”
       8. Could you give us your name, age, profession and address?
       “Absolutely not.”
       9. Did you have a family, wife, children?
       “I was abandoned. No one loved me.”
       10. What did you do in order not to be loved by anyone?
       “How many there are like me! ... When no one loves him,
a man can feel abandoned even in the midst of his own family.”
       11. When you were about to commit suicide, didn’t you feel any
hesitation?
       “I was eager to die ... I expected rest.”
       12. Why didn’t the thought of your future make you give up
your plan?
       “I didn’t believe in it at all. I had no expectations. The future
means hope.”
       13. What thoughts came to you as you felt your life slipping away?
       “I didn’t think; I felt ... But my life hasn’t come to an end ...
my soul is still connected to my body ... I can even feel the worms
devouring me.”

        “Not as painful as afterward, because only my body suffered
at the time.”
        16. (To St. Louis’ spirit) What does this spirit mean by saying
the moment of death was less painful than afterward?
        “The spirit was ridding himself of the burden that had
oppressed him; he felt delight in the pain.”
        17. Does this state always occur in those who commit suicide?
        “Yes. The suicide’s spirit remains connected to the body until
the time his life was supposed to have ended otherwise. Natural
death is liberation from earthly life; suicide shatters it entirely.”
        18. Does the same apply to accidental deaths, which are
independent of one’s will and which shorten the natural duration of
one’s life?
        “No. What do you understand by suicide? A spirit is only
guilty for its own deeds.”
        The doubt that one has died is very common among
persons who have recently discarnated, and especially among those
who during life did not lift their soul above material concerns.
This phenomenon might seem strange at first but it can be easily
explained. When individuals are put into a somnambulistic state
for the first time and are asked if they are asleep, they nearly
always respond that they are not, which is a logical response: the
questioner has put the question badly by using an inadequate
word. In common language, the idea of sleep is linked to the
suspension of all the sensing faculties; thus, somnambulists, who
think, see and feel and who are aware of their mental freedom,
do not believe they are asleep. And, in fact, they are not asleep
according to the ordinary meaning of the word. That is why they


                                 315

                          Part 2 - Chapter V


respond that they are not asleep until they become familiar with
the proper way in which the phenomenon is to be understood.
The same happens with those who have just died. For them, death
meant the annihilation of the being, and, just like somnambulists,
they still see, feel and speak; thus, they do not regard themselves as
dead. They continue to believe such until they acquire an intuition
about their new state. Because it is never complete, this illusion
is always either more painful or less so, and this leaves the spirit
in a certain state of anxiety. In the above example, it is a veritable
torture due to the sensation of the worms devouring the body.
This experience will last for the length of time which this man
would have lived had he not shortened his life. Such a state is
common among suicides, although it is not always exactly the
same but varies in duration and intensity according to attenuating
or aggravating circumstances. The sensation of the worms and
the body’s decomposition is not just limited to suicides, but
happens quite often among those who lived the material more
than the spiritual life. In principle, no wrong goes unpunished,
although there is no absolute and uniform rule about the means
of punishment.

           The Father and the Conscript
      At the beginning of the war with Italy in 1859, a Paris
businessman and father, held in high esteem by all his neighbors,
had a son who was drafted into the military. Since he could not
exempt his son from the service due to his social position, the
idea occurred to him to commit suicide in order to exempt the
young man as the sole surviving son of a widow. One year later
he was evoked at the Parisian Society at the request of a person
who had known him and who wanted to learn about his fate in
the spirit world.

                                 Suicides


        (To St. Louis) Could you please tell us if it would be possible to
evoke the spirit whom we were just talking about?
        “Yes, and he will be very pleased because it will bring him
some relief.”
        1. Evocation
        “Oh! Thank you! I’m suffering so much, but ... is just. Yet,
he will forgive me.”
        The spirit has difficulty writing; the characters are irregular
and badly made. After the word ‘but’ he stops and tries in vain to
continue; he only manages to make a few indecipherable characters
and periods. It is obvious that he could not write the word ‘God’.
        2. Please fill in the gap with the word you didn’t write.
        “I’m unworthy of it.”
        3. You said you are suffering, and there is no doubt that you
erred in committing suicide; however, hasn’t the reason why you did it
brought you any indulgence?
        “The punishment will not be as long, but the act per se was
wrong nonetheless.”
        4. Would you describe your punishment?
        “I’m suffering doubly: in my soul and in my body. I’m
suffering in my body, even though I’m no longer in possession of
it, like an amputee feels pain in a limb that is no longer there.”
        5. Did you commit suicide solely to exempt your son or were
there other reasons?
        “I was completely led by paternal love, though wrongly so.
In consideration for this, my punishment will be shortened.”
        6. Do you know when your suffering will end?
        “No, I don’t, but I have the assurance it finally will, which
is a relief for me.”
        7. A little while ago you were unable to write the word ‘God’,
but we have seen greatly suffering spirits write it. Is this part of your
punishment?


                                   317

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


       “I will be able to write it after making great efforts to repent.”
       8. Well then! Make such efforts and try to write it; we are sure
that if you succeed in doing so, it will bring you relief. (The spirit
ended up writing the following phrase in crude, irregular and
shaky characters: God is very good).
       9. We are grateful that you came in response to our evocation,
and we will pray for you, asking God to be merciful toward you.
       “Yes, please, if you would.”
       10 (To St. Louis) Would you give us your personal appraisal
about the spirit whom we have just evoked?
       “This spirit is suffering justly, for he lacked trust in God –
a wrong that is always punishable. The punishment would be
terrible and very long if it were not mitigated by the praiseworthy
motive of keeping his son from being exposed to death in war.
God, who is just and sees the depths of the heart, is only punishing
this man according to his deeds.”
       At first glance, this suicide might seem excusable since it may
be regarded as an act of self-sacrifice. Actually, though, this is not
entirely correct. As St. Louis stated, this man lacked trust in God.
Perhaps his action prevented his son’s destiny from being fulfilled;
moreover, he could not be certain that his son would have died in
battle, and maybe this career would have given him an opportunity
to do something that would have been useful for his evolution. The
father’s intentions were undoubtedly good and will be taken into
account. Intention mitigates a bad deed and merits indulgence, but
it does not keep evil from being evil nonetheless. Otherwise, one
could find an excuse for any misdeed whatsoever – one could even
murder under the pretext of rendering a service. Would a mother
who kills her son in order for him to go straight to heaven be less
guilty for having done so with good intentions? According to such a
theory, one could justify all the crimes that have been committed as
a result of the blind fanaticism of religious wars.

                                              Suicides


        In principle, humans do not have the right to dispose of
their own life, for it has been given to them because of the duties
they are to fulfill while on earth, a sufficient reason for them not to
intentionally shorten their life under any pretext. But since they
have free will, no one can keep them from doing so, although
they will always suffer the consequences. The suicide most severely
punished is the one that results from the desperation of seeking to
evade life’s miseries. These miseries are expiations and trials at the
same time, and withdrawing from them is to refuse the task one
has accepted, and, sometimes, even the mission one must fulfill.
        Suicide does not consist solely in the intentional act that
produces instant death; suicide occurs whenever anything is
consciously done that will prematurely hasten the extinction of
the vital forces.
        An act is not regarded as suicide when out of self-sacrifice
one exposes oneself to death in order to save another person’s life;
first, because in that case there is no premeditated intention to
withdraw from life; second, because there is no danger from which
Providence will not rescue us if our time has not yet come. Death
under such circumstances is a meritorious sacrifice because it is a
selfless act on behalf of someone else. (See The Gospel according to
Spiritism, chap. V, nos. 53, 65-67)

       The following communication was given spontaneously at a
Spiritist meeting in Havre on February 12, 1863:
       “Will you take pity on a poor wretch who has suffered
dreadful torture for so long? Oh! The emptiness ... the space ...

I’m falling ... falling ... help me! My God, I had such a miserable
existence ... I was a poor devil; I often suffered hunger in my
old age and so I took to drinking and became ashamed and sick
of it all. I wanted to die, so I jumped ... Oh! My God! What
a moment! Why did I want to put an end to my life if I was
so close to the end anyway? Pray so I won’t have to keep on
seeing this emptiness below me ... I’m going to dash myself upon
those stones! I beg of you; you, who know about the misery of
those who no longer belong to this world. Even though you don’t
know me, I’m addressing you because I’m suffering so ... Why
do you want more proof? I’m suffering! Isn’t that enough? If I
were hungry instead of enduring this terrible suffering, which
is imperceptible to you, you would not hesitate to help me out
with a morsel of bread. So I’m asking you to pray for me ... I can’t
stay long ... Ask any of these happy ones who are here right now
and you will find out who I was. Pray for me.”
                                           François-Simon Louvet

       (The medium’s Guide) “This spirit who has addressed you
just now, my son, was a poor wretch who had to undergo the trial
of poverty, but was overcome with disgust. Courage failed him and
instead of looking to heaven as he should have, he turned to the
bottle and sank to the extremes of despair. He put an end to his
sad trial by jumping off the Tower of Francis I on July 22, 1857.
Take pity on this poor soul. He is not very advanced but he knows
enough about the future life to suffer and to desire a new trial. Pray
to God to grant him grace and you will be doing a good deed.”
       In looking for information on the matter, the following
notice was found in the Journal du Havre of July 23, 1857. We
will summarize it here:
       “Yesterday, at 4 p.m., the transients on the wharf were
dismayed by a terrible incident: a man threw himself off the tower


                                 320

                                        Suicides


and was dashed on the stones. He was an old barge-hauler72, whose
dependence on liquor drove him to suicide. His name was François-
Victor-Simon Louvet. The body was taken to the home of one of
his daughters on Corderie Street. He was 67 years of age.”
        Six years had elapsed since his passing and he still saw
himself falling off the tower and being crushed on the stones
below. The void below and the perspective of the fall still terrified
him – and that after 6 years! How much longer would such a state
last? He does not know, and this uncertainty increases his distress.
Isn’t this like hell with its flames? Who revealed such punishments?
Were they invented? No. The very individuals who must endure
them are the ones who have come to describe them, just as others
have come to describe their joy. They often do this spontaneously
without our thinking about them – which excludes all notions
that we are the victims of our own imaginations.

                             Mother and Son
       In March of 1865, Mr. C., a businessman in a small town
close to Paris, had at home his seriously ill, twenty-one year old
son. Sensing that his time had come, this young man called to his
mother and still had enough strength left to embrace her. Sobbing,
she said to him, “Go ahead of me, my son, for I won’t be long in
following you.” Having said this, she left the room, hiding her face
in her hands.
       The persons who witnessed this contrite scene thought Mrs.
C.’s words were a simple outburst of grief that time and reason
would dispel. After the young man died, they first searched for her
throughout the house and then found she had hanged herself in
the barn. Both mother and son were buried at the same time.

       The son was evoked several days later:
       Did you know that your mother committed suicide out of
despair over losing you?
       “Yes, and were it not for the sorrow her fatal decision has
caused me, I would be perfectly happy. Poor excellent mother!
She couldn’t bear the trial of a temporary separation, and so that
she could be with her beloved son she took the road that would
lead her farthest from him. Alas! And for a long, long time! So
she delayed a reunion for who knows how long, but which would
have been near at hand if her soul had submitted to the will of the
Lord, if she would have resigned herself, humble and repentant
before the trial she had to undergo, the expiation that would
have purified her!
       “Oh, pray! Pray for her! ... And especially you mothers who
are moved by the story of her death: do not follow her example!
Do not believe that she loved her son, her pride and joy, more
than other mothers love theirs. No, she did not love him more;
she lacked courage and resignation. You mothers listening to me:
when agony forces your sons’ eyes to close, remember that, like
Christ, they are mounting Calvary. And from there they shall rise
to eternal glory.”
                                                       Benjamin C.

        Evocation of the mother:
        “I want to see my son! Do you have the power to deliver
him to me? They are so cruel! They took him from me to lead him
into the light while they left me in darkness! I want him; I want
him; he belongs to me! ... So, isn’t a mother’s love worth anything
at all? Well isn’t it?! I carried him in my womb for nine months; I
nursed him, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood; I guided his first
steps; I taught him to utter the sacred name of God and the sweet
word mother. I molded him into a man full of energy, intelligence,


                                 322

                                 Suicides


honesty, uprightness and filial love, just to lose him when he was
about to fulfill my hopes for him, just when a shining future was
opening up before him! No, God is not just. He is not a God for
mothers, for he does not understand their pain and desperation ...
And when I bring death upon myself in order not to be separated
from my child, they steal him from me again! ... My son! My Son!
Where are you?”
        The evoker: Poor mother, we sympathize with your grief.
Nevertheless, you sought a sad recourse to reunite yourself with your
son. Suicide is a crime in God’s eyes and you must know that he
punishes every infraction of his laws. Being kept from seeing your son
is your punishment.
        The mother: “No. I thought that God was better than men. I
didn’t believe in his hell; I believed in the eternal reunion of souls
who love each other the way we did ... but I was wrong ... God is
neither good nor just because he has not understood the enormity
of my grief and my love! ... Oh! Who can give me back my son!
Have I lost him forever then? Mercy! Mercy, my God!”
        The evoker: Now try not to despair so. Remember that if there is a
way to see your son, it is not in blaspheming God as you are doing. Instead
of attracting his mercy, you will bring about an even greater penalty.
        The mother: “They told me I wouldn’t ever see him again, and
I understood that they were taking him off to paradise. And I, am
I in hell then? The hell for mothers? It does exist; I see it so well....”
        The evoker: Your son is not lost forever, believe me. You will
certainly see him again, but you must deserve it by submitting yourself
to God’s will, whereas in rebelliousness you can delay that moment
indefinitely. Listen to me. God is infinitely good but also infinitely
just. He never punishes without cause, and if while you were on the
earth you were afflicted with great pain, it was because you deserved
it. Your son’s death was a test of your resignation; unfortunately, you
failed it while alive, and now, after your death, you are failing it


                                   323

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


again. Do you expect God to reward his rebellious children? God is not
implacable; he always welcomes the repentance of the guilty. If you had
accepted with resignation and humility the trial God sent you through
a momentary separation, and if you had waited patiently for the time
when he would have taken you from this earth, then at the entrance of
the world you now find yourself in you would have immediately seen
your son coming toward you with open arms. You would have had
the joy of seeing him radiant after that time of absence. But what you
did, and what you are still doing at this moment, has placed a barrier
between you and him. Don’t believe that he is lost in the depths of
space; no, he is closer than you think, but there is an impenetrable veil
concealing him from your sight. He can see you; he loves you always
and mourns the sad condition you have fallen into because of your
lack of trust in God. He eagerly waits for the happy moment when he
will be allowed to show himself to you; however, it depends only on
you to hasten or delay that moment. Pray to God and say with me:
“Dear God, forgive me for having doubted your justice and goodness.
If you have punished me, I realize I have deserved it. Please accept my
repentance and submission to your holy will.”
       The mother: “What a light of hope you have just made shine
in my soul! It is like a shining light in the night surrounding me.
Thank you; I will pray ... goodbye.”
                                                                    C...

       Death, even by suicide, did not produce in this spirit the
delusion that she was still alive; she was perfectly aware of her
state. For others, however, their punishment consists exactly in
the delusion that they are still alive, which is caused by the ties
that still keep them bound to their body. This woman wanted to
leave the earth in order to follow her son into the next life, so she
had to be aware that she was actually in that world in order to be
punished by not finding him there. Her punishment consists in


                                  324

                               Suicides


knowing that she does not live corporeally anymore and in being
aware of her situation. Thus, each wrong is punished according to
the circumstances that accompany it, and there are no invariable
uniform punishments for wrongs of the same kind.

             Double Suicide out of Love
               and a Sense of Duty
       The following story appeared in a June 13, 1862 newspaper:
       “A young woman and dressmaker named Palmyre, who lived
with her parents, was endowed with an enchanting appearance
and a most affable character, which made her the object of many
suitors. Of all of them, she preferred Mr. B., who felt a vivid
passion for her. Despite her love for him, she nevertheless thought
it her duty out of deference to her parents to yield to their wishes
by marrying Mr. D., whose social standing was regarded by them
as more advantageous than that of his rival.
       “Mr. B. and Mr. D were close friends and although there
were no bonds of mutual interest between them, they were always
together. The love between B. and Palmyre (who had become
Mrs. D.) did not diminish in the least, and because they made
great efforts to contain it, it grew even more intense. In seeking to
extinguish it, B. decided to marry a young woman who possessed
outstanding attributes and he did his utmost to love her. He soon
realized, however, that such heroic means were powerless to heal
him. Nevertheless, for four years neither he nor Mrs. D. broke
their vows. What they had to suffer is impossible to express because
D., who truly loved his friend, was always inviting him over and
insisting that he stay whenever he tried to leave.
       “One day, the two lovers were brought together by an
unsought-for fortuitous circumstance and they shared the state


                                 325

                         Part 2 - Chapter V


of their souls. They led themselves to believe that death was
the only remedy for the agony they were going through. They
decided to die together and to put their plan into action the next
day, when Mr. D. would be absent from home for a long period.
After having made the final preparations, they wrote a long and
touching letter, explaining that the death they inflicted upon
themselves was the only way they could remain faithful to their
obligations. They ended the letter asking for forgiveness and to
be buried in the same grave.
       “When Mr. D. returned home, he found them asphyxiated.
He respected their last wishes and consented to their bodies not
being separated at the cemetery.”
       When this incident was submitted to the Parisian Society as
a topic for study, a spirit responded:
       “These two suicide lovers cannot yet respond to you. I
see them; they are immersed in confusion and terrified at the
perspective of eternity. The moral consequences for the wrong
they committed will weigh heavily on them through successive
migrations, during which their separated souls will search for
each other constantly, subject to the double torture of having
an intuition of and desire for each other. Once their expiation
is finally complete, they will be reunited forever in the bosom of
eternal love. Within eight days, at your next meeting, you can
evoke them. They will come but will not be able see each other;
profound darkness will separate them for a long time to come.”
       1. Evocation of the female suicide: Can you see your lover,
with whom you committed suicide?
       “I can’t see anything, not even the spirits who roam about
in this place where I am. Such night! Such darkness! What a thick
veil there is before my eyes!”
       2. What sensation did you experience upon awakening after
your death?


                                326

                                              Suicides


       “Odd! I felt both cold and burning. I had ice in my veins
and fire on my brow! A strange thing, an unheard-of mixture!
Fire and ice seemed to consume me! I thought I would die a
second time!...”
       3. Are you experiencing any physical pain?
       “All my suffering is here and here...”
       - What do you mean by here and here?
       “Here in my head, and here in my heart...”
       If one could have seen this spirit it would have been possible
to see her put her hand on her forehead and heart.
       4. Do you believe this situation will last forever?
       “Oh! Forever! Forever! I sometimes hear infernal howling,
horrific voices crying out, ‘It will be like this forever!’”
       5. Well, we can tell you with all certainty that it will not be like
this forever. Through repentance you can obtain forgiveness.
       “What did you say? I couldn’t hear you.”
       6. I will repeat that you can shorten the duration of your
suffering by repenting, and we will help you do so through prayer.
       “I could hear only one word and some vague sounds: that
word was – grace! Is it grace that you wanted to say? You no doubt
spoke of grace to the soul who is passing by me – a poor child who
is crying and hoping.”
       A woman who was present at the meeting and undoubtedly
moved stated that she had said a prayer for this unhappy being and
that she had, in fact, mentally asked God’s grace for her.
       7. You say you are in darkness; can’t you see us?
       “I’m being allowed to hear a few of your words, but I can
only see a black crape73 upon which a weeping face looms from
time to time.”
       8. Even if you cannot see your lover, can’t you nevertheless sense
his presence next to you? He is here, after all.
73
     Crape: a silk fabric of a gauzy texture, having a peculiar crisp or crinkly appearance. – Tr.

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


       “Ah! Don’t speak to me about him. I must forget about him
for the moment so that the image on the crape will be blotted out.”
       9. What image is it?
       “That of a man who is suffering and whose mental existence
on earth I have destroyed for a long time to come.”
       In reading this account, one might first be disposed to find
attenuating circumstances in this suicide, even viewing it as a heroic
act brought about by the sentiment of duty. One must realize,
however, that it was judged differently, and that the punishment of
these guilty souls will be long and dreadful for having intentionally
taken refuge in death in order to flee their trial. Their intent not
to break their marriage vows was honorable and will be taken into
account later on. True merit, however, would have consisted in
resisting temptation, whereas they acted like the deserter who
dodges his duty in the moment of danger.
       As one can see, their punishment will consist in their
searching for each other for a long time without reuniting, whether
in the spirit world or during other earthly incarnations. Additionally,
their punishment is temporarily aggravated by the idea that their
present state will last forever. This perspective is part of their
punishment and thus they were not even allowed to hear the
words of hope that were addressed to them. To those who find
such a punishment too long and terrible – especially since it will
only end after several incarnations – we will say that its duration is
not irrevocably set; it will depend on the way in which they bear
their future trials, for which prayer can greatly help them. They
will be like all other guilty spirits: the arbiters of their own destiny.
Even so, isn’t such a fate still preferable to the eternal, hopeless
damnation to which they would be irreversibly condemned
according to the doctrine of the Church, which regards them as
having been handed over to hell forever, and which refused them
the last rites as obviously useless?

             Louis and the Boot Stitcher
       For seven or eight months, a cobbler named Louis G. wooed
a young female boot stitcher named Victorine R., whom he was
soon to marry; the wedding bans had already been published.
Due to this state of affairs, these two young people considered
themselves to be almost united for good, and for economic reasons,
the cobbler came each day to have his meals with his bride-to-be.
       Louis came as usual one day to have supper at his fiancée’s.
They had a fight over some petty matter, and with both holding
stubbornly to their own opinions, things escalated to the point
where Louis left the table and swore he would never return.
       Nevertheless, the next day he went to ask her for forgiveness.
Night is a good counselor – so the saying goes – but the girl believed
that perhaps the scene from the night before might happen again
after it was too late to remedy the evil. She refused to reconcile.
Neither protests, nor tears, nor desperate pleas could make her
yield. Several days had passed since their quarrel, and Louis hoped
that his beloved would be more reasonable, so he decided to make
one last attempt at reconciliation. When he arrived at her home,
he knocked in a way that let her know it was him, but she refused
to open the door. Renewed appeals on the part of the poor young
man and protests made through the door failed to touch the heart
of his pitiless fiancée. “Farewell, then, cruel girl!” exclaimed the
poor man. “Farewell forever. Just try to find a husband who loves
you as much as I do.” The girl then heard a muffled groan, soon
followed by a thud as if an object had fallen, sliding against the
door. Afterward, all was silent. She thought that Louis had sat
down on the doorstep to wait for her to leave, and so she decided
not to go out while he was still there.
       Around fifteen minutes later, another tenant, carrying a
lantern, came upon the scene and let out a scream, crying for help.

                            Part 2 - Chapter V


Neighbors rushed over, and Miss Victorine, also opened her door.
She let out a cry of horror at seeing her fiancé stretched out on the
floor, pale and lifeless. Everyone hastened to help him, but it soon
became clear that it was all of no use, that he was dead. The poor
young man had buried a knife in his heart and it remained sticking
in the wound.

          (Parisian Spiritist Society, August 1853)

        1. (To the spirit St. Louis) As the unintentional cause of her
lover’s death, was the young woman at all responsible for it?
        “Yes, because she didn’t actually love him to begin with.”
        2. Then, in order to have prevented this unfortunate event,
should she have married him in spite of her repugnance?
        “She was looking for an excuse to break up with him; she
did toward the beginning of the relationship what she would have
done later anyway.”
        3. Then in that case, did her responsibility result from her having
fed sentiments that she herself did not share and which eventually
resulted in the young man’s suicide?
        “Yes, precisely.”
        4. Her responsibility in this case should then be in proportion
to her wrong and thus not as great as if she had willingly provoked
his death.
        “Obviously.”
        5. Is Louis’ suicide excusable due to the torment into which
Victorine’s stubbornness plunged him?
        6. “Yes, because a suicide out of love is less criminal in God’s
eyes than a suicide of someone who wants to be freed from life for
cowardly reasons.”
        (When evoked later, the spirit of Louis G. was asked the
following questions)


                                   330

                                  Suicides


        1. What do you think about what you did?
        “Victorine was an ingrate and I was wrong in committing
suicide because of her. She wasn’t worth it.”
        2. She didn’t love you then?
        “No. At first, she thought she did; she had that illusion;
however, the scene I caused opened her eyes and she was happy at
having found a pretext to get rid of me.”
        3. And you, did you love her sincerely?
        “Only out of passion; that is all, I think. If my love had been
pure, I wouldn’t have wanted to cause her any grief.”
        4. If she knew that you really would kill yourself, would she
have persisted in her refusal?
        “I don’t know. I don’t think so, because she isn’t a bad person.
However, she would have been unhappy and it is better for her
that things turned out as they did.”
        5. When you knocked on her door, did you have the idea to kill
yourself in case of rejection?
        “No. I hadn’t even thought of it; I didn’t think she would
still be so obstinate. It was only when I saw her stubbornness that
I lost my mind.”
        6. It seems that you don’t regret your suicide except for the fact
that Victorine wasn’t worth it. Is that the only feeling you have?
        “For now, it is. I’m still totally confused. It seems like I’m still
at her door, but I’m feeling something else I can’t quite figure out.”
        7. Will you be able to figure it out later?
        “Yes, when my mind clears up. What I did was wrong. I
should have left her alone ... I was weak and am now suffering the
consequences of my weakness. Mind you, passion blinds a man and
makes him do stupid things, and he only realizes it when it’s too late.”
        8. You said you had one regret ... what is it?
        “I was wrong to have shortened my life. I shouldn’t have
done it. I should have endured it instead of ending it before the


                                    331

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


proper time. And now, afterward, I’m unhappy. I’m suffering and
it’s always Victorine who makes me suffer. I seem to still be there at
the door – the ingrate! Don’t talk to me anymore about this. I don’t
want to think about it. It makes me feel really bad. Goodbye.”
        This case once again is a further proof of the justice that
presides over the distribution of punishment according to the
degree of responsibility of the guilty party. Here, the first wrong
is perpetrated by the young woman for having nourished in Louis
a love she did not share. Thus, she bears the greatest part of the
responsibility. As for the young man, he is being punished by the
suffering he endures. However, his punishment is lighter because
he did nothing more than give in to a thoughtless impulse and a
moment of excitement rather than to the cool premeditation of
those who commit suicide in order to evade the trials of life.

                           An Atheist
       Mr. J.-B.D. was an educated man, but saturated to the
core with materialistic ideas. He believed neither in God nor the
existence of the soul. At the request of a relative, he was evoked at
the Spiritist Society two years after his death.
       1. Evocation
       “I’m suffering. I’m a reprobate.”
       2. We have been asked to evoke you on behalf of your relatives,
who want to know about your fate. Tell us if our evocation is agreeable
or painful to you.
       “Painful.”
       3. Was your death intentional?
       “Yes.”
       The spirit writes with extreme difficulty; the handwriting is
large, irregular, shaky and almost illegible. At the outset he shows
his anger by breaking the pencil and tearing the paper.

                                  332

                                 Suicides


        4. Do compose yourself; we will all pray to God for you.
        “I am being forced to believe in God.”
        5. What motive did you have for killing yourself?
        “Weariness of a life without hope.”
        One thinks about suicide when life is hopeless; one also wants
to escape unhappiness at any price. With Spiritism, the future
unfolds and hope is legitimized, leaving suicide without purpose;
moreover, one realizes that through suicide one does not escape
an evil but falls into another one a hundred times worse. That is
why Spiritism already has saved so many victims from committing
intentional death. Extremely guilty are those who, through scientific
sophisms and the so-called name of reason, endeavor to believe in the
desperate idea – the source of so many crimes and evils – that
everything ends at death! They will be responsible not only for
their own errors, but also for all the evils they have caused.
        6. You wanted to escape the vicissitudes of life ... Did you gain
anything? Are you happier now?
        “Why doesn’t nothingness exist?”
        7. Please be so kind as to describe to us as well as possible what
your present situation is.
        “I’m suffering in being obliged to believe in everything I used
to deny. My soul is like a furnace – it is being tormented horribly.”
        8. Where did you get the materialistic ideas you had when alive?
        “In a previous existence, I was evil and my spirit was
condemned to suffer the torments of uncertainty throughout my
life; that is why I killed myself.”
        There is a whole corollary of ideas here. We often ask how there
can be materialists, because having passed through the spirit world
they should therefore have an intuition about it. Well, it is precisely
this intuition that is denied to some spirits, who have preserved their
pride and have not repented of their wrongs. Their trial consists in
acquiring, during corporeal life and through their own reasoning, proof


                                   333

                             Part 2 - Chapter V


of the existence of God and the future life that they have incessantly
in front of them. Often, however, their self-conceit at not believing in
anything above themselves prevails, and they must endure grief until
their pride is overcome and they finally surrender to the evidence.
        9. When you drowned yourself, what did you think would
happen to you? What were you thinking at the time?
        “Nothing. It was nothingness for me. Afterward, I saw that
I hadn’t undergone all my punishment by committing suicide; I
still had more to suffer. ”
        10. Are you now thoroughly convinced about the existence of
God, the soul and the future life?
        “Alas! I am terribly tormented because of it!”
        11. Have you seen your brother?
        “Oh! No.
        12. And why not?
        “Why bring our torment together? Misfortune separates;
fortune reunites; alas!”
        13. Would you feel comfortable at seeing your brother? We could
evoke him and thereby bring you together.
        “No, don’t; I’m too low for that.”
        14. Why don’t you want us to evoke him?
        “Because he isn’t happy either.”
        15. You are afraid of his presence, yet it might be beneficial to you.
        “Not now. Later...”
        16. Do you have any message for your relatives?
        “That they pray for me.”
        17. It seems that in the social circles you used to frequent when
alive, some people shared in your opinions. Would you have anything
to say to them on the subject?
        “Oh! Those wretches! May they believe in another existence!
That is the happiest wish I have for them. If they could understand
my sad situation, it would make them think harder.”


                                     334

                                Suicides


       (Evocation of the brother, who had professed the same
theories but did not commit suicide. Although he too is unhappy,
he is calmer and his writing is clearer and more legible.)
       18. Evocation
       “May the picture of our suffering be a useful lesson to you
and persuade you that another life exists, where one expiates one’s
wrongs and disbelief.”
       19. Can you see your brother, whom we have just finished evoking?
       “No. He is fleeing from me.”
       One might ask how spirits can avoid one another in the
spirit world since there are no physical obstacles or refuges that are
impenetrable to sight. However, everything is relative in that world
and conforms to the fluidic nature of the beings who live there.
Only high order spirits have unlimited perception; it is limited
in low order ones. For the latter, fluidic obstacles are the same as
physical ones. Spirits hide themselves from others by their will,
which acts upon their perispiritual envelope and the surrounding
fluids. Nonetheless, Providence, who watches over each one
individually like a mother over her children, grants or denies this
faculty according to each spirit’s moral disposition. Depending on
the circumstances, it comprises either punishment or recompense.
       20. You are calmer than your brother. Could you provide a
more precise description of your suffering?
       “There on earth, don’t your self-centeredness and pride
suffer when you are obliged to admit your mistakes? Doesn’t your
spirit revolt at the idea of being humbled by someone who points
out your errors? Well, just what do you think a spirit suffers, who,
throughout its entire life, was persuaded that nothing existed
beyond itself and that it was always right? Finding itself suddenly
confronted with the obvious truth, such a spirit feels annihilated,
humiliated. Combined with this is the regret of having for so
long forgotten the existence of such a good and tolerant God. Its


                                  335

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


condition is unbearable; it finds neither peace nor repose; it will
not find even a little quiet except in the moment when divine
grace, that is, God’s love, touches it, because pride has taken hold
of the poor spirit and envelops it entirely. It will need a lot of
time to rid itself of that deadly garment. Only the prayers of our
brothers can help us out of this anguish.”
       21. Do you mean incarnate brothers or do you mean spirits?
       “Both.”
       22. While we were interviewing your brother, one of the persons
here was praying for him. Did this prayer do him any good?
       “It wasn’t a waste. If for now he refuses grace, he won’t
when he finds himself in a state where he will have recourse to
that divine panacea.”
       We see here another kind of punishment. Punishment is thus
not the same for all disbelievers. For this spirit, besides his suffering
is the necessity of recognizing the truths that he reneged on while
alive. His current ideas reveal a certain degree of advancement,
compared to other spirits who persist in denying God. It is already
some sign of advancement and humility to confess that one was
wrong. In a subsequent incarnation, it is more than probable that
his disbelief will give way to the innate sentiment of faith.
       When we delivered the results of these two evocations to the
person who had made the request, we received the following response:
       “Sir, you can’t imagine the huge relief that the evocation of my
father-in-law and my uncle has brought me. We recognized them
perfectly. The writing of my father-in-law, especially, is remarkably
similar to when he was alive, especially during his last few months
with us, when it was jerky and indecipherable. Further confirmation
may be found in the long strokes, initials and various letters, which
are the same. As for vocabulary, expressions and style, the resemblance
is even more striking. For us, the similarity is complete except for
his now greater knowledge of God, the soul and the eternal life that


                                  336

                               Suicides


he so formally denied before. We are therefore perfectly convinced
of his identity. God will be glorified by our firm belief in Spiritism,
and our incarnate and discarnate friends will become better because
of it. The identity of his brother is no less obvious, the immense
change from atheist into believer notwithstanding. We recognize his
character, style and turns of phrase. One word especially grabbed
our attention – panacea – a favorite word of his, which he said and
repeated all the time for all things.
       “I showed the two communications to several persons, who
marveled at their veracity. However, the disbelievers who held the
same opinions as my two relatives want even more categorical
responses. For example, they would like for M.D. to disclose the
place where he was buried, where he drowned himself, how he was
discovered, etc. In order to satisfy and convince them, would it be
possible for you to evoke him again, and if so, to ask the following
questions: where and how did he commit suicide, how long was he
submerged, where was his body found, where was he buried, and
whether a religious or civil funeral was given to him?
       “I beg of you, sir, to provide a categorical response to these
questions, as it is essential for those who still doubt. I am convinced
that great benefit will come of it. I’m ensuring that my letter gets
to you by tomorrow, Friday, so that you can make the evocation at
the Society’s session that same day... etc.”
       We have reproduced the above letter because of the fact that
it confirms the spirits’ identities, and below we have attached our
response to it in order to instruct individuals who are not familiar
with communications from the beyond.
       “...The additional questions you have asked us to address
to the spirit of your father-in-law were incontestably stated with
a praiseworthy purpose in mind – to convince disbelievers –
since you yourself no longer harbor any sentiments of doubt or
curiosity. However, a deeper understanding of the Spiritist science


                                 337

                          Part 2 - Chapter V


would lead you to understand that the questions are superfluous.
In the first place, asking me to have your father-in-law answer
with a categorical response shows that you do not understand the
fact that we cannot control spirits at will. They respond whenever
and however they want, and often only as they are able. Their
freedom of action is greater than when they were alive and they
possess ways of avoiding any mental coercion we might wish to
exert over them. The best proofs of identity are the ones they
themselves furnish spontaneously of their own accord or which
arise from the circumstances. Hence, it is almost always futile
to try to induce them to provide proofs. According to what you
have said, your relative has proven his identity beyond a doubt;
consequently, it is more than probable that he would refuse to
answer questions that he might regard as superfluous and meant
to satisfy the curiosity of individuals who are indifferent to him.
His response could very well be the one received by others in
similar cases: ‘Why are you asking things you already know
about?’ To this I would add that the confusion and suffering he is
experiencing could be aggravated by interrogations of this nature.
It would be like trying to elicit from a very ill person the details
of his life while he can hardly think or speak; it would show a real
lack of consideration for his situation.
       “As for the result you are expecting, you can be sure that
it would be fruitless. The proofs of identity that your father-
in-law has furnished carry more weight because they occurred
spontaneously; no clues were given beforehand. Thus, if these
disbelievers are not satisfied with proofs of this type, they might
be even less satisfied by pre-established questions that could be
suspected of having been born out of complicity. There are persons
who are not convinced by anything, no matter what. They could
see your relative in person with their own two eyes and still affirm
that they are victims of a hallucination.

                               Suicides


      “Sir, a few more words regarding your request for an evocation
to be made on the same day I receive your letter. Evocations cannot
be done on the spur of the moment. Spirits do not always respond
to our appeal. For them to respond, they must be both able and
willing. Additionally, there must be a suitable medium (endowed
with the necessary special aptitudes) available at the time. Finally,
the surroundings must be agreeable to the spirit, etc. In other
words, all the unpredictable yet important circumstances must be
present if one wants to proceed profitably. ”

                            Felicien
       Felicien was a wealthy and educated man, a spirited
poet, of good character, kind, very amiable and completely
honorable. Bad investments had ruined his fortune, and since
he felt his age would not permit him to restore it, he gave
in to discouragement and hanged himself in his bedroom in
December of 1864. He was neither a materialist nor an atheist,
but a man of a somewhat superficial nature and little concerned
about life beyond the grave. Since we had known him intimately
and because we were inspired by sympathy, we evoked him four
months after his death.
       Evocation
       “I mourn the earth. I suffered disappointments there, but
much less than the ones I’m experiencing here. I had marvelous
dreams but I am now beneath the reality of my ideal. The spirit
world consists of a highly mixed society and to make it bearable it
will be necessary to make a good triage. I can’t believe it! What a
sketch of spirit customs could be drawn here! Balzac should get to
work here; it would be difficult, even for him! But I haven’t seen
him ... Where are those great spirits who so forcefully used to curse
the vices of mankind? Like me, they ought to live here for a while

                                 339

                           Part 2 - Chapter V


before going to higher realms. It is a curious pandemonium that I
am delighted to observe as I dwell here.”
       In spite of this spirit declaring to us that he was in a highly
mixed society, and, consequently, amidst low order spirits, we were
surprised at his language, given his type of death, of which he made
no mention. Although everything else seemed to reflect his character
as we knew him, this left us in some doubt as to his identity.
       Could you please tell us how you died?
       “How I died? By the death I chose and which suited me
most. I thought for a long time about what type of death I should
employ to deliver myself from life. But I must admit that in reality
I didn’t gain much from it. I freed myself from material concerns
only to find more serious and painful ones as a spirit. And I can
see no end to them.”
       (To the medium’s Guide) Is this really the spirit of Felicien?
Such nonchalant language by a suicide is really astonishing.
       “Yes, it is Felicien. However, due to a justifiable sentiment
about his situation – which you understand – he didn’t want to
reveal his type of death to the medium. That is why he skirted
the issue. Induced by your question, he finally confessed it but it
afflicted him a great deal. He is suffering greatly as a result of his
suicide and avoids as much as he can all that reminds him of his
disastrous end.”
       (To the spirit) Due mainly to the affection and regard we held
for you, your death affected us all the more because we foresaw its bad
consequences for you. I personally have not forgotten how kind and
good you were to me. I would be happy to show you my gratitude if I
could do something useful for you.
       “And yet, I could not escape the embarrassment of my
financial situation any other way. Right now, all I need are
prayers. Especially pray that I may be freed from these awful
fellow spirits close by. They hound me with their laughter, their


                                  340

                               Suicides


howls and infernal scornful mockery. They rightly call me a
coward, for it is cowardice to renounce life. This is the fourth
time I’ve succumbed to this trial in spite of my strong intent not
to fail ... Fatalism! ... Ah! Pray ... What torment! How wretched I
am! If you pray for me, you will do more for me than what I did
for you while on earth. But the trial I failed at so many times lies
there in indelible features before me! I must attempt it again at
the right time ... Will I be strong enough? Ah! To start life over so
many times! To struggle for so long, to be carried away by events
and to succumb in spite of yourself is heart-breaking, even here!
That is why I need strength. One can get it through prayer, they
say ... Pray for me; I will pray also.”
        Even though this particular suicide was committed as a result
of very common circumstances, it nevertheless displays a special
characteristic. It shows us a spirit who has succumbed many times
to the same trial, which has been renewed with each existence,
and which will be repeated as many times as he lacks the strength to
resist it. It is the confirmation of the principle that, if the purpose
of improvement for which we have incarnated is not reached, we
have suffered without profit and will thus have to start all over
again until we emerge victorious from the struggle.
        (To Felicien’s spirit) Please listen to what I’m about to tell
you and ponder my words. What you call fatalism is nothing but
your own weakness, because if there were such a thing as fatalism,
people would cease to be responsible for their actions. They
are always free and in such freedom lies their greatest privilege.
God did not want to make them into moving, blindly obedient
automatons. If their freedom renders them fallible, it also renders
them perfectible, and it is only through perfection that they will
attain to supreme happiness. Only pride leads people to blame fate
for their earthly misfortunes, when in reality misfortunes result
mostly from their own negligence. You have a striking example of


                                 341

                          Part 2 - Chapter V


this from your last incarnation because you had everything you
needed to be a happy human being: wit, talent, wealth, earned
respect; you had no ruinous vices, but, on the contrary, appreciable
qualities ... How then did you compromise your situation in such
a way? Solely by your lack of foresight. You have to agree that if
you had acted more prudently, if you had known how to content
yourself with the lot apportioned to you instead of seeking to
needlessly add to it, ruin would not have befallen you. There was
no fatalism at all because you could have avoided what happened.
       Your trial consisted in a chain of circumstances that
should have given you not the necessity but only the temptation to
commit suicide. Unfortunately for you, despite your talent and
education you didn’t know how to overcome those circumstances
and you now are suffering the consequences of your weakness.
As you have rightly guessed, the trial will be renewed once
again. In your next incarnation, you will encounter events that
will suggest suicidal ideas to you, and this will continue until
you have triumphed over them.
       Far from accusing fate – which is actually your own doing –
marvel at the goodness of God, who instead of irredeemably
condemning you for your failure the first time, incessantly offers
you the means of repairing it. So you will not suffer forever, but
only for as long as you have not redeemed yourself. While you are
in the spirit state, it depends on you to make a sufficiently strong
resolution to show God that you have sincerely repented, and
you must solicit at every instance the support of good spirits so
that you may return to the earth armored against all temptations.
Once you have achieved this victory, you will walk on the pathway
of happiness much more quickly since you have already made
considerable progress in other areas. It is therefore one more hurdle
to clear and we will help you with our prayers. But they will be
ineffective if you do not second us with your own efforts.”

      (The spirit) “Oh! Thank you! Thank you for such meaningful
exhortations. I needed them all the more since I am worse off than
I had let on to be. I promise I will take advantage of them and
prepare for my next incarnation, this time making sure not to fail.
I long to leave this ignoble place that I have been relegated to. ”

                        Antoine Bell
        Mr. Bell was the cashier at a Canadian bank and committed
suicide on February 28, 1865. One of our correspondents was a
physician and pharmacist living in the same town and provided us
with the following information:
        “I knew Bell for more than 20 years. He was as a quiet man
and the head of a large family. A while back, he began to fanaticize
that he had bought a poison at my pharmacy, which he then used
to kill someone. He came to me several times and begged me to tell
him when he had bought the substance. He was suffering terrible
hallucinations. He couldn’t sleep, accused himself and wailed.
The family lived in constant anxiety from 4:00 p.m. to 9 a.m.,
at which time he would go to the bank, where he kept the books
with perfect regularity and without ever making a single mistake.
He had the habit of saying that he felt like there was some kind of
entity within him who enabled him to perform his bookkeeping
correctly and in order. Whenever he seemed about to come to
grips with how outlandish his ideas were, he would cry out, ‘No,
no; you want to deceive me ... I remember ... it’s all true!’”
        At this friend’s request, he was evoked in Paris on April
17, 1865.
        1. Evocation
        “What do you want with me? To subject me to interrogation?
That would be needless; I’ll admit to everything.”

         2. It isn’t our intention at all to afflict you with indiscreet
questions. We only want to know what your situation is in the world
where you now are, and if we can be of any use ...
         “Ah! If you could, I would be so grateful! I’m horrified at my
crime and am very unhappy!”
         3. We hope that our prayers will ease your suffering. Besides, you seem
to be in a good situation because you have repented, and that is already the
first step toward rehabilitation. God is infinitely merciful and always takes
pity on the repentant sinner. Pray with us. (Here, we said the prayer for
suicides, which can be found in The Gospel according to Spiritism).
         Now, could you tell us what crime you are guilty of? If made
humbly, such a confession will be taken into account.
         “First, let me thank you for the hope you have brought to
my heart. Alas! A long time ago I lived in a town whose walls
were bathed by the Mediterranean. I loved a beautiful girl who
also loved me, but since I was poor I was rejected by her family.
She then informed me that she was getting married to the son of
a merchant, whose dealings went well beyond the two seas; so she
rebuffed me. Mad with sorrow, I resolved to end my life, but not
without first murdering my hated rival in order to satiate my desire
for vengeance. I found violent methods repulsive and was horrified
at the idea of committing such a crime, but my jealousy won out.
The evening before my beloved was to become his, my rival died
of poison, administered by me through the means I found the
easiest. That explains these remembrances of the past ... Yes, I
reincarnated after that, and now I will have to reincarnate again ...
Oh! My God, take pity on my weakness and tears!”
         4. We lament the unhappiness that has delayed your progress and we
are truly sorry for you. But since you have repented, God will take pity on
you. Tell us if you carried out the suicide you intended to commit afterwards.
         “No, and I’m ashamed to admit that hope arose once again
in my heart; I wanted to enjoy the prize of my crime. However,


                                      344

                               Suicides


my remorse betrayed me and I expiated my moment of madness
via the ultimate punishment: I was hanged for it.”
       5. During your latest incarnation, were you at all aware of the
evil deed you had committed in the other one?
       “Only in the final years, which I will explain: I had been
good by nature, and like all murderers in the spirit world, after I
had been submitted to the torment of constantly having to see the
image of my victim – he pursued me as the living embodiment
of remorse – I was finally delivered from him after many years
of repentance and praying. I then began my latest existence,
which I lived peacefully and meekly. I had a vague intuition of
my innate weakness as well as my former wrong, which remained
in my memory in a latent state. An obsessing and vengeful spirit,
however, who was none other than my victim’s father, easily took
hold of me and made me relive in my heart, like a magic mirror,
the memories of the past.
       “Alternately influenced by him and my protecting Guide, I
was both poisoner and the family man who was earning a living
to support his children. In the clutches of that obsessor demon, I
was pushed to commit suicide. I am very guilty – it is true – but
less so than if I had decided by my free will alone. Suicides of
my category, who are too weak to resist such spirit obsessors, are
less guilty and punished less than those who abandon life solely
through their own will. Pray with me for the spirit who so fatally
influenced me, that he may renounce his sentiments of vengeance.
Pray for me too so that I might acquire the strength and energy
needed not to fail in the trial of intentional suicide, to which, I
have been told, I will be submitted in my next incarnation.”
       6. (To the medium’s Guide) Can an obsessor spirit actually
drive someone to commit suicide?
       “Certainly, because obsession, which in and of itself is a kind
of trial, can assume all forms. However, this is no excuse. People


                                 345

                            Part 2 - Chapter V


always have their free will and consequently can yield to or resist
the suggestions to which they are exposed. When they yield, it is
always of their own free will. Furthermore, this spirit is right in
saying that those who commit evil instigated by someone else are
less reprehensible and punished less than when they intentionally
commit it. They are nonetheless not innocent of blame, since the
moment they allowed themselves to be drawn off the moral path
occurred because the good had not yet taken hold in their heart.”
       7. How is it that even though prayer and repentance had freed
this spirit from the tormenting sight of his victim, he could still be
chased by his vengeful obsessor during his latest incarnation?
       “As you well know, repentance is only the first step toward
rehabilitation, and is not therefore sufficient to free the guilty spirit
of all its punishment. God is not content with mere promises;
actions are required to prove the commitment to return to the
upright path. That is why a spirit is submitted to new trials which
strengthen it and which at the same time enable it to acquire an
even greater merit after emerging triumphant. A spirit is open to
the persecution of evil spirits until they sense that it is sufficiently
strong to resist them. Then they leave it alone, for they know their
attacks will be futile.”
       These last two examples have shown us the renewal of the
same trial in successive incarnations for as long as it is not effectively
overcome. Antoine Bell shows us furthermore – as remorse and as
a warning – the highly instructive instance of a man persecuted
by the memory of a crime committed in a previous existence. By
this we have further seen that all existences are in solidarity with
one another, that divine justice and goodness are displayed in
people’s ability to gradually evolve without ever depriving them of
redemption from their wrongs, that wrongdoers are punished by
their own wrongs and that punishment, rather than the vengeance
of God, is the means employed to enable them to progress.

                           CHAPTER VI

                               M

        Repentant Criminals
                              Verger
          (Murderer of the Archbishop of Paris)

       On January 3, 1857, Monsignor Sibour, Archbishop of
Paris, was mortally wounded by a young priest named Verger as he
was leaving the Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont. The criminal
was condemned to death and executed on January 30. Up until the
very end, he showed no feelings of regret, repentance or sensitivity.
       Evoked on the same day of his execution, he gave the
following responses:
       1. Evocation
       “I am still retained in my body.”
       2. Hasn’t your soul completely disengaged from your body?
       “No ... I’m afraid ... I don’t know ... Wait until I can get my
bearings ... I’m not dead, am I?”
       3. Are you sorry for what you did?
       “It was wrong to kill, but I was forced to do it by my nature –
I couldn’t take humiliation ... Evoke me some other time.”
       4. Why do you want to leave already?
       “I would be very scared if I saw him; I’d fear he would do
the same to me.”
       5. But you have nothing to fear because your soul has separated
from your body. Banish all concerns; they’re not reasonable.

                                 347

                           Part 2 - Chapter VI


       “What do you want? Are you always in control of your
feelings? I don’t know where I am ... I’ve lost my mind.”
       6. Try to compose yourself.
       “I can’t because I’m crazy ... Wait! I’m going to try and get
my thoughts back in order.”
       7. If you were to pray, would it help you get your thoughts back
in order?
       “I’m scared ... I wouldn’t dare pray.”
       8. Pray, for God’s mercy is great! We will pray with you.
       “Yes. God’s mercy is infinite. I’ve always believed that.”
       9. Now do you have a better understanding of your situation?
       “It’s so weird that I still can’t figure it out it.”
       10. Do you see your victim as being present?
       “It seems like I hear a voice that sounds like he’s telling
me, ‘I don’t want you around anymore’ ... But it must be my
imagination! ... I tell you, I’ve lost my mind because I can see
my body on one side and my head on the other ... although it
seems that I am alive in space between the earth and what you call
heaven ... I even feel the cold steel of the blade slicing through my
neck ... but that’s only the fear I have of dying ... It seems like there
is a crowd of spirits around me, looking compassionately at me ...
they’re talking to me but I can’t understand them.”
       11. Among those spirits, is there perhaps one whose presence you
find humiliating because of your crime?
       “I would say that there is only one whom I’m afraid of: the
one I struck.”
       12. Do you recall your former lives?
       “No. Everything is vague ... I think I’m dreaming ... Again,
I need to get my bearings.”
       13. (Three days later) Have you gotten your bearings more by now?
       “I now know I no longer belong to your world and I don’t
regret it a bit. I regret what I did, but my spirit is freer. I also know


                                  348

                         Repentant Criminals


there is a series of lives that provide us with knowledge we can use
in order to become as perfect as anyone can be.”
       14. Are you being punished for the crime you committed?
       “Yes. I regret what I did and this makes me suffer.”
       15. How are you being punished?
       “I’m being punished because I realize my wrong and I ask
God to forgive me for it; I’m being punished for my lack of
faith in him, and for knowing that we must not shorten the lives
of our brothers; I’m being punished by the remorse of having
delayed my progress by taking the false path and for not listening
to the cry of my conscience telling me that it is not by killing
that I would reach my objective. But I let myself be dominated
by pride and jealousy. I was wrong and have repented, because
men must always make an effort to control their evil passions –
and I didn’t.”
       16. What feeling did you experience when we evoked you?
       “Pleasure and fear, since I’m not evil.”
       17. What does this pleasure and fear involve?
       “The pleasure of conversing with men and being able to
partially pay for my wrong by confessing it; the fear I wouldn’t
know how to define – a sort of shame at having been a murderer.”
       18. Would you like to reincarnate on the earth again?
       “Yes, I have asked to, and I hope to be exposed often to
being murdered and being in fear of it.”
       After being evoked, Monsignor Sibour said that he had
forgiven the murderer and prayed that he would return to the
good. He also said that, although he had been present at the
evocation, he did not show himself to Verger so that he would not
increase his suffering. The mere fear of seeing his victim was a sign
of remorse and was already a punishment in and of itself.
       (To the Monsignor) When choosing their new existence, do
those who commit murder know they will become murderers?


                                349

                           Part 2 - Chapter VI


       “No. They know that in choosing a life of struggle, it is likely
that they will kill a fellow man, but they do not know whether they
will actually do it or not, for there is almost always an inner struggle.”
       Verger’s situation at the moment of his death is like that of
almost all those who perish as the result of a violent death. The
separation of the soul does not occur all at once, so they remain
in a state of bewilderment and do not know if they are alive or
dead. He was spared the sight of the archbishop because it was not
necessary to excite in him feelings of remorse, whereas others, on
the contrary, are constantly chased by the sight of their victims.
       Verger added to and aggravated the enormity of his crime
by not repenting before dying, and was therefore in full position
to incur so-called eternal damnation. However, he had hardly left
the earth when repentance dawned on his soul; he repudiated
his past and sincerely desired to make reparations. It was not
excessive suffering that drove him to make such a resolution, since
he had not yet had time to suffer; it was thus the sole cry of his
conscience, which he had disregarded while alive, but which he
now hears. Why wouldn’t his repentance be taken into account?
Why would something that could have saved him from hell a few
days before death not be of any value now? Why would God, who
would have been merciful before his death, be without pity a few
hours afterward?
       We might be amazed at how quickly a change of ideas
sometimes occurs in the minds of hardened criminals at the last
minute, and whose passage to the other side is enough to make
them realize the iniquity of their conduct. This outcome is far from
being the general rule; otherwise, there would be no evil spirits.
Since repentance is often quite slow in coming, punishment is
prolonged as a consequence.
       Obstinacy in evil during life is sometimes the result of a pride
that refuses to yield and acknowledge mistakes, because humans


                                   350

                                    Repentant Criminals


are under the influence of matter, which casts a veil over their
spiritual perception and deludes them. When this veil is lifted,
the light suddenly dawns and they find they have sobered up. The
immediate return of better sentiments is always an indication of
some moral progress which only waits for a favorable opportunity
in order to reveal itself. On the other hand, those who persist in
evil for a more or less prolonged period of time after death are
undeniably less evolved spirits in whom the materialistic instincts
have suffocated the seed of the good and for whom the trial of new
existences will be necessary in order for them to amend themselves.

      (Condemned to death by the Assize Court at Aisne74 and
executed on December 31, 1857. Evoked on January 29, 1858)

       1. Evocation
       “I’m here.”
       2. What are your feelings at seeing us?
       “Shame.”
       3. Did you remain conscious up to the last moment?
       “Yes.”
       4. Immediately after your execution, were you aware of your
new existence?
       “I was plunged into great confusion, and I haven’t yet come
out of it. I felt a searing pain and it seemed like it was my heart that
suffered it. I saw something I couldn’t recognize roll at the foot of
the scaffold. Then I saw blood flowing and my pain became even
more acute.”
       - Was it a purely physical pain similar to that caused by a serious
wound; by the amputation of a limb, for example?

        “No. It was more like remorse; a great mental pain.”
        - When did you start feeling it?
        “As soon as I was free.”
        5. Was the physical pain caused by the execution felt in your
body or in your spirit?
        “The mental pain was in my spirit; my body felt the physical
pain, but my spirit, separated from the body, also felt the physical pain.”
        6. Did you see your mutilated body?
        “I saw something formless, which seemed I was still part of;
however, I felt myself intact outside of it; I was myself.”
        - What impressions did this sight make on you?
        “I felt my pain a lot; I was completely lost in it.”
        7. Is it true that the body still continues to live for a few moments
after being beheaded and that the execution victim remains conscious
of his thoughts?
        “The spirit withdraws little by little; the more the material
ties interlace it, the less prompt its separation.”
        8. Some have said that they have seen an expression of anger
and physical movements on certain execution victims’ faces as if they
wanted to speak. Is that an effect of nervous contractions or an actual
act of the will?
        “Of the will, since the spirit hasn’t left yet.”
        9. What did you feel first upon entering your new existence?
        “Unbearable suffering; a sort of acute remorse whose cause
I didn’t know.”
        10. Did you find yourself in the company of your accomplices,
who were executed at the same time?
        “To our disgrace, yes. Seeing one another is a constant
torment; each blames the others for his crime.”
        11. Have you encountered your victims?
        “I see them ... they are happy. Their gaze persecutes me ... I
feel it piercing deep inside of me ... I try to flee it in vain.”

                          Repentant Criminals


       - What feelings do you experience when you see them?
       “Shame and remorse. I myself caused it but I still hate
them for it.
       - What feeling do they experience at your sight?
       “Pity.”
       12. Do they display hatred and the desire for vengeance?
       “No. Their wishes are for my expiation. You can’t imagine the
horrible torture in owing everything to those we hate.”
       13. Do you regret your corporeal life?
       “I regret only my crimes. If I had it to do all over again, I
wouldn’t succumb.”
       14. Was the penchant toward evil in your very nature or were
you influenced more by the environment in which you lived?
       “The tendency toward evil was in my very nature because I
was an inferior spirit. I wanted to ascend too quickly and asked for
more than I was capable of. I thought I was strong and so I chose
a tough trial; but I gave in to the temptations of evil.”
       15. If you had received a solid education, would you have
bypassed a life of crime?
       “Yes, but I had chosen beforehand the conditions into which
I was born.”
       Could you have become a moral man?
       “A weak man, incapable of doing either good or evil. During
my life, I could have corrected the evil of my nature, but I could
not have raised myself up to do the good.”
       16. Did you believe in God while alive?
       “No.”
       Nevertheless, it is said that at the last moment you repented. Is
that true?
       “I believed in a vengeful God ... I was afraid of his justice ...”
       And now is your repentance more sincere?
       “Alas! I can see what I have done.”

      What do you think about God now?
      “I sense him, but I don’t comprehend him.”
      17. Do you think the punishment inflicted upon you on earth
was just?
      “Yes.”
      18. Do you expect to be forgiven for your crimes?
      “I don’t know.”
      How do you intend to redeem them?
      “Through new trials, but it seems like there is an eternity
between them and me.”
      19. Where are you now?
      “I’m in my suffering.
      We mean, in what place?
      “Right next to the medium.”
      20. Since you are here, in what form would you appear to us if
we could see you?
      “In my bodily form: my head separated from my body.”
      Could you appear to us?
      “No. Leave me be.”
      21. Would you tell us how you escaped from the prison at
Montdidier?
      “I don’t know any more ... my suffering is so great that I
have nothing but the memory of my crime ... Leave me be.”
      22. Can we bring any relief to your suffering?
      “Pray for my expiation to come.”

       1. What were you when alive?
       “A faithless monk.”
       2. Was disbelief your only imperfection?
       “It was enough to lead to others.”
       3. Could you give us some of the details of your life? A sincere
confession would be counted in your favor.
       “I was poor and lazy. I entered the order not because I had
a call, but in order to have a position. Being intelligent, I found
myself one. Being influential, I abused my power. Being corrupt,
I corrupted those whom I had the mission of saving. Being cruel,
I persecuted those who seemed to disapprove of my excesses.
Those at peace were disturbed by me; hunger tortured many of my
victims, and their screams were often silenced through violence.
Since then, I have been making expiation and have been suffering
all the tortures of hell; my victims stir up the fires that devour
me. Lechery and insatiable hunger pursue me and thirst burns my
parched lips, without a refreshing drop of water ever falling on
them. All the elements hound me. Pray for me.”
       4. Are prayers offered for the dead imputed to you as they are to
other spirits?
       “You might believe they would be beneficial, but for me they
have the same worth as the prayers I myself pretended to offer. I didn’t
finish my job, so I can’t receive my wages.”
       5. Haven’t you ever repented?
       “A long time ago, but it was only the result of my suffering.
But since I was deaf to the cries of my innocent victims, the Lord
is now deaf to mine. Justice!”
       6. You have recognized the Lord’s justice. Trust in his goodness
and plead for his help.
       “The demons howl louder than I do. Cries choke in my
throat. They fill my mouth with boiling pitch! ... I did it. Oh,
great ... (The spirit cannot write the word God).

       7. Aren’t you sufficiently free of earthly ideas to realize that the
tortures you are experiencing all have a moral cause?
       “I endure them; I feel them; I can see my tormentors;
they all have familiar faces; they all have names that reverberate
in my mind.”
       8. What could have driven you to commit such infamies?
       “The vices with which I was imbued; the brutality of the
passions.”
       9. Haven’t you ever begged for the assistance of good spirits to
help you out of your situation?
       “I can see only the demons of hell.”
       10. Weren’t you afraid of such demons while you were alive?
       “No, not at all; nothingness was my faith; pleasures at any
cost were my worship. The divinities of hell have not abandoned
me; I have consecrated my life to them; they will never leave me!
       11. Can’t you see an end to your suffering?
       “The infinite has no end.”
       12. But God is infinite in his mercy and anything can come to
an end if he wills it.
       “If he wills it!”
       13. Why have you come here to communicate in writing?
       “I don’t know how, but I wanted to talk; I wanted to scream
to relieve myself.”
       14. Haven’t your demons tried to prevent you from writing?
       “No, but they are right in front of me, waiting for me; that
is why I don’t want to stop.”
       15. Is this the first time you have written like this?
       “Yes.”
       Did you know that spirits could approach people like this?
       “No.”
       Then how did you find out about it?
       “I don’t know.”


                                   356

                           Repentant Criminals


       16. What did you experience when you approached me?
       “A deadening of my terrors.”
       17. How did you notice you were here?
       “It was like when one wakes up.”
       18. What did you do to communicate with me?
       “I don’t understand it. But can’t you sense it yourself?”
       19. We’re not talking about me, but about you; try to realize
what you are doing while I’m writing.
       “You are my thought; that’s all I know.”
       20. So you didn’t have the will to make me write?
       “No, I am the one who is writing, but you are thinking
through me.”
       21. Try to understand your situation; the good spirits
surrounding us will help you with it.
       “No. The angels don’t come to hell. You aren’t alone?”
       Look around.
       “I feel I’m being helped to think through you ... your hand is
obeying me ... I’m not touching you, yet I’m holding onto you ...
I don’t get it.”
       22. Ask for the assistance of your protectors. Let’s pray together.
       “Do you mean to desert me? Stay with me; they are going to
seize me again. I beg of you ... Stay! Stay!”
       23. I can’t stay any longer. Come back every day; we will pray
together and the good spirits will help you.
       “Yes, I want mercy. Ask it for me; I can’t do it myself.”
       (The medium’s Guide) “Be of good cheer, my child; he will
be granted what you have asked for, although his expiation is still
far from over. The atrocities he committed are unspeakable and
innumerable; he is all the guiltier because he had intelligence,
education and knowledge to guide him; thus, he failed with full
knowledge of the facts. His suffering is dreadful, but with the help
and example of prayer, it will be softened; he will see that the end


                                   357

                         Part 2 - Chapter VI


is possible and hope will uphold him. God saw that he was on
the path of repentance and granted him the mercy of being able
to communicate in order to be encouraged and comforted. Think of
him often. We will leave him with you to strengthen the good
resolutions that he will conceive with the help of your counsels.
Repentance will awaken in him the desire for reparation, and
he himself will then ask for a new existence on earth to practice
the good instead of evil. When God is satisfied with him and
sees him steady in his resolve, he will enable him to behold the
Divine Light that will lead him to salvation, receiving him into
his bosom like the prodigal son. Have faith; we will help you
accomplish your task.”
                                                          Paulin

       Although he had not actually been reached by human
justice, we have placed this spirit among the criminals, in that
crimes consist of actions per se and not punishment administered
by humans. The same applies in the following case.

              The Castelnaudary Spirit
       In a small house close to Castelnaudary, strange noises and
various manifestations occurred, leading people to believe it was
inhabited by ghosts. Consequently, an exorcism was performed in
1848, but without results. The owner, Mr. D., had moved into it
and died there suddenly a few years later. His son went in to occupy
it right afterward, and upon entering one of the rooms received a
hard slap from an unknown hand. Since he was completely alone
at the time, he had no doubt that it had come from an invisible
source, and so he decided to abandon the house once and for all.
Moreover, there was a local belief that a great crime had been
committed there.

                                358

                           Repentant Criminals


       The spirit who had given the slap was evoked at the Parisian
Society in 1859 and manifested itself in a violent manner despite
all efforts to calm it down. Asked about the matter, St. Louis
responded, “This is the worst kind of spirit; a real monster. We
made him come here but we have not been able to make him write
in spite of all we have said to him. He has his free will, which he
has used very badly.”
       Is this spirit susceptible to improvement?
       “And why not? Aren’t they all, this one as well as all others?
Although some difficulties are to be expected – wretched as he is –
exchanging good for evil will end up touching his heart. First, pray
for him and then evoke him within a month; you will see that a
big transformation will have taken place in him.”
       Later, when evoked him again, the spirit showed himself
to be gentler and, little by little became more submissive and
repentant. Subsequent explanations by the spirit himself and other
spirits revealed that he had begun living in the house in 1608.
There he murdered his brother out of a suspicion of jealous rivalry,
stabbing him in the throat while he slept, and then some years
later he murdered the one he had made his wife after his brother’s
death. He had died in 1659 at the age of 80 without having
answered for his crimes, which had aroused little attention during
that tumultuous time. Ever since his death, he had never ceased
practicing evil and had caused several accidents in the house. A
seeing medium who attended the first evocation saw him as he was
being compelled to write; he shook the medium’s arm violently.
He had a dreadful appearance, wearing a blood-soaked shirt and
holding a dagger.
       1. (To St. Louis) Please be so kind as to describe this spirit’s type
of torment.
       “It is atrocious for him; he has been condemned to live in
the house where he committed his crimes. They are continually


                                    359

                            Part 2 - Chapter VI


before him and he cannot think about anything else; thus, he
believes he is condemned to such torture forever. He constantly
sees himself at the times when he committed the crimes; all other
memories have been taken from him and all communication with
other spirits proscribed. While on earth he cannot be anywhere
but in that house, and if he goes into space, he is enveloped in
solitude and darkness.”
        2. Is there any way to dislodge him from the house? If so, what
would it be?
        “When people want to break free of obsessive spirits like
this one, it is easy to do so by praying for them, which is precisely
what people so often fail to do. They prefer to try and scare them
away with exorcisms, which for such spirits is a source of great
entertainment.”
        3. By suggesting to the interested parties the idea to pray for
him, and if we ourselves also pray, will this dislodge him?
        “Yes, but notice that I said to pray and not to request prayers.”
        4. He has been in this situation for two centuries. Has he perceived
the passage of time in the same way as if he were alive; that is, does time
seem longer or shorter to him now than when he was alive?
        “It seems longer to him: sleep does not exist for him.”
        5. We have been told that time does not exist for spirits and that
to them a century seems like an instant in eternity. Doesn’t this apply
to all spirits?
        “No. Indeed, it is the case only with spirits who have reached
a very high degree of advancement. For less evolved ones, time is
frequently very long, especially when they are suffering.”
        6. Where did this spirit come from before his incarnation?
        “He lived among the fiercest and most savage tribes; before
that, he lived on a planet less advanced than the earth.”
        7. This spirit is being severely punished for the crimes he
committed. If he had lived among cruel tribes, he must have


                                    360

                           Repentant Criminals


committed acts that were no less atrocious than the last ones. Wasn’t he
also punished for them?
       “He was punished but not as severely because he was more
ignorant and did not understand the full range of his crimes at the time.”
       8. Is the situation in which this spirit now finds himself that of
those commonly called “the damned”?
       “Absolutely not, for there are spirits who are in an even more
dreadful situation. Suffering is far from being the same for everybody,
even for similar crimes. It varies according to how accessible the
guilty spirit is to repentance. For this particular spirit, the house
where he committed his crimes is his hell; others contain their own
hell within themselves – unappeasable passions torment them.”
       9. Notwithstanding his low advancement, this spirit is sensitive
to the effects of prayer. We have seen this to be equally true in other
perverse spirits of a more brutal nature. How is it possible that more
enlightened spirits, whose intelligence is more developed, show a
complete lack of good sentiments: those who scoff at everything most
sacred; in other words, those whom nothing affects and who never give
cynicism a rest?
       “Prayer is only profitable for the spirit who repents. For
those who out of pride revolt against God and persist in error by
exacerbating it – as unhappy spirits do – prayer can do nothing,
nor will it do anything until one day a spark of repentance begins
to manifest in them. The ineffectiveness of prayer is yet another
punishment for them! Prayer relieves only those who are not
completely hardened.”
       10 If one perceives that a spirit is inaccessible to the benefits of
prayer, is that a reason not to pray for it?
       “Certainly not, for sooner or later prayer could triumph over
its hardheartedness and enable good thoughts to germinate in it.”
       It is the same with certain illnesses: the effects of medications
take time and cannot be determined immediately; with others,


                                   361

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


however, the effect is immediate. If one is convinced of the truth
that all spirits are perfectible and that none are fatalistically and
eternally destined to evil, one understands that sooner or later
prayer will have an effect on them. What seems ineffective at
first glance nonetheless plants beneficial seeds within them that
predispose them to the good even if it does not touch them
immediately. Consequently, it would be a serious mistake for one
to become discouraged if success is not immediate.
       11. If this spirit were to reincarnate, in which category of
individuals would he be found?
       “That would depend on him and his repentance.”
       Several conversations with this spirit resulted in a remarkable
moral transformation. Here are a few of his responses:
       12. (To the spirit) Why couldn’t you write the first time we
evoked you?
       “I didn’t want to.”
       Why didn’t you want to?
       “Ignorance and brutishness.”
       13. So, can you now leave the house at Castelnaudary whenever
you wish?
       “I am allowed to because I have profited from your good
counsels.”
       Have you experienced any relief?
       “I have begun to have hope.”
       14. If we could see you, what would you look like now?
       “You would see me in a shirt but without the dagger.”
       Why wouldn’t you have your dagger any longer? What did you
do with it?
       “I cursed it, and God has spared me having to look at it.”
       15. If Mr. D.’s son (the one who received the slap) were to
return to the house, would you hurt him again?
       “No, because I have repented.”


                                 362

                          Repentant Criminals


       And if he still intended to defy you?
       “Oh! Don’t ask me that! I wouldn’t be able to control myself;
it would be above my strength ... for I’m just a poor wretch.”
       16. Can you foresee the end to your suffering?
       “Oh! Not yet. Thanks to your intercession, it is already
enough – even though I don’t deserve it – to know this suffering
will not last forever.”
       17. Please describe your situation before we evoked you the first
time. Do understand that our request is a way to make ourselves useful
to you; it’s not simply idle curiosity.
       “I told you already that I was unaware of anything besides my
crimes, and that I couldn’t leave the house where I had committed
them except to go up into space, where everything around me was
solitude and darkness. I wouldn’t be able to give you an idea about
it, because I myself could never understand it. Whenever I would go
up into space, everything was dark and empty; I didn’t know what
it was. I am presently experiencing a great deal of remorse and am
no longer forced to remain in that house of death. I am allowed to
wander around on the earth and to seek to enlighten myself with my
observations. I better understand the enormity of my crimes, and if
I’m suffering less on the one hand, my torment is growing on the
other due to my remorse. But at least I have hope.”
       18. If you had to begin another physical existence, which one
would you choose?
       “I haven’t seen enough or reflected much to know.”
       19. During your long isolation – and one might even say
captivity – did you feel any remorse?
       “Not the least, and that’s why I suffered for so long. It was
only when I began to feel remorse that, unbeknownst to me, the
circumstances appeared that led to your evocation – an incident
to which I owe the beginning of my deliverance. So thank you for
taking pity on me and for enlightening me.”


                                  363

                         Part 2 - Chapter VI


       We have seen misers suffer at the sight of gold, which had
become no more than a true chimera for them; prideful spirits
tormented by jealousy at honors they saw being bestowed on
someone else and not on them; men who had been rulers, humbled
by an invisible power that forced them to obey and by the sight of
their subordinates, who no longer knelt before them; atheists who
were experiencing the anguish of uncertainty, finding themselves
in absolute isolation amidst the immensity and not meeting one
being who could enlighten them. In the world of spirits, if there
are rewards for every virtue, there are also punishments for every
wrong, and the wrongs that escaped human laws are always reached
by the laws of God.
       We should also point out that equal wrongs, though
committed in identical circumstances, may be punished
quite differently, depending on the spirit’s level of intellectual
development. The lowest order spirits of a brutal nature – like
the one we have just now concerned ourselves with – are inflicted
with punishments that are to some extent more physical than
mental, while the opposite applies to those whose intelligence
and sensitivity are more developed. For the former, a punishment
is required that is suited to the coarseness of their exterior so
that they may grasp the disadvantages of their situation and be
inspired to get out of it. Consequently, shame alone, for example,
would make little or no impression on the former but would be
intolerable to the latter.
       In the divine penal code, the wisdom, goodness and foresight
of God toward God’s creatures are revealed even in the smallest
things; everything is proportioned and combined with admirable
solicitude in order to facilitate the means of rehabilitation. Their
soul’s smallest good aspirations are taken into consideration.
According to the dogma of eternal punishment, on the contrary,
great and small criminals are all mixed together in hell: one-time


                                364

                          Repentant Criminals


criminals as well as one-hundred time offenders, the hardened ones
as well as the repentant. Everything is calculated to keep them at
the bottom of the pit. No life preserver is offered to them. One
single wrong can make them wind up there, without taking into
account the good they have done. So, on which side is true justice
and true goodness found?
       The above evocation has nothing fortuitous about it because
it was intended for the benefit of that unfortunate spirit. Seeing
that he had started to comprehend the enormity of his crimes,
the spirits who were looking after him deemed that the moment
had come to offer him effective help, and so brought about the
propitious circumstance. This is something we have seen happen
over and over.
       We asked what would have happened to this spirit if he
could not have been evoked, and what happens to all the other
suffering spirits who cannot be evoked, or what happens to those
we do not even know about. We received the answer that God
has innumerable means for saving such creatures – evocation is
one means of helping them but it certainly is not the only one –
and that God forsakes no one. Thus, collective prayers should
exert their share of influence over all spirits who are susceptible
to repentance.
       God cannot make the fate of suffering spirits depend on the
goodwill and understanding of humans. Ever since human beings
were able to establish regular connections with the invisible world,
one of the primary aims of Spiritism has been to teach adherents the
service they can render to their discarnate brothers and sisters through
such connections. In this way, God willed to show them the solidarity
that exists among all beings in the universe, and to provide a law of
nature as the basis for the principle of fraternity. By opening up this
new field for the exercise of charity, God has shown them the truly
useful and serious side of evocations after ignorance and superstition


                                  365

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


had kept them from their providential purpose until now. There
has never been a lack of help for suffering spirits in any age, and if
evocations have opened up for them a new way of salvation, they have
perhaps profited incarnates even more. They provide them with new
opportunities for doing good, while at the same time they enlighten
them about the conditions of the future life.

                       Jacques Latour
      (Murderer condemned by the Assize Court of Foix and
executed in September of 1864)

       A female medium was asked to write during a private Spiritist
meeting of seven or eight persons in Brussels on September 13,
1864. We were present at the meeting also. Although no specific
evocation had been made, the medium began to trace out the
following words in very large characters and with great agitation
after ripping the paper violently:
       “I repent! I repent! Latour.”
       We were all surprised by this unexpected communication
because no one had elicited it. In fact, no one had even thought
about this unfortunate spirit, nor had most of those present
known about his death. Nevertheless, we spoke compassionate and
encouraging words to him and then asked the following question:
       Since we did not evoke you, what motive led you to manifest
here instead of somewhere else?
       The writing medium was also a speaking medium and
responded vocally:
       “I saw that you were compassionate souls and that you
would take pity on me, whereas others either evoke me more out
of mere curiosity than charity, or else they avoid me out of horror.”
       Then an indescribable scene followed, which lasted about
half an hour. In addition to her speech, the medium’s gestures and

                                 366

                          Repentant Criminals


facial expressions made it clear that the spirit was attuning himself
with her: at times, his desperate voice was very heartrending; he
painted his anguish and suffering with such a very disturbing
tone and his supplications were so vehement that all present were
profoundly touched.
       Some of those present were actually frightened by the
medium’s overexcitement, but we were of the opinion that a spirit
who repents and begs for pity does not pose any danger. Since
he was borrowing the medium’s organs, it would be better to
determine his situation and show an interest in his fate (unlike
the case with obsessing and possessing spirits, who seek to seize
mediums in order to dominate them). Obviously, this particular
manifestation had been allowed for the spirit’s own benefit and
perhaps for the edification of the meeting’s participants.
       The spirit cried out:
       “Oh! Yes, take pity! I really need it, for you don’t know what
I’m suffering! ... No, you don’t know; you cannot understand it ...
It’s horrible! ... The guillotine! ... What was the guillotine when
compared with what I’m experiencing now? Nothing! It was just a
moment. But this fire that is devouring me is worse; it is a continual
death; it is a suffering without rest or repose ... without end!
       “And my victims are all there around me, showing me their
wounds ... persecuting me with their stares! ... They’re there in
front of me ... I can see all of them ...Yes, all ... I can see them all;
I can’t avoid them! And this sea of blood! ... And this gold stained
with blood! ... Everything is there ... always right in front of me!
Can you sense the smell of blood? ... Blood, always blood! ... There
they are, my poor victims; they’re begging me ... and without
mercy, I strike them ... I strike again ... I strike without stopping ...
The blood is intoxicating! ...
       “I believed that after my death everything would be over,
and that’s why I braved it; I braved God himself, denying him


                                  367

                            Part 2 - Chapter VI


altogether! ... And when I thought I would cease to exist forever, a
terrible awakening occurred ... Oh yes, terrible! ... I’m surrounded
by corpses with menacing faces ... my feet wade in blood ... I
thought I was dead but I’m alive! ... It’s dreadful! ... It’s horrible!
More horrible than all the tortures of earth!
       “Ah! If all men could know what is waiting for them after
death! They would know what it will cost them to do evil! There
would be no more murderers, no criminals, no malefactors! I
would wish that all murderers could see what I’m seeing, what I’m
having to go through ... Oh! No, there would no more ... it’s awful
to suffer what I’m going through!
       “I know full well that I deserve it, my God, for I showed no
mercy to my victims. I knocked their imploring hands aside when
they begged me to spare them ... Yes, I was surely cruel; I killed them
like a coward to get their gold! ... I was impious; I denied you; I
blasphemed your holy name ... I wanted to deceive myself and that’s
why I wanted to convince myself that you didn’t exist ... Oh, my God!
I’m a huge criminal! Now I understand. But won’t you take pity on
me? ... You are God, so you are goodness and mercy! You are almighty!
       “Have mercy, Lord! Oh! Mercy! Mercy! I beg of you, do
not be unbending! Free me from this hateful sight, these horrible
images ... this blood ... of my victims; their stares pierce me to the
heart like daggers.
       “You who are here listening to me, you good souls, charitable
souls ... Yes, I see you and you’ll take pity on me, won’t you? You’ll
pray for me ... Oh! I beg of you! Don’t reject me. Ask God to take this
horrible spectacle from my eyes; he will listen to you because you are
good ... I beg of you; don’t cast me aside as I did others ... Pray for me.”
       The participants were deeply touched by his remorse and
spoke words of comfort and consolation. God (he was told) is not
unbending; what he requires from the guilty is sincere repentance
and the desire to repair the evil they have done. Since your heart


                                    368

                          Repentant Criminals


is not hardened and you have asked for forgiveness for your
crimes, God’s mercy will be shed upon you if you persevere in
your good intentions to repair the evil you did. Of course, you
cannot restore to your victims the lives you took from them, but
if you ask fervently, God will allow you to meet them during a
new incarnation in which you will be able to show them as much
devotion as you once showed them cruelty. And when God deems
your reparation to be sufficient, you will re-enter into his grace.
So, the length of your punishment is in your own hands and it
depends on you yourself to shorten it. We promise to help you
with our prayers and to call upon the assistance of good spirits for
you. We will now recite on your behalf a prayer from The Gospel
according to Spiritism for suffering and repentant spirits. We will
not recite the one that refers to evil spirits, because, since you have
repented, besought God and renounced evil, you seem to be no
more than an unfortunate spirit, not an evil one.”
      After we said the prayer and after a few moments of quiet,
the spirit continued:
      “Thank you, my God! ... Oh! Thank you! You have
shown me mercy ... Those horrible images are moving away ...
Don’t forsake me ... Send me your good spirits to support me ...
Thank you.”
      After this scene the medium felt exhausted and weary for
some time. Her limbs were aching. At first, her memory of what
had happened was confused, but little by little she began to recall
a few of the words she had said in spite of herself – she felt it had
not been she herself who had spoken.
      The following day during another meeting, the spirit
manifested again, and for a few minutes he repeated the scene
of the day before, with the same expressive but much less violent
pantomime. Then, with feverish movements he wrote the following
words through the same medium:


                                 369

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


      “Thank you for your prayers. I’m already feeling considerable
improvement. I have so fervently prayed to God that he has
momentarily granted that my suffering be relieved; yet, I will see
them again, my victims ... There they are! There they are! ... Do
you see the blood? ... (We repeated the prayer from the previous
day. The spirit continued addressing us through the medium).
      “Forgive me for having seized you. Thank you for the relief you
have provided for my suffering. Forgive all the harm I have caused
you, but I had to express myself and you were the only one ...
      “Thank you! Thank you! I am already feeling some relief,
but I am not at the end of my trials. My victims will return soon.
That is my punishment; I deserve it, my God, but be indulgent.
      “All of you, please pray for me; take pity on me.”
                                                               Latour

      One member of the Parisian Spiritist Society prayed for this
unhappy spirit and evoked him on different occasions, receiving
the following communications:

                                  I

       “I was evoked almost immediately after my death, but
I couldn’t communicate right away; so a lot of frivolous spirits
assumed my name and took my place. I took advantage of the
president of Parisian Society when he was in Brussels, and with the
permission of superior spirits, I was able to communicate.
       “I will come to the Society and make disclosures that will
act as a beginning for repairing my wrongs. They might also serve
as a lesson for all the criminals who will read and reflect about the
account of my suffering.
       “The church’s description about punishment in hell
produces little effect in the spirits of the guilty. Such images may be


                                 370

                          Repentant Criminals


frightening to children and weak men, but criminals don’t believe
in them. A great criminal is not a cowardly spirit and his fear of
the cops is more real for him than a description of the torments of
hell. That is why all those who read my account will be struck by
my words and suffering. It’s not just some made-up fiction. There
is not one single priest who can say, ‘I’ve seen what I’m telling you;
I myself have witnessed the tortures of the damned.’ But when I
say, ‘this is what happened after the death of my body; see how
disappointed I was when I realized I wasn’t dead like I expected,
that what I had taken to be the end of my suffering was only the
beginning of my indescribable tortures!’ more than one will stop
on the brink of the precipice into which he is about to fall, and
every wretch I drive off the criminal path will serve to redeem one
of my wrongs. That is how good can result from evil and how
God’s mercy manifests everywhere, on the earth as in space.
       “In order to communicate with you, I’ve been delivered from
the sight of my victims, who had become my executioners. But after
leaving you, I will have to see them again, and that idea alone causes
me suffering I can’t describe. I’m pleased when you evoke me because
then I can leave my hell for a few instants. Keep praying for me always;
pray to the Lord that he may deliver me from the sight of my victims.
       “Yes. Let’s pray together. Prayer does so much good! ... I feel
more relieved. I don’t feel as much of the weight of the burden that
encumbers me. I see a spark of hope lighting my eyes. I have fully
repented and proclaim: Blessed is the hand of the Lord and may
his will be done!”

                                  II

       (The medium) Instead of asking God to deliver you from the
sight of your victims, I invite you to pray with me so that you can ask
him for the strength to bear up under that expiatory torture.

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


       (Latour) “I would prefer to be freed from my victims’ sight.
If you only knew what I’m suffering! The most insensitive man
would be moved if he could see the sufferings of my soul imprinted
like fire on my face. But I will do as you advise. I understand it
to be a way to expiate my wrongs a little faster. It’s like a painful
operation that will restore my gravely diseased body’s health.
       “Ah! If the guilty of the earth could see me, how frightened
they would be of the consequences of their crimes; they may be
hidden from the eyes of men but they are seen by spirits! How fatal
ignorance is for so many!
       “What a great responsibility is assumed by those who refuse
education to the poor classes of society! They think they can
prevent crime with a police force. How wrong they are!”

                                 III

      “My suffering is terrible, but after your prayers I felt assisted
by good spirits, who told me to have hope. I understand the power
of the noble remedy you have prescribed. This harsh expiation is
equal to the evil I committed, and I ask God to grant me strength
to bear up under it. I don’t mean to excuse my atrocities, but
except for the few instants of terror that preceded each one of
my victims’ death, at least their pain ceased once the crime was
committed, and those who had finished their earthly trial received
the recompense awaiting them. But since my own return to the
world of spirits, I have not stopped suffering the pains of hell, save
for the very short instants in which I have manifested myself.
      “Despite their frightening images of punishment for
reprobates, priests only have a very faint idea of the true suffering
that divine justice inflicts on children who have broken the law of
love and charity. How can anyone make reasonable people believe
that an immaterial soul can suffer in contact with material fire? It’s

absurd and that is why so many criminals laugh at the fantastic
portrayals of hell. But the same doesn’t apply to the mental pain
endured by the condemned after physical death.
      “Pray for me, that desperation may not take possession of me.”

                                    IV

       “I am deeply grateful to you for the glorious destination you
have enabled me to foresee – I’ll get there when I’m purified. I’m still
suffering a lot, yet it seems like it’s getting less. I can’t believe that in
the world of spirits pain gets less and less as we grow used to it. No. I
understand that your benefic prayers have increased my strength and
even though my pain is the same, my strength is greater and so I suffer less.
       “I remember my last lifetime, the wrongs I could have avoided
if I had known how to pray. I now understand the power of prayer;
I understand the strength of those honest and pious women, weak
in the flesh but strong in faith. I understand the mystery that the
supposed learned people on earth do not comprehend: Prayer!
That word alone arouses laughter in strong spirits. I am waiting for
them, and when the veil concealing the truth is torn from them,
then in their turn they will come to prostrate themselves at the feet
of the Eternal One whom they despised, and they will be happy to
humble themselves so they can redeem their sins and crimes! Then
they will understand the virtue of prayer.
       “To pray is to love; to love is to pray! Then they will love
the Lord and will direct their prayers of love and gratitude to him.
Regenerated through suffering – because they will suffer indeed –
they will pray like me to have the strength to redeem themselves.
And once they have stopped suffering, they will pray to thank
the Lord for the forgiveness they will have merited through their
submission and resignation. Let us pray, my brother, so that I may
become stronger ...

                         Part 2 - Chapter VI


       “Oh! Thank you for your charity, my brother, because I
have been forgiven. God has delivered me from the sight of my
victims. O My God! Blessed are you for all eternity for the grace
you have granted me! O My God! I feel the enormity of my
crimes and I bow down before your omnipotence. Lord! I love
you with all my heart and beg that it be your will to grant me
the grace to undergo new trials on earth, to return to it as a
missionary of peace and charity, to teach children to pronounce
your name with respect. I ask you to enable me to teach them
to love you, who are the Father of all creatures. Oh! Thank you,
my God! I am a repentant spirit and my repentance is sincere.
I love you as much as my impure heart can comprehend such
sentiment – love is the pure emanation of your divinity. Brother,
let us pray because my heart is overflowing with gratitude. I’m
free, I’ve broken my chains and I’m no longer a reprobate. I’m
a suffering yet repentant spirit, and would like for my example
to stay all the criminal hands I see on the threshold, ready to be
raised in crime. Oh! Stop, my brothers, stop! The torment you
are preparing for yourselves will be atrocious. Do not believe
that the Lord will be quickly moved to pity by the prayers of his
children. Centuries of torment are waiting for you.”
       The medium’s Guide: You say that you do not understand
this spirit’s words. Try to take into account his emotions and his
gratitude toward the Lord. He believes he could not express or
testify to them better than by trying to stop all those criminals,
whom he can see but whom you cannot. He would like his words
to reach them, but what he did not tell you – because himself he
is unaware of it – is that he will be allowed to begin a reparatory
mission. He will join his accomplices once more and will seek to
inspire them to repentance and will introduce the seed of remorse
into their hearts. On earth, one sometimes sees individuals thought
to be honest throw themselves at the feet of a priest in order to

                         Repentant Criminals


confess a crime. Remorse has told them to confess their wrong.
If the veil that hides the invisible world from you were lifted, you
would often see a spirit who has been the accomplice or instigator
of a crime come to seek to amend his wrong – as Jacques Latour
will – by inspiring remorse in incarnate spirits.
                                              Your Protector Guide

      The same medium who had received Latour’s first manifestation
in Brussels later obtained the following communication:
      “You don’t have to fear me any more; I’m much calmer,
although I’m still suffering. God has had compassion on me
because he has seen my repentance. I am now suffering from my
repentance; it has shown me the enormity of my crimes.
      “If I had received better guidance while alive, I would not
have done all the evil I did. But my instincts were not repressed,
so I obeyed them without restraint. If all men would think more
about God, or if they would at least believe in him, they would not
commit similar crimes.
      “Human justice, however, is badly administered; for one
wrong – sometimes a minor one – a man is condemned to prison,
which is always a place for perdition and perversion. He leaves it
completely lost because of bad advice and examples. Even if his
character is good and strong enough to resist these bad examples,
on leaving prison he finds that all doors are shut to him, all helping
hands are withheld; all honest hearts reject him. What is left?
Contempt and poverty, abandonment and desperation if he has
made the good resolution to return to the good. But poverty drives
him in everything, and now he also despises his fellow creatures.
He hates them and loses his sense of good and evil altogether
because he finds himself rejected – he, who has made the decision
to become an honest man. In order to get what he needs, he steals,
sometimes kills ... then the guillotine!

       “My God, the moment my hallucinations are about to
imprison me again, I feel your hand extending over me; I sense
your goodness surrounding and protecting me. Thank you, my
God! In my next life, I shall employ my intelligence and the
goodness in me to help poor wretches who have succumbed and
to keep them from the fall.
       “I thank you [the medium] for not having loathed
communicating with me; have no fear; you can see that I’m not
evil. Whenever you remember me, don’t picture me as I once was,
but as a poor afflicted soul who is thankful for your acceptance.
       “Goodbye; evoke me again and pray to God for me.”
                                                            Latour

                     (Study on the Spirit of Jacques Latour)

       It is impossible to ignore the profoundness and great
significance of some of the words contained in the above
communication. Furthermore, it offers one of the aspects of
the world of punished spirits, above which one can nevertheless
perceive the divine mercy. The mythological allegory of the
Eumenides75 is not as ridiculous as one might think, and the belief
in demons, who, with their horns and forks, have replaced them
in the modern belief system as the official torturers of the invisible
world, is less rational than these victims who serve as their own
instruments of punishment.
       In accepting the identity of this spirit, one might be
astonished at such a prompt change in his moral state. As we
pointed out on another occasion, there is often more willingness
in a brutally evil spirit than in one who is dominated by pride or
one who hides its vices under the coat of hypocrisy. This prompt
change to better sentiments indicates a nature more primitive than
75
     The furies of Greek myth (Webster’s) – Tr.



                                                  376

                         Repentant Criminals


wicked, and which is only lacking in good guidance. In comparing
this spirit’s language with that of the spirit mentioned below under
the heading Punished by the Light, it is easy to conclude which
of the two is more evolved morally, in spite of the difference
in their education and social standing. One obeyed a natural
instinct of ferocity – a sort of over-excitement – whereas the other
approached the perpetration of his crimes with the calmness and
cold-bloodedness of a slow and persevering premeditation; even
after his death he was full of pride as he faced his punishment. The
latter suffers but does not accept his punishment, while the former
immediately submits to it. Thus, we can foresee which one of the
two will suffer for a longer time.
       “I am now suffering,” says the spirit of Latour, “from my
repentance; it has shown me the enormity of my crimes.” This
displays a profound thought: a spirit does not really comprehend
the gravity of its misdeeds until it has repented. Repentance leads
to regret, to remorse – a painful sentiment that is the transition
from evil to good, from moral malady to moral health. It is
to avoid this painful transition that wicked spirits stand firm
against the voice of their conscience, like ailing patients who
refuse the medicine that will heal them. They seek to delude
themselves by persisting in evil. Latour reached the point where
his hardened hearted began to crumble. Remorse entered it;
repentance followed; he understood the extent of the evil he had
committed; he saw his vileness and suffered for it. That is why
he says: “I am now suffering from my repentance.” During his
next-to-last incarnation, he should have been worse than during
his last one, since if he had repented back then as he has now,
his life would have been better. The resolutions he has made in
the present will influence his future earthly life; as criminal as his
last incarnation was, it nevertheless marked a stage of progress
for him. It is highly probable that, during his errant state before


                                 377

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


his last incarnation, he was one of those rebellious spirits who
persisted in evil, as one often sees.
        Many people have asked what advantage we may derive
from previous existences, since we neither remember them nor
have any idea about who or what we were.
        This question is completely resolved due to the fact that if
the evil we committed is effaced and no trace of it remains in our
heart, then remembering a past existence would be useless because
we do not need to concern ourselves with it any longer. As for the
evils from which we have not entirely freed ourselves, we can know
about them through our current tendencies, and it is to them that
we must turn our entire attention. It is sufficient to know who we
are, without it being necessary to know who we were.
        When one considers how difficult it is during life for the most
repentant guilty spirits to rehabilitate themselves, the reprobation of
which they are the object, we ought to praise God for having thrown
a veil over the past. If Latour had been condemned to serving time,
or even if he had been acquitted, what he had done or had been
accused of would have made him an outcast from society. Despite
his repentance, who would have wanted to make him part of their
inner circle? The sentiments he now displays as a spirit give us hope
that in his next life he will be an honest, esteemed and respected
individual. However, suppose people were to discover that this
individual had been Latour: he would remain an outcast. The veil
thrown over his past opens the door to his rehabilitation; he will be
able to sit without shame or fear among the most honest people.
After all, how many persons would at any cost want to be able to
erase from people’s memory certain years of their life!
        What doctrine better harmonizes with the goodness and
justice of God than this one! Moreover, this doctrine is not a
theory but the result of observation. Spiritists did not dream it up.
No, they witnessed and observed the various situations in which


                                 378

                         Repentant Criminals


the spirits presented themselves, they sought the explanations that
were given to them, and from these explanations the doctrine arose.
Therefore, if Spiritists have accepted the doctrine, it is because it
is the result of actual observation and has seemed to them more
rational than all the other theories presented up until now on the
future of the soul.
       One cannot deny that these communications convey a lofty
moral teaching. The spirit could have been, or probably was, assisted
in his reflections – especially in his choice of expressions – by more
highly advanced spirits; however, in similar cases, such spirits only
influence the style and not the essence, and they never put a less
advanced spirit in contradiction with itself. Thus, in Latour’s case,
they might have refined the expression of his repentance, but they
could not have coerced him to express repentance against his will,
because a spirit has its free will. They perceived in him the seed of
good sentiments, and that is why they helped him express himself,
thereby contributing to the development of these sentiments while
at the same time asking for commiseration on his behalf.
       Is there anything more touching, more moral, more capable
of making a vivid impression than the picture of this great repentant
criminal expressing his desperation and remorse? Amidst their
tortures, and persecuted by the incessant sight of their victims,
who would not lift their thought to God and beg for mercy? Isn’t
this a worthy example for the guilty? We can understand the nature
of his anguish: it is rational and terrible, though simple and devoid
of phantasmagoric acting.
       One might feel surprised at such a huge transformation in a
spirit like Latour. But why wouldn’t he repent? Why wouldn’t he
be endowed with an emotional cord? Would the guilty thus always
be devoted to evil? Would a moment not arrive in which the light
began to dawn on their soul? This moment had arrived for Latour,
and that is precisely the moral side of his communications. It is


                                 379

                          Part 2 - Chapter VI


the understanding of his situation, his regrets and his plans for
reparation, which are eminently instructive. Would one find it
extraordinary if Latour had sincerely repented before his death, if
he had said before he died what he said afterward? Don’t we have
numerous examples of this?
       A return to the good before his death would have appeared
to most of his peers to be a sign of weakness, but his voice from
beyond the grave is the revelation of the future that awaits them
too. He is absolutely correct when he states that his example will
be more effective for regenerating the guilty than the perspective
of the flames of hell or the scaffold. Why not give this example to
those who are in prison? It would cause more than one to ponder
the matter. We have already had many examples of it. But how can
anyone believe in the effectiveness of a dead man’s words when one
believes that when one dies it is the end? Yet, the day will come in
which everyone will realize this truth: the dead can come back to
instruct the living.
       Many other important teachings can be taken from these
communications. First, it is the confirmation of the principle
of eternal justice, by which repentance is not enough to place
the guilty in the ranks of the elect. Repentance is the first step
toward rehabilitation – it attracts divine mercy. It is the prelude to
forgiveness and the abbreviation of suffering. However, God does
not absolve unconditionally; expiation is required, and especially
reparation. This is what Latour has understood and for what he is
preparing himself.
       Second, if we compare this criminal with the one from
Castelnaudary, we will find a great difference in the punishments
inflicted upon them. The latter’s repentance was slow in coming
and, consequently, his punishment lasted longer. Moreover, his
punishment was almost physical, while Latour’s was more mental.
As we stated earlier, in one the intelligence was less developed


                                 380

                       Repentant Criminals


than the other, requiring something that could strike his obtuse
senses; however, mental punishments are no less pungent for
those who have reached the level desired to comprehend them.
One can infer this fact from the complaints Latour himself
articulates. They are not the result of anger, but are rather an
expression of remorse, soon followed by repentance and the
desire for reparation in order to evolve.

                         Lapommeray
                  (Punishment by the Light)
       During one of the Parisian Society’s sessions in which the state
of confusion that usually accompanies death was being discussed, a
spirit whom no one had even mentioned or had intended to evoke
spontaneously manifested itself in the following communication.
Although it was not signed, it was easily recognized as that of a great
criminal who had recently been struck down by human justice.
       “What are you saying about confusion? Why such pointless
words? You are dreamers and utopians. You are completely
ignorant about the subject you claim to be concerned about. No,
gentlemen, there is no confusion except in your own minds. I am
as dead as I can be, but I can see clearly within me, around me –
everywhere! ... Life is a dreary comedy! Foolish are they who exit
the stage before the curtain falls! ... Death is terror, punishment,
yearning, depending on the weakness or strength of those who
fear it, brave it or beg for it. For all it is bitter exasperation! The
light dazzles me and pierces like a sharp arrow into the essence of my
being ... I was first punished with the darkness of the jail cell and
I was then believed to be punished with the darkness of the grave
or the punishments dreamed up by Catholic superstitions ... Well,

                                 383

                           Part 2 - Chapter VII


it is you, my good gentlemen, who are experiencing darkness,
whereas I, a social misfit, find myself on a plane above you ... I
shall be who I am! ... Strong in thought, I scorn the warnings that
resound around me ... I can see clearly ... Crime! It’s just a word!
Crime happens everywhere. When it is committed by the masses,
it is glorified; by an individual, it is condemned. How absurd!
        “I don’t want to be pitied ... I ask for nothing ... I am self-
sufficient and I shall find out how to fight against this hateful light.”
        He who yesterday was a man
        In this communication (analyzed in the session that
followed), one recognizes in the very cynicism of the language
a profound teaching, and one can see in the situation of this
unhappy spirit a new aspect of the punishment awaiting the guilty.
In fact, while some are indeed immersed in darkness or complete
isolation, and while others endure the anguish of their final hour
for many years or believe themselves to still be in this world, the
light shines for this spirit. He enjoys the full use of his faculties;
he knows perfectly well that he is dead and does not complain
about anything; he asks for no assistance and continues to affront
the divine and human laws. Will he thus escape punishment?
No. God’s justice is accomplished under many forms, and what
causes joy for some is a torment for others; the light he mentions
is his torture. He rebels against it, and despite his pride, he admits
to his rebellion when he states, “I am self-sufficient and I shall
find out how to fight against this hateful light,” and also when
he says, “The light dazzles me and pierces like a sharp arrow into
the essence of my being.” The words, “the essence of my being,” are
characteristic; he recognizes the fact that his body is fluidic, that it
can be penetrated by the light from which he cannot escape, and
that that light pierces him like a sharp arrow.
        This spirit has been placed in this chapter among the
hardened ones because it took him a long time to show the


                                   384

                           Hardened Spirits


slightest repentance. This is evidence that moral progress does not
always accompany intellectual progress. Little by little, however, he
began mending his ways and later provided wisely reasonable and
instructive communications. Today he could be ranked among the
repentant spirits.
       Requested to evaluate the matter, our spirit guides dictated
the three following communications. They are worthy of serious
attention.

                                  I

       From the point of view of existences, errant spirits may be
obviously regarded as being in an inactive and waiting state. Even
so, however, they can still expiate past wrongs, provided their pride
and restless persistence in their errors do not hold them back at the
moment of progressive ascension. You have a grim example in the
communication of this hardened criminal as he struggled against
the divine justice that had captured him after human justice. In
such cases, instead of being useful by making them aware of the
profound significance of their wrongs, expiation – or rather the
baleful suffering that oppresses these spirits – incites them to
rebelliousness, causing them to protest, which Scripture, in its
poetic eloquence, calls gnashing of teeth. An image par excellence!
The sign of a humiliated yet defiant sufferer! Lost in pain, the
rebellious spirit is still strong enough to refuse to recognize the
truth about punishment and reward!
       Great errors – as well as highly criminal consciences –
almost always persist in the spirit world. To continue to challenge
the infinite and to be oneself in spite of everything resembles the
blindness of men and women who, like the Galls at the time of
Alexander, gaze up at the stars and believe them to be arabesques
on a ceiling.

       The moral infinite exists! Miserable and small are those
who, in the pretext of continuing their abject earthly struggles and
boastfulness, can see no farther in the other world than they did
on earth! For them there is only blindness, contempt for others;
mean and egotistical personalities delaying their own progress! It
is so true, O humankind, that there is a secret accord between the
immortality of a pure name bequeathed to the earth and the true
immortality preserved by spirits in their successive trials.

        Doesn’t plunging someone into darkness or into waves of light
actually lead to the same result? In either case, he can see nothing
around him, and he will become accustomed more rapidly to the
darkness than to the dull electrifying brightness in which he may be
immersed. Thus, the spirit who communicated during the last session
expresses the truth of his situation very well when he exclaims, “Oh!
I shall find out how to fight against this hateful light!” Actually, such
light is all the more terrifying and all the more frightening since it
pierces him completely, rendering his most secret thoughts visible
and apparent. This is one of the most severe aspects of his spiritual
punishment. He finds himself committed, so to speak, to the glass
house Socrates requested. That is still a valuable teaching, for what
would have consisted in joy and consolation to the sage has become an
infamous and continuous punishment for the perverse, the criminal,
the parricidal spirit, bewildered in his own person.
        My children, can you surmise the suffering and terror which
must seize those who during their entire sinister lives took great
pleasure in planning and plotting the most heinous crimes deep in their
hearts – into which they withdrew like wild animals inside their dens –
and who today find themselves expelled from that inner lair, where


                                   386

                            Hardened Spirits


they had shielded themselves from the gaze and the scrutiny of their
contemporaries? Now this spirit’s mask of impassibility has been torn
away, and each one of his thoughts is reflected right there on his brow!
       Yes, henceforth, there will be no repose, no refuge for this
great criminal. Every evil thought – and God knows when his
soul expresses it – betrays him outside and inside as if driven by
a high-voltage electric current. He wants to evade the crowd, but
the hateful light unrelentingly pierces him. He wants to flee, and
runs a gasping and desperate course through immeasurable space,
but everywhere, the light is there! Everywhere, eyes plunge into
him! And he rushes again in pursuit of darkness, in search of the
night, but darkness and night no longer exist for him. He calls for
death to assist him but death is no more than a meaningless word.
This unfortunate spirit is constantly on the run! He flees toward
spiritual insanity – a dreadful punishment! Awful pain! There he
will struggle with himself in order to escape from himself, for such
is the supreme law beyond the earth: it is the guilty spirit who
becomes its own most merciless punishment.
       How long will this state last? Until the moment in which
his will, finally defeated, bows down before the poignant grip
of remorse, and when his haughty brow humbles itself before
his appeased victims and before the spirits of justice. Notice the
superior logic of the immutable laws, according to which this
spirit will accomplish – by an act of his own will – what he wrote
last Friday in that haughty communication so clear, so lucid and
so disconcertingly egotistical.
                                                                 Erastus

                                  III

      Human justice does not take into account people’s individuality
when it punishes. By measuring the crime by the crime itself, it strikes


                                  387

                           Part 2 - Chapter VII


lawbreakers indiscriminately; the same punishment afflicts the guilty
without distinction of gender or education. Divine justice proceeds
differently, however: punishments correspond to the degree of progress of
the beings on which they are inflicted. Equality of crimes does not imply
equality between spirits; two guilty spirits with the same indictment
can be differentiated by dissimilar trials, which may plunge one into
the intellectual opacity of the lowest initiatory circles, while the other
- having gone beyond such circles - enjoys the lucidity that exempts it
from confusion. Therefore, it is no longer darkness that punishes, but
rather the keenness of the spiritual light that pierces its earthly mind
and makes it feel the pain of an open wound.
       Discarnate beings who are haunted by the physical sight
of their crime suffer a shock like physical electricity: they suffer
through their senses. Those who are already dematerialized in
spirit feel a much greater pain, which, in its flood of bitterness,
destroys the remembrance of the effects, leaving nothing but the
awareness of their causes.
       Despite the criminality of their actions, individuals can
thus possess an inner progress, in which, while their passions
make them act like a brute, their aroused faculties can raise them
above the heavy atmosphere of the lower layers. The absence of
judiciousness and balance between their moral and intellectual
progress produces the frequent anomalies that occur at times of
materialism and transition.
       The light that tortures the guilty spirit is thus precisely the
spiritual ray that floods the secret recesses of its pride with clarity
and uncovers the inanity of its fragmented being. These are the
first symptoms and anxieties of spiritual agony. They announce
the separation or dissolution of the intellectual and material
elements that compose the primitive human duality, but they
must disappear in the grand unity of the accomplished being.

       The three previous communications, obtained simultaneously,
complement one another and portray punishment under a
new aspect that is eminently philosophical and rational. It is
probable that the Spirits, wanting to address this subject by
employing an example, caused the spontaneous communication
of this guilty spirit.
       Alongside this fact-based picture and in order to establish a
parallel, let us see the image a preacher drew of hell during Lent at
Montreuil-sur-Mer in 1864:
       “The fires of hell are millions of times more intense than
those of earth, and if one of the bodies that burns there without
being consumed were to be cast out onto the planet, it would
infect it from one end to the other! Hell is a vast and dark cavern,
full of pointed needles, keen swords and sharp-edged razors, into
which the souls of the damned are hurled.”
       (See Revue Spirite, July, 1864, p.199)

           Angele – Uselessness on Earth
                       (Bordeaux, 1862)

      A spirit presented itself spontaneously to the medium under
the name Angele.
      1. Have you repented for your wrongs?
      “No.”
      Then why have you come?
      “To try to do so.”
      Aren’t you happy then?
      “No.”
      Are you suffering?
      “No.”
      Then what do you lack?

                                 389

                            Part 2 - Chapter VII


       “Peace.”
       While admitting that their mental state is unbearable, some
spirits consider suffering to be only that which reminds them of
physical pain.
       2. How is it that you lack peace in the spirit life?
       “Regret of the past.”
       Regret of the past means remorse. Have you repented then?
       “No. It is for fear of the future.”
       What are you afraid of?
       “The unknown.”
       3. Would you be willing to tell me what you did during your
last existence? Perhaps that would help me to enlighten you.
       “Nothing.”
       4. What was your social position?
       “Middle class.”
       Were you married?
       “I was a wife and mother.”
       “Did you zealously fulfill the duties of both positions?
       “No. My husband and kids bored me.”
       5. How did you spend your life?
       “Entertaining myself as young girl, getting bored as a young
woman.”
       What were your occupations?
       “None.”
       Who looked after your house?
       “The maid.”
       6. Isn’t it in this uselessness that you might find the cause of your
regrets and fears?
       “Maybe you’re right.”
       Agreeing is not enough. Would you like to atone for that useless
existence by helping the guilty spirits suffering around us?
       “How?”


                                    390

                           Hardened Spirits


      By helping them improve themselves with your counsels and
prayers.
      “I don’t know how to pray.”
      We will do it together; you will learn. Would you like to?
      “No.”
      Why not?
      “It’s tiresome.”

           Instructions by the Medium’s Guide

       We teach you by showing you the various degrees of suffering
and the position of spirits condemned to expiation according to
their wrongs.
       Angele was one of those individuals without initiative,
whose lives are as useless to others as to themselves. Loving only
pleasure, incapable of seeking an education and, in the fulfillment
of her familial and social duties, lacking those satisfactions of the
heart that make life so appealing because they belong to all ages,
she was unable to spend her youth on anything but frivolous
distractions. And when more serious obligations arose, the world
was empty around her because she had placed emptiness into her
heart. Committing no serious wrongs, but displaying no special
qualities either, she made her husband miserable, compromised
her children’s futures and ruined their well-being by her negligence
and indifference. She perverted their hearts and judgment by
her example and by abandoning them to the care of household
servants, whom she hadn’t even put forth the effort to choose. Her
life was unfruitful and therefore blameworthy, for evil originates
from neglecting the good. You must all understand that it is not
enough to abstain from error: you must also practice the virtues
that oppose it. Study the Lord’s teachings; meditate on them and
understand that although they may present a barrier that detains


                                 391

                            Part 2 - Chapter VII


you on the edge of the evil path, they force you at the same time to
retreat and take the opposite path that leads you to the good. Evil
is opposed to the good. Thus, those who wish to avoid evil must
choose the opposite path; otherwise, their life becomes useless;
their works are dead, and God our Father is not the God of the
dead, but the God of the living.
        May I ask what Angele’s next-to-last existence was?
        “She lived in beatific indolence and the uselessness of the monastic
life. Lazy and selfish by nature, she next wanted to try out family life,
but her spirit had evolved very little. She continually rejected the inner
voice that showed her the danger, and since sliding down the slope
was gentle, she preferred to abandon herself to it instead of making an
effort to stop herself at the beginning. Presently, she still understands
the danger involved in maintaining herself in such neutrality, but she
doesn’t feel the strength to attempt the least amount of effort to leave
such a condition. Pray for her; awaken her and force her eyes to open to
the light: it is a duty; do not neglect any duty.
        “Human beings have been created to be active. The activity
of the spirit: that is their essence; the activity of the body: that is a
necessity. Therefore, fulfill the requirements of existence as a spirit
destined to eternal peace. Since your body is meant to serve your,
it is nothing more than a machine subordinate to your intelligence.
Work to cultivate your intelligence so that it may provide a healthy
impulse to the instrument that must aid it in the fulfillment of its
task. Grant it neither rest nor repose, and keep in mind that the peace
to which you aspire will only come after work. Thus, the more you
neglect work, the longer the anxiety will be for you while waiting.
“Work. Work without stopping. Fulfill all your duties without
exception; fulfill them with zeal, with courage, with perseverance,
and your faith will uphold you. Those who consciously perform
the most ungrateful and vile tasks in your society are a hundred
times more elevated in the eyes of the Omnipotent than those who

                          Hardened Spirits


impose such roles on others while neglecting their own. They are all
steps to be climbed toward heaven: don’t crush them beneath your
feet. Know that you are surrounded by friends who are reaching out
to you and who uphold those who put their strength in the Lord.

                       A Bored Spirit
                       (Bordeaux, 1862)

       This spirit presented itself spontaneously to the medium,
demanding prayers.
       1. What has led you to demand our prayers?
       “I’m tired of wandering around aimlessly.”
       Have you been in such a situation for a long time?
       “About a hundred eighty years.”
       What did you used to do on earth?
       “Nothing good.”
       2. What is your status among other spirits?
       “I am among the bored ones.”
       But that does not comprise a category in and of itself.
       “Amongst us, everything comprises a category. Every
sensation finds its similar, and sympathetic counterparts band
together.”
       3. Since you were not condemned to suffering, why have you
remained for so long without progressing?
       “I have been condemned to idleness, which among us is
suffering. Anything that is not a joy is suffering.”
       So have you been forced to remain errant against your will?
       “There are causes too subtle for your material intelligence.”
       Try to explain them to me; it will be a beginning for you to
become useful.

                                393

                           Part 2 - Chapter VII


       “Since I have no terms for comparison, I couldn’t. An
extinguished life on earth bequeaths to the spirit who has not profited
from it what fire bequeaths to paper that it has consumed: sparks,
which recall what the still-compacted ashes used to be and where
they came from, that is, the destruction of the paper. These sparks
are the remembrance of the earthly ties that bind the spirit until it has
dispersed the ashes of its body. Only then does the spirit regain itself as
an ethereal essence and desire to begin progressing once again.”
       4. What might have caused the boredom you complain about?
       “The consequences of my existence. Boredom is the child
of idleness; I didn’t know how to employ the lengthy years I spent
on earth, and the consequences have been reflected in this world.”
       5. Can’t spirits like you, who are wandering prey to boredom,
emerge from such a state if they want to?
       “No, they cannot always do so, because boredom has
paralyzed their will. They are suffering the consequences of their
existence; they are useless and wanting of initiative, and seek
no help from each other. They are left to themselves until the
weariness of their idle state makes them desire to change it; then,
at the slightest awakening of their will, they find support and good
counsel to assist them in their efforts to persevere.”
       6. Could you tell me something about your earthly existence?
       “Alas! Very little. You must understand. Boredom, uselessness and
idleness result from laziness, which in turn is the mother of ignorance.”
       7. Didn’t your previous lifetimes enable you to improve?
       “Yes, all of them, but very slightly since they were reflections
of one another. There is always progress, but it is so imperceptible
that we don’t even notice it.”
       8. While you are waiting for a new existence, would you be
willing to come to me more often?
       “Evoke me. I will be constrained to come; you will render
me a service.”

                           Hardened Spirits


        9. Can you explain why your handwriting changes so frequently?
        “Because you ask a lot of questions; that tires me out and I
need help in order to write.”
        The medium’s Guide: It is mental effort which tires him,
and which obliges us to help him so that he can respond to your
questions. He is as idle in the spirit world as he was on the earth.
We brought him to you in order to attempt to pull him out of
his apathy and boredom, which is true suffering and sometimes
more painful than acute pain would be because it can prolong
itself indefinitely. Can you imagine the torment of the perspective
of endless boredom? Most of the spirits of this category look
for an earthly existence only as a pastime and as a means to break
the unbearable monotony of their spirit life. That is why they
frequently enter their earthly lives without any definite resolution
to foster the good, and this in turn obligates them to start all over
until finally true progress is felt.

                   (Died in France in 1858)

        1. What sensations have you experienced since you left the
terrestrial world behind?
        “I would not be able to say; I am still experiencing some
confusion.”
        Are you happy?
        “I miss earthly life ... I do not know ... I am experiencing
poignant pain from which earthly life would set me free ... I wish
my body would rise from the grave...”
        2. Do you regret having been buried among Christians and not
in your own country?
        “Yes, Indian soil would weigh less on my body.”

                                 395

                           Part 2 - Chapter VII


        What do you think about the funeral honors rendered to your
remains?
        “They were quite ordinary; I was a queen and not everybody
knelt before me ... Leave me alone ... I’m being forced to speak ...
I do not want you to know what I am now ... I was a queen; be
aware of that.”
        3. We respect your royal position and we would ask you to please
respond for our instruction. Do you believe that your son will one day
recover the estate of his father?
        “Of course. My blood will reign; he is entitled to it.”
        Do you attach the same importance to your son’s reintegration as
when you were incarnate?
        “My blood cannot be mixed with that of commoners.”
        4. The place of your birth could not be found on your death
certificate; could you now tell us what it was?
        “I was born into the noblest blood of India. I think I was
born in Delhi.”
        5. You used to live amidst the splendors of luxury and surrounded
with honors. What do you think about all that now?
        “I have the right to them.”
        Did the high position you occupied on earth enable you to enjoy
a higher position in the world where you are now?
        “I am still a queen ... Send slaves to serve me! ... I do not
know: no one seems to be very concerned about me here ... and
yet, I am still the same...”
        6. Did you belong to the Muslim religion or to a Hindu religion?
        “Muslim. However, I was too powerful to concern myself
with God.”
        What difference do you see between the religion you professed
and Christianity with regard to human happiness?
        “The Christian religion is absurd; it says that all people are
brothers.”

       What is your opinion of Muhammad?
       “He was not the son of a king.”
       Do you believe that he was on a divine mission?
       “What do I care!”
       What is your opinion about Christ?
       “The son of a carpenter is not worthy of occupying my thoughts.”
       7. What do you think about the custom where Muslim women
are withdrawn from the eyes of men?
       “I think that women were born to rule: I was a woman.”
       Have you ever envied the freedom enjoyed by European women?
       “No. What do I care about their freedom! Are those who
serve them on their knees?”
       8. Do you remember having any other existence on earth
previous to your last one?
       “I must have always been a queen.”
       9. Why did you answer our call so quickly?
       “I did not want to; I was forced ... Do you think I would
have condescended to answer? Who are you in comparison to me?”
       Who forced you to come?
       “I do not know ... however, there could not be anyone more
powerful than I.”
       10. In what form are you presenting yourself to us?
       “I continue as a queen ... Do you think I would cease being
so? ... You show little respect ... You must know that queens are
addressed differently.”
       11. If we could actually see you, would we see you in all your
arrays and jewels?
       “Certainly!”
       How does it happen that, having left all that behind, your spirit
retained such appearances, especially your finery?
       “They did not leave me ... I am as beautiful as ever ... I do not
know what idea you have of me! It is true that you have never seen me.”

      12. How do you feel about finding yourself amongst us?
      “If possible, I would not be ... You treat me with so little
respect!”
      St. Louis: Leave her alone, the poor creature. Have
compassion on her blindness; may she serve you as an example.
You do not realize how much her pride suffers.
      In evoking this now-entombed fallen grandeur, we did not
expect answers of great depth, given the education of most women
in that country; however, we thought that we might encounter
in this spirit, if not philosophy, at least a closer sense of reality
and more rational ideas related to vanity and earthly grandeur. Far
from it. In this spirit, earthy ideas have retained all their strength;
we see a pride which has lost none of its illusions, which struggles
against its own weakness, and which, in effect, must suffer much
from its powerlessness....

                            Xumene
                        (Bordeaux, 1862)

       A spirit used this name in presenting itself spontaneously to
the medium, who was accustomed to this type of manifestation
because her mission seemed to entail assisting low-order spirits
brought to her by her spirit guide with the two-fold objective of
aiding her instruction and their advancement.
       Who are you? Is this a woman’s name or a man’s?
       “A man’s – a man who is as unhappy as can be. I am suffering
all the torments of hell.”
       But if there is no hell, how can you suffer its torments?
       “A pointless question.”
       I understand, but others might need an explanation.
       “That doesn’t concern me.”

                                Hardened Spirits


       Mightn’t selfishness be one of the causes of your suffering?
       “Maybe.”
       If you desire relief, you might start by repudiating your bad inclinations.
       “Don’t worry about it; it’s none of your business. Start by
praying for me as you do for the others, and then we shall see.”
       If you don’t help me out by repenting, prayer will have little effect.
       “If you talk instead of praying, you won’t help me advance
very much.”
       So do you really want to evolve?
       “Maybe; I don’t know. Let’s see if prayer relieves my suffering;
that’s the essential thing.”
       Then join with me in the strong desire of obtaining your relief.
       “Go ahead.”
       (After the medium’s prayer) Do you feel satisfied?
       “Not like I had wanted.”
       Medicine administered for the first time can’t immediately cure
a long-standing malady.
       “Perhaps not.”
       Would you like to come back?
       “Yes, if you call me.”
       The medium’s Guide: Daughter, you will have much work
ahead of you with this hardened spirit, but there would hardly
be any merit in saving those who are not lost. Courage! Persevere
and you will succeed. No one is so guilty that he cannot be
amended by means of persuasion and example, since even the
most perverse spirits end up amending themselves with time.
Even if one does not succeed immediately in leading them back
to good sentiments – which is often impossible – one’s efforts
will not be lost. The thoughts one kindles in them stir them up
and make them reflect despite themselves. These are the seeds

       What I am telling you, my daughter, also applies to
incarnates, and you must understand why Spiritism, even among
firm believers, does not make perfect human beings immediately.
Belief is the first step; faith comes next and transformation will
have its turn. But for many it will be necessary to go to the spirit
world to renew themselves.
       Among the hardened spirits, there are not only wicked
and evil ones; there is a large number who, without trying to
be evil, remain stationary out of pride, indifference or apathy.
They are unhappy nonetheless, in that they suffer all the more
from their inertia because they don’t have worldly distractions as
compensation. The perspective of the infinite makes their situation
intolerable to them, and yet they have neither the strength nor the
will to exit the situation. They are those individuals who, while
incarnate, lead idle existences useless both to themselves and to
others, and who often end up by committing suicide with no
serious reason other than disgust with life.
       In general, these spirits are more difficult to lead back to
the good than those who are downright evil, since the latter have
energy. Once enlightened, they are as fervent for the good as they
were for evil. For the former, many incarnations are needed to
evolve appreciably. However, little by little, defeated by boredom
- like the latter by suffering - they begin to seek a distraction in
any sort of occupation whatsoever, which later on will become a
necessity to them.

           Marcel – The Child in No. 4
      In a provincial sanatorium, there was a boy of
approximately 8 to 10 years old, whose condition was difficult
to describe. He was designated as “No. 4”. He was completely
contorted, whether as the result of a congenital deformity or as
the result of the disease itself. His twisted legs touched his neck
and he was so gaunt that his bones were about to tear through
his skin. His body was covered with sores and his suffering was
atrocious. He belonged to a poor Jewish family, and his sad
condition had lasted four years. He was remarkably intelligent
for his age; his sweetness, his patience and his resignation were
uplifting. The physician under whose care he had been placed
was touched by compassion for the poor, nearly-abandoned
child – his parents seldom seemed to come to visit him – and
took a special interest in him. He enjoyed chatting with him,
charmed by his intellectual precociousness. Not only did he
treat him kindly, but when his duties would permit, he read to
him and marveled at his rectitude of judgment on matters that
seemed beyond his age.
      One day the boy said to the physician, “Doctor, please
be so kind as to give me some more of the same pills as the
last ones.” “But why, my child?” replied the physician, “I’ve

                               401

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


given you enough already and I’m afraid a bigger dose might be
harmful.” “Well, it’s just that I’m suffering so much. I’ve been
trying not to cry, and I’ve prayed to God to give me strength
not to disturb the other patients, but it’s been hard not to.
Those pills make me sleep, and when I’m asleep at least I don’t
disturb anyone.”
       These words are enough to demonstrate the elevation of
this soul enclosed within a malformed body. Where could this
poor creature have gotten such sentiments? Certainly not within
the environment in which he had been raised. Moreover, he
could not yet have possessed such an ability to reason at the age
at which he had begun to suffer. These sentiments were thus
inborn. However, if he was possessed of such noble instincts, and
if we were to accept the fact that his soul was created at the same
time as his body – the instrument of such cruel torture – why
had he been condemned by God to such a miserable and painful
life? Yes, one would either have to deny the goodness of God or
accept an anterior cause, that is, the preexistence of the soul and
the plurality of existences. The child is dead now and his last
thoughts were about God and about the caring doctor who had
taken pity on him.
       After some time, his spirit was evoked at the Parisian Society,
where he provided the following communication (1863):
       “You called me, and in order to touch all hearts, I have come
to make my voice heard beyond this wall. May the vibrations of its
echo reach people in their loneliness and remind them that agony
on earth prepares them for the joys of heaven; that suffering is
nothing more than the peel of a delectable fruit that yields courage
and resignation. That voice will tell them that, upon the invalid’s
pallet of misery lie those sent by the Lord; their mission consists in
teaching humankind that there is no pain that is insuperable with
the help of the Omnipotent and the good spirits. That voice will
enable them to hear groaning mixed with prayer and to understand

                                 402

                                      Earthly Expiations


the pious harmony that is much different than the guilty tones of
groaning mixed with blasphemy.
       “One of your good spirits, a great apostle of Spiritism, has
granted me his place tonight.76 I would like to take my turn to say
something about the progress of your Doctrine, which will aid the
mission of those who incarnate amongst you in order to learn how
to suffer. Spiritism will be the signpost; they will have its example
and voice to follow; groaning will then be turned into cries of
contentment and tears of joy.”
       From what you have said, it seems that your suffering was not
an expiation of previous wrongs.
       “My suffering was not actually a direct expiation, but I
can assure you that all suffering has a just cause. The one whom
you knew as being so miserable had once been handsome,
great, rich and admired. I had flatterers and courtesans; I was
vain and proud. I had once been truly guilty; I denied God and
harmed my fellow beings, but I cruelly expiated my wrongs
thereafter, first in the spirit world and then on the earth. The
suffering I endured for only a few years during my last and
short existence I bore for an entire lifetime into extreme old age
in the existence before it. Through repentance, I re-entered the
grace of the Lord, who entrusted me with several missions, the
last one of which you are familiar with. I myself had asked for
them in order to achieve my purification.
       “Goodbye, my friends. I will return to you a few more times.
My mission is to console, not to instruct. Nonetheless, there are so
many here whose wounds lie hidden that they will be happy with
my presence.”

           Instructions by the Medium’s Guide

       Poor weak, ulcerated, and deformed little sufferer! How
many cries of anguish he uttered in that asylum of misery and
tears! And despite his tender age, how resigned he was, and how
much his soul comprehended the purpose of suffering! He felt
that the reward for so many stifled groans awaited him beyond the
grave! Also, how he prayed for those who didn’t have the courage
to bear their maladies as he had, and especially for those who cast
blasphemies at heaven instead of prayers!
       Although his agony had been long and drawn out, his
moment of death was not dreadful. Of course, his convulsed limbs
contorted, displaying to those watching over him a deformed
body revolting against death – the law of the flesh that wants to
live in spite of itself. But an angel hovered over his deathbed and
healed his heart. Afterward, that angel bore in its white wings
that beautiful soul, which freed itself from its deformed body,
uttering these words: “Glory to you, my God!” And that soul,
ascending toward the Almighty, exclaimed: “Here am I, Lord;
you gave me the mission of learning how to suffer. Have I borne
the trial worthily?”
       And now the spirit of that poor child has resumed its true
proportions. It hovers in space, going to the weak and humble,
saying to all: “Have hope and courage.” Freed from all matter and
all impurities, he is next to you; he speaks to you in a voice that
is no longer suffering and mournful, but virile. He says to you:
“Those who beheld me saw a child who did not complain. They
have drawn a balm for their ills from my example, and their hearts
have been strengthened with sweet trust in God. Such was the
purpose of my short passage on the earth.”

                                 Szymel Slizgol
      Szymel Slizgol was a poor Jew from Vilna77, who died in
May of 1865. For 30 years he begged with a small bowl in his
hands. Everywhere in town, his call was familiar: “Remember the
poor, the widows and the orphans!” Over that time, he collected
90,000 rubles, but he did not keep one single kopeck for himself.
He relieved the sick – he himself looked after them; he paid for the
education of poor children and distributed the food he was given
to the needy. At night, the beggar spent his time preparing snuff,
which he sold in order to provide for his own needs. Anything left
over belonged to the poor. Szymel had been alone in the world, but
on the day of his burial a large part of Vilna’s population followed
his funeral procession, and all the shops closed their doors.

        Evocation: I have been here in your midst since the
beginning of this meeting, extremely happy at having finally
reached my goal, for which I paid a great price. I thank you for
your interest in the spirit of a poor beggar; I will happily try to
respond to your questions.
        A letter from Vilna filled us in on the most remarkable
particularities of your life, and the sympathy they have inspired in us
awakened our desire to communicate with you. We are grateful that
you have answered our call, and since you wish to respond to us, we
would be happy to know – for our instruction – your situation as a
spirit, as well as the causes that determined the kind of life you led
during your latest existence.

       “First of all, please grant to my spirit – which comprehends
its true position – the favor of transmitting its opinion regarding
a thought that has occurred to you regarding who I was. Please
advise me if it is wrong.
       “It seems odd to you that the public displays were so
impressive in paying homage to the memory of a nobody, whom
charity enabled to attract such sympathy. I’m not referring to you,
dear teacher, or to you, dear medium, or to you, all true and sincere
Spiritists, but to persons who are indifferent toward belief. There
is nothing remarkable about what happened. The moral pressure
exerted upon humankind through practicing the good is such that
no matter how material one might be, one always bows before it;
the good is always respected; it is welcome despite the tendency
one may have toward evil.
       “And now for your questions, which I know are not asked
out of curiosity but simply formulated for the sake of general
instruction. Since I have the freedom to do so, I will tell you
as succinctly as possible about the causes that motivated and
determined my last existence.
       “Many centuries ago, I lived with the title of king, or at
least a sovereign prince. Within the sphere of my power - relatively
limited when compared to today’s states - I was nevertheless the
absolute lord of my vassals’ fate. I acted as a tyrant, or rather – let
us use the proper term – as a tormentor. Of an imperious character,
I was violent, avaricious and lustful, and from that fact you can
imagine the fate of the poor beings who lived under my laws. I
abused my power to oppress the weak, to tax all types of trades,
occupations, passions and pains for the service of my own passions.
I even imposed a tithe on what beggars made; no one could beg for
anything without me first taking the lion’s share of the alms that
human pity let drop into the pockets of poverty. There was even
more: so that the number of beggars would not decrease among

                          Earthly Expiations


my vassals, I forbade those unfortunate beings from sharing with
their friends, relatives, or kin any of the pittances that remained.
In other words, I was the most heartless in every way regarding
suffering and poverty.
       “I finally lost what you call ‘life’ in the midst of torment
and horrendous suffering; my death was an example of terror
for those who, like me - though on a smaller scale - shared my
outlook. As a spirit, I remained in the errant state for three and
a half centuries, and at the end of that time I finally understood
that the purpose of reincarnating was something completely
different than what my gross and obtuse senses had led me to
pursue in the previous one. In answer to my prayers, resignation
and remorse, I received permission to take upon myself the
physical task of enduring the same torments – and much more –
that I had inflicted. I obtained this permission and through my
free will God granted me the right to amplify my mental and
physical suffering. Thanks to the support of good spirits assisting
me, I persisted in my resolution to practice the good, and I thank
them, for they kept me from succumbing under the load I had
taken upon my shoulders.
       “I finally fulfilled an existence which, through self-denial
and charity, redeemed what the other had held in terms of cruelty
and injustice. Born to poor parents and orphaned early on, I
learned to be self-sufficient at an age when many would consider
one incapable of understanding. I lived alone, without love and
without affection, and from the very start of my life I bore the
brutalities that I had inflicted on others. They say that all the sums
I collected were entirely consecrated to relieving my fellow beings:
that is a fact, to which, without pride or affectation, I might add
that so many times at the sacrifice of relatively hard – very hard –
privations, I increased the benefit that enabled me to perform
public charity.

       “I died in peace, trusting in the merit that the reparation
of my latest existence earned me, and I have been rewarded far
beyond my secret aspirations. Today, I am happy, absolutely happy
at being able to tell you that all those who exalt themselves shall be
humbled, and all who humble themselves shall be exalted.”
       Please be so kind as to tell us what your expiation consisted of
in the spirit world and how long it lasted from the moment of your
death until your fate was attenuated as a result of your repentance and
good resolutions. Also tell us what brought about the change in your
thoughts in the spirit state.
       “That question awakens many painful memories! How I
suffered ... but I don’t regret: I remember! ... You want to know
about the nature of my expiation. Then here it is in all its horror.
       “As I have told you, I had been the tormentor of all sorts
of good sentiments, and I remained for a long time – quite a
long time – linked by my perispirit to my rotting corpse. Until it
had decayed completely, I felt myself devoured by worms, which
made me suffer terribly! When I found myself free of the fetters
that had kept me prisoner to the instrument of my torture, I had
to endure an even crueler torment. After my physical suffering
came mental suffering, which was even more long-lasting than
the former. I was put in the presence of all the victims I had
afflicted. Periodically, a power superior to mine led me to face
my guilty actions. I physically and mentally saw all the pain
that I had made others endure. Ah! My friends, how terrifying is
the constant sight of those to whom we did evil! Amongst you,
you have only a faint example in the confrontation between the
accused and his victim.
       “That is a summary of what I suffered for two and a half
centuries, until God, touched by my pain and repentance, and
having been asked by the spirit guides who watched over me,
allowed me the life of expiation that you are familiar with.”

       Was there some particular reason that induced you to choose the
Jewish religion during your latest life?
       “I didn’t choose it, but heeded the counsel of my guides. The
Jewish religion added a small humiliation to my life of expiation,
since in certain countries most incarnates despised Jews, especially
Jewish beggars.”
       In your latest existence, at what age did you begin fulfilling the
resolutions you had made? How did the thought occur to you? While
you were practicing charity in such a self-denying manner, did you
have any intuition of the causes that had led you to do so?
       “I was born from poor but intelligent and greedy parents.
I was deprived of my mother’s affection and tenderness at a
young age. I experienced stronger grief upon her loss than did
my father, who, dominated by greed, completely abandoned me.
As for my brothers and sisters, they were all older than I and
didn’t seem to be concerned about my suffering. Another Jew,
moved more out of self-interest than charity, took me into his
home and taught me how to work. By using the product of my
work – which often exceeded my strength – he made up for most
of the expense I might have cost him otherwise. Later, I broke
free of his yoke and worked for myself. But everywhere, both in
work and in repose, the remembrance of my mother’s tenderness
followed me, and as I began to advance in years, her memory
became more deeply engraved on mine, and I mourned even
more for her solicitude and love.
       “It wasn’t long before I was left alone; within a few months,
death had reaped all my family. It was at that time that the way in
which I would spend the rest of my existence began to manifest.
Two of my brothers had left orphans behind, and moved by the
remembrance of what I myself had suffered, I wanted to save
those poor little beings from a childhood similar to mine. Since
my job was not enough to provide for the subsistence of them


                                  409

all, I began to beg for alms, not for myself but for them. God was
not to allow me the consolation of enjoying my efforts, for my
poor little nieces and nephews also left me for good. I knew good
and well what they lacked – their mother. Therefore, I decided
to beg for the unfortunate widows, who, not being able to work
both for themselves and their children, endured deprivations
that led them to their grave, thus leaving behind poor orphans,
abandoned and condemned to the same torments that I myself
had had to bear.
        “I was a very strong and healthy 30 years old when I turned
to begging for widows and orphans. The first steps were very
difficult, and I had to bear more than one humiliating word.
However, when it was seen that I really was distributing all that I
received on behalf of the poor, when it became known that I added
to it the surplus of my work earnings, I then acquired a certain
regard that was not without its charm.
        “I lived for 60 plus years and I never failed at the tasks that I
had imposed upon myself, nor had I ever received notice from my
conscience that would lead me to deduce that a motive previous
to my current existence was the reason for what I was doing. But
one day as I was about to go out again to beg, I heard these words:
‘Do not do unto others what you would not want them to do unto
you.’ I was struck by the general principles of morality contained
in those few words and surprised myself by adding these: ‘Instead,
do what you would want them to do unto you.’ Helped by the
memories of my mother and my own suffering, I thus continued
to tread a path that my conscience told me was a good one.
        “I shall finish this lengthy communication by saying,
‘Thank you’!
        “I am not still perfect, but knowing that evil only leads to
evil, I shall do good – as I already have – in order to reap happiness.”

             Julienne-Marie, the Beggar
       In the commune at Vilate, close to Nozai (Loire-Inferieure),
there was a poor woman named Julienne-Marie, who was old, in
poor health and living on public charity. One day, she fell into a
pond, and was pulled out by a fellow citizen, A..., who had helped
her on a regular basis. He took her home, where she died shortly
thereafter as a result of the accident. The rumor was that she had
meant to commit suicide. On the same day as her death, the man
who had rescued her, and who was both a Spiritist and a medium,
had the physical sensation that someone had brushed against him,
but he was not able to explain the cause. When he learned about
Julienne-Marie’s death, the thought occurred to him that her spirit
might have come to visit him.
       At the suggestion of one of his friends, a member of the
Parisian Society, and to whom he had related the incident,
he evoked the woman with the purpose of being useful to her.
However, he sought advice beforehand from his protector guides
and they gave him the following answer:
       “You may indeed evoke her. It will please her, although the
service you intend to provide her will be needless; she is happy
and completely devoted to those who used to show compassion
to her. You are one of her good friends; she hardly ever leaves
your side and has conversed many times with you without your
having been aware of it. Sooner or later, services – if not done
out of obligation – are rewarded by those who were concerned
with the person both before and after his or her death. In case
the spirit who benefits has not yet had time to realize its new
situation, other spirits who are sympathetic will come to express
its gratitude. That explains the sensation you felt on the day
Julienne-Marie passed away. Now, it is she who will help you in
the practice of the good you want to do. Remember what Jesus


                                411

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


said: ‘He who humbles himself shall be exalted.’ You will enjoy
the extent of service that this spirit will be able to render you
only if you ask her to help you to be useful to your neighbor.”
       Evocation: Kind Julienne-Marie, you are happy and that is all
I need to know, but it will not keep me from remembering you often
and from ever forgetting you in my prayers.
       “Trust in God; seek to inspire your patients with sincere
faith, and you will almost always succeed. Never be concerned
about the reward you will receive; it will be more than what you
had hoped for. God will always recompense those who deserve it,
those who dedicate themselves to relieving their brothers and who
bring a complete disinterestedness to their actions; any other way
and everything is just and illusion, a chimera. Faith is necessary
above all; otherwise, nothing is achieved. Remember this maxim
and you will marvel at the results you obtain. The two patients
whom you healed are proof of that; under the circumstances, you
would have failed with medicine alone.
       “Whenever you ask God to allow the good spirits to pour
their beneficial fluids over you and the request does not make
you feel an involuntary shudder, it is because your prayer was not
sufficiently fervent to be heard. Your prayer will only have been
answered if you feel the shudder. It was what you felt when you
said from the bottom of your heart: ‘Almighty God, merciful God,
God of infinite goodness, answer my prayer and allow the good
spirits to assist me in the healing of .... Take pity on him, my Lord,
and restore him to health, for without you I can do nothing. May
your will be done.’
       “You have done well in not despising the humble; the voices
of those who have resigned themselves to suffering and bearing
the miseries of this world are always heard and, as you have seen, a
service rendered always receives its recompense.
       “Now, a word about me that will confirm what I have just said.

                          Earthly Expiations


       Spiritism explains to you my language as a spirit: I have no
need to go into detail about the matter. I also deem it needless
to reveal my previous existence to you. The situation in which
you knew me on this earth will enable you to understand and
determine my previous existences, which were not always without
reproach. Condemned to an existence of misery, sick and unable
to work, I begged my entire life. I hadn’t hoarded money and in
my old age my small savings were limited to a hundred francs,
which I had saved for when my legs would not be able to carry
me any longer. However, God deemed my expiation and trial
sufficient and brought it to an end, freeing me, without suffering,
from earthly life; I didn’t commit suicide as people thought at first.
I died suddenly at the edge of the pond at the moment when I
addressed my last prayer to God. The slope of the land caused my
body to slide into the water.
       “I didn’t suffer at all, and I am happy that I was able to
resignedly complete my mission without impediment. I made
myself useful to the best of my abilities and means, and avoided
harming my fellow beings. Now, I have received my reward and I
give thanks to God, our Divine Master, who mitigates the bitterness
of our trials by enabling us to forget our previous existences while
we are alive, and who puts caring souls on our path to help us
endure the burden of our previous wrongs.
       “You too, persevere, and like me you shall be recompensed.
I thank you for all your good prayers and the service you rendered
me. I shall never forget them. We shall meet again someday and
many things shall be explained to you; for the time being, such
would be superfluous. You can only be sure that I am entirely
devoted to you and that I will always be at your side whenever you
need me to relieve those who suffer.”
       The good beggar woman,

       Julienne-Marie’s spirit was evoked at the Parisian Society on
June 10, 1864, and dictated the following message:
       “Thank you for admitting me into your midst, dear
president. You have well perceived that my previous existences
had been higher in terms of social standing; if I returned to
earth to endure the trial of poverty, it was to punish me for
my vain pride, which made me reject the poor and miserable.
Thus, I bore the just law of talion78, which rendered me the
most dreadful beggar in the country. But so that I might attest
to God’s goodness, I was not rejected by everybody, as I had
feared I would be. I also bore my trial without complaining,
foreseeing a better life from which I would not have to return
to this world of exile and calamity.
       “How fortunate the day when our soul, still young, can
return to the spirit life to see beloved beings once again! For I also
have loved and am happy to have found those who preceded me.
I give thanks to A..., who has opened the door of gratitude to me.
Without his mediumship, I wouldn’t have been able to thank and
show him that my soul has not forgotten the happy influence of
his kind heart, and to recommend that he endeavor to disseminate
his divine belief. He has been called to retrieve wayward souls and
he can be sure of my support. Yes, I can repay him a hundredfold
what he did for me by instructing him on the pathway that you
all have chosen. Give thanks to the Lord for allowing the Spirits
to give you instructions in order to encourage the poor in their
misery and to restrain the rich in their pride. Understand the
shame in rejecting the unfortunate. May I serve you as an example
so that you may avoid returning to the earth like I did to expiate

     Latin lex talionis principle developed in early Babylonian law and present in both
     biblical and early Roman law that criminals should receive as punishment precisely those
     injuries and damages they had inflicted upon their victims. Many early societies applied
     this “eye-for-an-eye” principle literally (talion. (2007). In Encyclopædia Britannica. From

your wrongs through those painful social positions that place you
so low, rendering you an outcast of society.”
                                                 Julienne-Marie

        The above communication was transmitted to A., who then
received the following one, which is a further confirmation:
        Good Julienne-Marie, since you desire to help me with your
good counsels so that I may progress on the path of our blessed
Doctrine, please communicate with me. I will make every effort to
take advantage of your instructions.
        “Remember the recommendation I am going to make
and never stray from it. Always be charitable to the best of your
ability; you already understand that charity must be practiced in
all circumstances of earthly life. Thus, I have no need to teach
you anything concerning the matter; you yourself will be the best
judge if you always follow the voice of your conscience, which will
never deceive you if you honestly listen to it.
        “Do not be mistaken about the missions you are supposed to
fulfill: great and small, everyone has their mission. Mine was very
trying, but I deserved such punishment because of my preceding
lifetimes, as I have come to confess to the good president of the
Parisian mater Society, to which will someday rally. That day is not
as far off as you might think, for Spiritism is taking great strides
despite all that is being done to hinder it. So, press on fearlessly,
fervent followers of the Doctrine, and your efforts will be crowned
with success. Who cares what someone might say about you! Set
yourselves above the ludicrous criticism that will rebound upon
Spiritism’s adversaries.
        “The Proud! They deem themselves powerful; they think
they can destroy you; you, my good friends, rest assured and do
not be afraid to stand up to them, for they are easier to win over
than you might suppose. Many among them fear and dread the

fact that the truth has finally come before their dazzled eyes. Wait
and they will come in their turn to help the crowning of the edifice.
                                                    Julienne-Marie

       Here is an account replete with teachings for whomever
meditates on this spirit’s words; all the great principles of Spiritism
are combined in them. Ever since her first communication, this
spirit has shown her moral ascendancy by her language; like
a beneficent fairy, this woman, now radiant as if completely
metamorphosed, has come to watch over the one who did not
despise her in her rags of poverty. This is an application of these
evangelical maxims: “The great shall be abased and the small shall
be exalted; blessed are the humble and afflicted, for they shall be
consoled; do not despise the small, for the one who is small in this
world may be much greater than you think....”

                      Max, the Beggar
       In a Bavarian village around the year 1850, an old man
known as father Max died at nearly 100 years old. No one really
knew where he came from, for he had no family. For around a half
century, stricken by infirmities that rendered him unable to earn
a living, he had no other resources but public charity, which he
disguised by selling almanacs and other trinkets among the farm
houses and castles. He was given the nickname “Count Max”, and
children addressed him only by that title, which made him smile
without taking offense. Why this title? No one knew, but custom
had sanctioned it. Perhaps it was on account of his physiognomy
and manners, whose refinement contrasted with his rags. Many
years after his death, Max appeared in a dream to the daughter
of the owner of one of the castles, where he had been allowed to
lodge in the stable, for he had no place of residence. He said to

                                 416

                          Earthly Expiations


her, “Thank you for your having remembered poor Max in your
prayers, for the Lord has heard them. You are a charitable soul
who has taken an interest in an unfortunate beggar and you would
like to know who I was; I will satisfy your wish. It will be of great
instruction to all.”
       Then he gave the following account in roughly these terms:
       “About a century and a half ago, I was the rich and powerful
lord of this region, but I was vain, proud and infatuated with my
nobility. I never used my huge fortune for anything but to satisfy
my pleasures. My fortune was barely enough, for I was a gambler
and a debauchee, and spent my life in orgies. My vassals, whom
I deemed worthy of being used like farm animals, were exploited
and mistreated to provide for my extravagances. I remained deaf to
their complaints, as was the case with all the misfortunate beings
who, in my opinion, ought to consider themselves very honored
at satisfying my whims. I died at a young age, exhausted by my
excesses but without having truly experienced any real misfortune;
on the contrary, everything seemed to smile on me to such a degree
that I passed as one of the most favored beings on earth. My social
position entitled me to a lavish funeral; the bons vivants mourned
the loss of an extravagant lord, but not a tear was shed at my tomb,
nor a heartfelt prayer said to God on my behalf, and my memory
was cursed by all those whose misery I had contributed to. Ah!
How terrible is the curse of the misfortunate beings whom one has
harmed! That curse never ceased ringing in my ears throughout the
long years that seemed like an eternity! And after the death of each
one of my victims, there was a new threatening or sarcastic face
appearing before me to hound me without respite, and without
my being able to find a dark corner in which to hide from its sight!
Not one friendly glance! My old companions in debauchery – as
unhappy as I – fled from me and seemed to say in scorn, ‘You can
no longer pay for our pleasures.’ Oh! What I would have paid for a


                                 417

                          Part 2 - Chapter VIII


moment of repose, for a glass of water to quench the burning thirst
that devoured me! But I did not possess anything anymore, and
all the gold that I had scattered by the handfuls upon the earth didn’t
produce one single blessing, not one, you see, my child!
        “Finally, overcome by fatigue, exhausted like a weary traveler
who cannot foresee the end of his journey, I cried, ‘My God, have
mercy on me! When will this excruciating situation end?’ Then a
voice – the first that I heard after having left the earth – said to me,
‘When you will it.’ ‘What must I do, great God?’ I replied. ‘Please
tell me; I will submit myself to anything.’ ‘You must repent; you
must humble yourself before those whom you humiliated; ask them
to intercede for you, for the prayer of the offended who forgive is
always pleasing to the Lord.’ So I humbled myself, and I begged
for the forgiveness of my vassals and my servants. They appeared
before me, their faces little by little becoming more kindly and
finally disappearing altogether. It was as if I had been granted
new life. Desperation gave way to hope as I thanked God with
all the strength of my soul. The voice added, ‘Prince!’ to which I
responded, ‘There is no other prince here but the almighty God,
who humbles the haughty. Forgive me Lord, for I have sinned, and
if it be your will, make me the servant of my servants.’
        “A few years later, I was born once more, but this time into
a family of poor villagers. My parents died while I was still a child,
and I was alone and without help in the world. I made a living
however I could, sometimes as a farmhand or sometimes as a
workman, but always honestly because I believed in God this time.
At the age of forty, an illness rendered me completely crippled and
I had to beg for more than fifty years in the same lands over which
I had been absolute lord. I was happy to receive a morsel of bread
on the farms that I once possessed and where, by bitter irony, I had
been given the nickname of Count Max. I was very fortunate to
often find shelter in the stable of the very castle that had once been


                                  418

                         Earthly Expiations


mine. While I slept, I took pleasure in roaming that same castle
where I had reigned as a despot. How many times in my dreams
I saw myself amidst my old fortune! Upon waking, such visions
left me with an undefined feeling of bitterness and sadness, but
not one complaint ever escaped my lips. And when it pleased God
to call me to him, I praised him for having given me the courage
to undergo without complaint such a long and painful trial, for
which today I have received my reward. As for you, my child, I
bless you for having prayed for me.”
       We recommend this example to all those who claim humans
would have no restraint if they did not have before them the
scarecrow of eternal punishment, and we would ask them if the
prospect of a punishment like that of Count Max would have
less weight to stop those on the path of evil than that of endless
torture, which no one believes in anymore.

                The Story of a Servant
       In a family of the upper nobility, there was a young servant
whose intelligent and fine features surprised us with their air of
distinction. One could detect nothing base about him from that
aspect. His eagerness to serve his masters displayed none of the
servility common to those in his position. When we returned to
visit this family the following year, the young man was nowhere to
be seen and we asked if he had been dismissed. No, we were told,
he had gone to spend a few days in his hometown and had passed
away while there. We mourned his loss a great deal, for he had
been an excellent young man possessed of sentiments well above
his position. He was very attached to us and had given us proof of
great devotion.
       Later, we got the idea to evoke the young man and this is
what he told us:

                                419

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


        “During my next-to-last incarnation, I was from an
upstanding family – as they say on earth. However my father
squandered our assets in his extravagance. I was orphaned while
very young and had no resources. A friend of my father took me
in and raised me as his son, providing me with a good education,
from which I derived a little too much vanity. That friend is
today Mr. G., in whose service you had seen me during my last
life. I wanted to expiate my pride by being born into a servile
position, and where I would have the chance to demonstrate
my dedication to my benefactor. I even saved his life without
his ever having known about it. It was at the time a trial from
which I emerged victorious since I had enough strength not to
allow myself become corrupted by contact with an almost always
corrupting environment. Despite bad examples, I remained pure
and I give thanks to God, for I have been rewarded with the
happiness that I now enjoy.”
        Under what circumstances did you save Mr. G.’s life?
        “I was following behind him while we were riding horses,
when I saw a large tree just ahead starting to fall over, but he did
not see it. I called to him by shouting with all my might. He turned
aside quickly and the tree fell at his feet; without the movement I
had caused, he would have been crushed.”
        When we mentioned this incident to Mr. G., he remembered
it perfectly well.
        Why did you die so young?
        “God deemed my trial to have been sufficient.”
        How could you have profited from such a trial if you had no
remembrance of the cause that motivated it?
        “In my humble condition, I still retained an intuition of my
former pride. I am quite happy at having been able to control it, a
fact that made the trial profitable to me; otherwise, I would have to
go through it all over again. During its moments of freedom, my


                                 420

                           Earthly Expiations


spirit remembered, and upon awakening it retained an intuitive
desire to resist the inclinations I felt to be evil. I earned more merit
struggling in this way than if I had clearly remembered my past
life. The memory of my former position would have exalted my
pride and would have given me trouble, whereas I only had to
combat the allurements of my new position.”
       What good was the brilliant education you had received
during your next-to-last incarnation since you did not remember the
knowledge you had acquired?
       “Such knowledge would have been useless, even nonsensical,
in my new position; it remained latent and I have now regained it.
Nonetheless, that knowledge was not completely useless, because
it helped my intelligence develop; I instinctively had a predilection
for elevated things, which inspired me with repugnance for the low
and ignoble examples I had before me. Without that education, I
would have been nothing more than a servant.”
       Are the examples of selfless devotion of servants toward their
masters the result of previous relationships?
       “Have no doubt about it, for such is usually the case.
Sometimes such servants even used to be members of the family,
or as in my case, duty-bound persons who pay a debt of gratitude
and whose dedication helps them to advance. You do not know
all the effects of sympathy or antipathy that these previous
relationships produce in the world. No, death does not interrupt
such relationships, which often last from century to century.”
       Why are such examples of dedication from servants so rare
nowadays?
       “Blame the selfish and prideful spirit of your time, aggravated
by incredulity and materialistic ideas. True faith departs when
faced with cupidity and the desire for material gain, and when
faith departs, so does devotion. By leading people to the truth,
Spiritism will revive forgotten virtues.”


                                  421

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


       There is nothing better than this example to demonstrate
the benefits of forgetting one’s former existences. If Mr. G. had
remembered who his servant had been formerly, he would have
felt very uncomfortable and would not have kept him in his
position; he would have hampered the trial that ended up being
advantageous to both of them.

                          Antonio B.
             Buried Alive – The law of Talion

       Antonio B. was a talented writer, esteemed by his fellow
citizens. He lived in Lombardia, and fulfill a civil servant position
with distinction and integrity. Around 1850 he fell victim to
a condition of apparent death as the result of an apoplectic
attack. As sometimes happens, it was unfortunately mistaken
for real death. It was easy to make such a mistake because signs
of decomposition were seemed obvious on the body. Fifteen
days after his burial, a fortuitous incident led the family to
request an exhumation. It so happened that a medallion had
been inadvertently left in the coffin. The assistants were terribly
shocked when, upon opening the coffin, they saw that the body
had changed position, that it had turned face downward and –
horrible thing! – that one of the hands had been partially gnawed
on by the deceased. It was obvious that the unfortunate Antonio
B. had been buried alive and that he must have succumbed to
desperation and hunger.
       Antonio B. was evoked in August of 1861 at the Parisian
Society at the request of one of his relatives, and gave the following
explanations:
       1. Evocation
       “What do you want?”

                                 422

                             Earthly Expiations


        2. One of your relatives has asked us to evoke you and we
are pleased to do so; we would appreciate it if you would answer us.
        “Yes, I will answer you.”
        3. Do you remember the circumstances of your death?
        “Ah! Of course, I remember. But why awaken that memory
of punishment?”
        4. Is it correct that you were buried alive by mistake?
        “That is the way it must have been, since apparent death displays
all the characteristics of real death; I had lost nearly all my blood. But
no one is to blame for an incident foreseen before my birth.
        5. If such questions are prone to cause you sadness, should we stop?
        “No, you may continue.”
        6. We would like to know if you are happy, for you left behind
the reputation of an honest man.
        “Thank you very much. I know that you have prayed for
me. I will try to answer, but if I fail, one of your Guides will help
me out.”
        7. Could you describe the sensations you experienced during
that horrible moment?
        “Oh! What a grievous trial! Feeling yourself confined between
four boards and not being able to turn around or move! Not being able
to scream, your voice no longer able to resound in an environment
deprived of air! Oh! What torture is that of a misfortunate being
who vainly struggles to breathe in an atmosphere depleted of air.
Alas! I was like someone condemned to a furnace, only without the
heat. Oh! I wish such tortures on no one. No, I wish on no one
an end like mine! Alas! Cruel punishment for a cruel and brutal
existence! Don’t ask me what I thought, but I plunged into the past
and caught a vague glimpse of the future.”
        8. You said: cruel punishment for a brutal existence. However,
your reputation, intact even today, would not lead anyone to assume
such a thing. Could you explain it to us?


                                    423

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


        “What is the duration of one lifetime in light of eternity?
Of course, I sought to act rightly during my latest incarnation,
but I had accepted such an epilogue before I re-entered humanity.
Ah! Why question me about the grievous past, which only I and
the good spirits sent by the Lord know about? Well, if you must
know, I walled up a woman – my wife – alive in a cellar! It is the
penalty of talion to which I had to submit: an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth.”
        9. We thank you for having been willing to answer our questions
and we pray for God to forgive your past because of the merit of your
latest existence.
        “I will return later; besides, the spirit of Erastus wishes to
complete this communication.”
        Instructions by the Medium’s Guide:
        “What you may infer from this communication is that all
your existences are interrelated and that none are independent of
any of the others; the concerns, the tribulations, as well as the great
sufferings that afflict humans, are always the consequences of a
previous criminal or ill-employed life. Nonetheless, I must tell you
that deaths such as Antonio B’s are rare and if that man’s blameless,
latest existence ended in such a death, it was because he himself
had asked for it with the aim of shortening his errant state and
more quickly reach the higher spheres. In fact, after a period of
trouble and mental suffering to further expiate his heinous crime,
he will be forgiven and will go to a better world where he will find
his victim, who awaits him and who already forgave him long ago.
Thus, learn well from this cruel example, my dear Spiritists, so
that you may patiently bear mental and physical suffering and all
of earth’s little miseries.”
        What advantage can humankind gain from such punishments?
        “Punishments do not occur in order to develop humankind,
but to punish the guilty individual. Frankly, humankind as a


                                 424

                           Earthly Expiations


whole has no interest in the suffering of one of its members. In
this case, the punishment fit the wrong. Why are there insane,
mentally impaired and paralytic individuals? Why do some die by
fire? Why do some suffer the tortures of a long agony, unable to
live or die? Ah! Believe me; respect the sovereign will and try not
to probe the reason behind the decrees of Providence! Know that
God is just and does only what is good.”
                                                           Erastus

        Doesn’t this example contain a great and awesome teaching?
Thus, God’s justice always reaches the guilty, and although it may
arrive late sometimes, it does not fail to follow its course nonetheless.
Isn’t it eminently moral to realize that if greatly guilty individuals
live their existence peacefully, and often in abundance of earthly
assets, their hour of expiation will nevertheless sound sooner or later?
Punishments of this nature are understandable, not only because we
can witness them somehow, but also because they are logical. We
believe in them because our reason accepts them.
        Thus, an honorable existence does not exclude the trials of
life, since one has chosen or accepted them as a supplement to
expiation; it is the remaining balance on a debt that we pay before
we receive the award for the progress we have accomplished.
        If we consider how frequent acts of barbarity were in days
gone by (but which shock us so much nowadays) even among
the highest and most enlightened classes, how many murders were
committed in those times when the lives of others were disregarded
and when the weak were unscrupulously crushed by the powerful,
then one will understand that among our contemporaries there
must be those who have cleansed their past. One will no longer
wonder at the considerable number of persons who succumb as
victims of isolated accidents or general catastrophes. The despotism,
fanaticism, ignorance and prejudices of the Middle Ages and


                                  425

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


of the times that followed bequeathed to future generations an
immense debt that has not yet been liquidated. Many examples of
misfortune seem to us to be undeserved solely because we can only
see the present.

                               Letil
       Mr. Letil, a manufacturer who lived on the outskirts of Paris,
died a horrible death in April of 1864. A vat of boiling varnish
caught fire and in the blink of an eye his body was covered with
flaming matter; he knew right away that he was lost. Alone with a
young apprentice in the shop at the time, he had enough strength
to reach his home, more than two hundred yards away. By the
time he could be given first aid, shreds of charred flesh were falling
off, and the bones on part of his body and face were exposed. He
survived for twelve hours in excruciating suffering; despite it all,
he kept his presence of mind up to the last moment and put his
affairs in order with perfect lucidity. Throughout the cruel agony,
no one heard him utter one single groan, one single murmur; he
died praying to God. He was a most honorable man of a gentle and
benevolent character, loved and cherished by all who knew him.
He had enthusiastically embraced Spiritist ideas, though without
much reflection; for this reason, and being somewhat of a medium
himself, he was the target of several deceptions; nevertheless, his
faith did not weaken as a result. In certain cases, his trust in what
spirits said to him verged on naiveté.
       Upon being evoked at the Parisian Society on April 29,
1864, a few days after his death and still under the influence of the
terrible scene of which he had been the victim, he provided the
following communication:
       “Profound sadness oppresses me! I am still aghast at my
tragic death and I feel like I am under the executioner’s axe.

                                 426

                          Earthly Expiations


How I suffered! Oh, how I suffered! I’m trembling all over. It
seems like I am can still smell the fetid odor that my burnt flesh
casts around me. An agony of 12 hours that you, O guilty spirit,
endured! It has suffered without complaining, and so God will
give it his forgiveness.
       “Oh! My dear wife! Do not cry over me any longer; my
pain will soon abate. I am no longer suffering physically, but the
remembrance is the same as the reality. My knowledge of Spiritism
is helping me a great deal, and I can now see that without such a
sweet belief I would have remained in the delirium into which I
was cast by that horrible death.
       “However, I have a consoling spirit who hasn’t left me
since I breathed my last. I was still able to speak, when I saw
him already at my side; I thought that a reflection of my pain
was making me delirious and causing me to see ghosts ... But
no, it was my guardian angel, who, silently and quietly, consoled
my heart. As soon as I left the earth behind, he said, ‘Come, my
son, greet the new day.’ Then I breathed more easily, believing I
had left a horrifying nightmare. I talked about my beloved wife,
that courageous child who had devoted herself to me. He said,
‘They are all on the earth, whereas you, my son, are with us.’ I
went looking for my house; my angel let me re-enter it in his
company. I saw everyone bathed in tears. Sadness and mourning
had invaded that once-peaceful dwelling. I couldn’t handle the
scene of such a painful spectacle any longer, and all emotional, I
said to my Guide, ‘Oh, my good angel, let’s get out of here!’ ‘Yes,
let us leave’, he responded, ‘and seek repose.’
       “Since then, I have suffered less, and if I didn’t see my wife
so inconsolable and my friends so sad, I would be almost happy.
       “My good guide, my dear angel, told me why I had
experienced such a terrible death, and for your instruction, my
children, I want to confess something to you:


                                 427

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


       “Two centuries ago, I ordered a young girl, as innocent as
one could be at that age – about 12 to 14 years – to be burned
at the stake. What was she accused of? Alas! For having been the
accomplice of a conspiracy against the policy of the clergy. At
the time, I was an Italian judge of the Inquisition. And since the
executioners didn’t dare touch the body of the poor child, I myself
was both judge and executioner. Oh, justice, God’s justice, how
great you are! I have yielded to you. I had promised so much not
to waver on the day of struggle that I had the strength to keep my
commitment. I did not complain and you have forgiven me, O my
God! But when will the remembrance of my poor innocent victim
be erased from my memory? Is it this which causes me to suffer?
She must forgive me too.
       “Oh, you children of the New Doctrine, you sometimes say:
we cannot remember what we did previously and that is why we
cannot avoid the evils to which we expose ourselves. It is due to
our forgetfulness of the past! Oh, my brothers! Praise God, for if
he were to allow you to have such remembrance, there would be
no respite for you while on earth. Constantly assailed by shame
and remorse, could you enjoy a moment of peace?
       “Forgetfulness is a blessing; remembrance here is a torture.
In just a few more days, and as recompense for the resignation with
which I bore my suffering, God shall grant me the forgetfulness
of my wrong. That is what my good angel has just promised me.”
       Mr. Letil’s character during his last incarnation demonstrates
how much his spirit had improved itself. His conduct was the result
of his repentance and the good resolutions he had made beforehand,
but that was not sufficient. He had to crown his resolutions with a
great act of expiation. He had to bear as a man the torture that he
had inflicted on another. In such a terrible circumstance, resignation
was for him the greatest trial, and fortunately, he did not fail it.
His understanding of Spiritism undoubtedly contributed greatly to

                           Earthly Expiations


sustaining his courage due to the sincere faith that it had given him
in the future: he knew that life’s sufferings are trials and expiations,
and he had resignedly submitted to them by saying, ‘God is just; I
have therefore deserved them.’

                  An Ambitious Scholar
       Mrs. B. from Bordeaux did not have to endure the poignant
anguish of poverty, but she was a martyr to physical suffering
due to a long string of serious illnesses of which she had been the
target for 70 years, from the time she was 5 months old. For nearly
every year of her life, they had brought her to the brink of death.
Three times she had been poisoned by the tests that a dubious
science conducted on her, and her constitution, ruined as much
by medications as by the illnesses themselves, rendered her prey
until the end of her days to intolerable suffering, which nothing
could relieve. Her daughter, a Christian Spiritist and medium,
asked God in her prayers to soften her mother’s cruel trials but
her spirit guide told her to simply ask for her to have the strength
to bear them with patience and resignation, and then dictated the
following instructions:
       “In human existence, everything has its reason for being:
there is not one single suffering that you have caused that does not
find an echo in the sufferings you endure; there is not one of your
privations that is not the result of your excesses; there is not
one tear that falls from your eyes that is not meant to cleanse a
wrong or sometimes a crime. Therefore, as cruel as they might
seem, patiently and resignedly bear physical and mental pain
and imagine the farmer whose limbs are broken with fatigue but
who nonetheless continues to work without stopping, because he
always has before him the golden ears of corn that will be the
result of his perseverance. This is the fate of the unfortunate beings

                                  429

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


who suffer in your world; the aspiration to happiness, which must
be the result of their patience, will render them resistant to the
ephemeral pains of humanity.
       “Thus it is for your mother. Each pain that she accepts as an
expiation corresponds to a blemish erased from her past, and the
sooner all the blemishes are erased, the sooner she will be happy.
Lack of resignation renders suffering sterile, for then the trials will
have to be recommenced. So, what is most useful for her is courage
and submission, and that is what you must pray for God and the
good spirits to grant her.
       “Your mother had been a good [male] physician in the past,
living amidst surroundings that made it easy to live well, and in
which he lacked no gifts or praise. Greedy for glory and riches, and
wanting to reach the pinnacle of his science, not with a view to
relieving his brothers – for he was no philanthropist – but with a
view to increasing his reputation and clientele, he didn’t hesitate
to do anything to reach his objectives. His mother was martyred
on her bed of suffering because he was attempting to do a study
on the convulsions which he himself caused; his son was subjected
to experiments which he hoped would give him the key to certain
phenomena; the elderly saw their lives being shortened and healthy
persons felt weakened by experiments meant to prove the effectiveness
of this or that potion. All these experiments were performed on
unsuspecting, unfortunate patients. The satisfaction of greed and
pride, the thirst for gold and fame, were the motives behind such
conduct. Many centuries and dreadful trials were needed to tame
this ambitious and pride-filled spirit, until repentance began its work
of regeneration. The reparation has come to an end, for the trials of
her last existence may even be regarded as mild compared to those
she bore in the past. Take heart, then, because if her punishment has
been long and cruel, the reward bestowed on her for her resignation,
patience and humility will be great.

      “Have courage, all you who suffer: consider the brevity
of material existence; think about the joys of eternity. Call
upon hope – that devoted friend of all suffering hearts; call
upon faith, its sister, which shows you the heaven where hope
allows you to enter beforehand. Also, call upon those friends
whom the Lord has provided you, who surround you, who
uphold and love you, and whose constant solicitude leads you
back to the One whom you have offended by transgressing
the Divine laws.”
      After her death, Mrs. B dictated communications – either to
her daughter or to the Parisian Spiritist Society – which reflected
the most eminent qualities and which confirmed what had been
said about her previous history.

    Charles de Saint-G., Mentally Impaired
              (Parisian Spiritist Society, 1860)

       Charles de Saint-G. was a mentally impaired 13-year-old
boy, who was still living, and whose intellectual faculties were
so impaired that he could not even recognize his own parents.
He could barely feed himself. He had experienced the complete
developmental suspension of his entire organic system.
       1. (To St. Louis) Would you tell us if we could evoke this
child’s spirit?
       “You can evoke him as if you were evoking the spirit of a
deceased person.”
       2. Your response would seem to imply that we may evoke him
at any time.
       “Yes, his soul is held to his body by physical ties, but not by
spiritual ones; it can free itself at any time.”
       3. (Evocation of Ch. de Saint-G.)

                           Part 2 - Chapter VIII


        “I am a poor spirit held to the earth like a bird tied down
by one leg.”
        4. In your present state as a spirit, are you aware of your complete
impairment in this world?
        “Of course, I feel my captivity very well.”
        5. While your body is sleeping and your spirit is free, do you
have thoughts as lucid as if you were in a normal state?
        “While my unfortunate body rests, I am a bit freer to reach
out toward the heaven to which I aspire.”
        6. While in the spirit state, do you experience any sensations of
pain as a result of your corporeal state?
        “Yes, since it is a punishment.”
        7. Can you remember your previous existence?
        “Oh, yes! It is the cause of my present exile.”
        8. What kind of existence was it?
        “That of a young libertine during the reign of Henri III.”
        9. You said that your present condition is a punishment; so you
didn’t choose it?
        “No.”
        10. In your current state of impairment, how can your present
life serve for your advancement?
        “It is not null before God, who imposed it on me.”
        11. Can you see how long your current existence will last?
        “No. But a few more years and I will re-enter my homeland.”
        12. What did you do as a spirit between your previous existence
and your present incarnation?
        “God imprisoned me because I was a thoughtless spirit.”
        13. In your waking state, are you aware of what goes on around
you despite the imperfection of your organs?
        “I can see and hear, but my body neither understands nor
perceives anything.”
        14. Could we do anything to help you?


                                    432

                          Earthly Expiations


       “Nothing.”
       15. (To St. Louis) Could the prayers we say for an incarnate
spirit have the same effectiveness as for an errant spirit?
       “Prayers are always good and are agreeable to God. In this
poor spirit’s case, they do not do him any good at present, but they
will serve him later. God will take them into account.”
       This evocation confirms what has always been said about
the mentally impaired. Their mental impairment does not
correspond to their spirit’s impairment; regardless of the physical
organs, the spirit enjoys all of its faculties. The imperfection
of the organs is only an obstacle to the free manifestation of
thought. Thus, it is like a hale and hearty man whose limbs
have been tied.

          A Spirit’s Teaching on the Mentally
         Impaired, Given at the Parisian Society

       Mentally impaired persons are being punished for having
used their powerful mental faculties badly; their soul is imprisoned
in a body whose incapacitated brain cannot express their thoughts.
This mental and physical muteness comprises one of the cruelest
earthly punishments possible, and is often chosen by repentant
spirits who want to redeem their wrongs. Such a trial is not
unfruitful, however, because the spirit does not remain idle while
in its prison of flesh. Its dazed eyes see and its weak brain thinks,
but it can express nothing either in words or gaze. Except for the
fact that they can move, these beings are in a mental state similar
to that of lethargic or cataleptic persons, who see and hear what
happens around them without being able to express it. When you
have a terrifying nightmare, during which you want to escape
from danger, to scream and cry out for help, but your tongue
remains stuck to your palate and your feet to the ground, you are


                                 433

                          Part 2 - Chapter VIII


experiencing for a moment what the mentally impaired experience
all the time: the paralysis of the body joined to the life of the spirit.
        Nearly all infirmities thus have their reason for being, for
nothing occurs without a cause, and what you might call an injustice
of fate is only an application of the highest justice. Insanity is also
a punishment for having abused superior faculties. The insane
individual has two personalities: the one that is delirious and the
one that is aware of its acts without being able to control them.
Regarding the mentally impaired, the contemplative and isolated
life of their soul (apart from the distractions of the body) can be as
much affected by events as the most complicated existences. Some
revolt against their voluntary punishment; they regret having
chosen it and experience a furious desire to return to the other life,
a desire that makes them forget resignation in the present life and
their remorse for their past life, which they are able to remember,
because the mentally impaired and the insane know more than
you might think. Behind their physical powerlessness a mental
power lies hidden, of which you have no idea. The acts of fury
or stupidity to which their body is compelled are judged by their
inner being, who suffers and is vexed by them. Thus, to mock,
injure or otherwise mistreat such individuals – as often happens –
is to increase their suffering, for it makes them feel more cruelly
their deficiency and abjection. If they could, they would accuse
those who act this way as being cowards, knowing that the victim
cannot defend him or herself.
        Insanity is not one of the divine laws and science may make
it disappear, since it is the physical result of ignorance, poverty
and filth. The modern hygienic resources that science, having
become more practical, has made available to everyone, tends to
destroy it. Since progress is an express condition of humankind,
the kinds of trials that are imposed will change along with the
march of time; they will become completely mental, and when


                                  434

                           Earthly Expiations


the earth – still young – will have fulfilled all the phases of its
current existence, it will become a dwelling of happiness like
other more advanced planets.
                                Pierre Jouty, the medium’s father

       There was a time when one would have had questions
regarding the soul of the mentally impaired, wondering if they truly
belonged to the human species at all. Isn’t the way that Spiritism
contemplates the facts highly moralizing and greatly instructive?
Doesn’t such a matter deserve our serious reflection considering
that such disgraced bodies contain souls who may have shined on
earth at one time, souls who are as lucid and thinking as our own
but enclosed in a dense envelope that stifles their expressions; that
the same thing could happen to us someday if we were to abuse the
faculties that Providence has granted us?
       How could mental impairment be explained otherwise?
How could we reconcile it with the justice and goodness of God
apart from accepting the plurality of existences? If the soul has not
lived before, then it must have been created at the same time as the
body, but in that case, how may we explain how a just and good
God could have created souls as wanting as those of the mentally
impaired? Here we are not dealing with one of those accidents, like
insanity, for example, which may be prevented or cured, but with
beings who are born and die in the same condition. Since they
have no notion of good or evil, what is their fate in the eternal life?
Might they be as happy as intelligent and hard-working individuals?
But why such favoritism if they have done nothing good? Will
they be in so-called limbo, that is, in a mixed state that is neither
happy nor unhappy? But then why such eternal inferiority? Is
it their fault that God has created them mentally impaired? We
challenge all those who deny the doctrine of reincarnation to break
this impasse. In contrast, by accepting reincarnation, what appears


                                  435

                                    Part 2 - Chapter VIII


to be an injustice becomes admirably just, and what seems to be
inexplicable is explained in a most rational manner.
       Moreover, we know that those who reject this Doctrine
have never opposed it with arguments other than their personal
repugnance at the idea of having to come back to earth. To that
we would respond: God does not ask your permission to send you
back to earth, in the same way that the judge does not consult the
defendant’s preferences before sending him or her to jail. Everyone
enjoys the possibility of not having to come back to earth by
improving themselves enough to merit going to a higher sphere.
However, selfishness and pride are not admitted on those happy
worlds; hence the need for all to rid themselves of these two moral
diseases through their own efforts, if they want to ascend.
       We know that in certain countries the mentally impaired
are far from being regarded as objects of scorn but instead are
surrounded by benevolent care. Mightn’t this sentiment indicate
an intuition about the true state of these unfortunate individuals
as being more worthy of consideration since their spirit,
understanding its condition, must suffer at seeing itself as the
outcast of society?79
       Families in these societies even view it as a favor and a
blessing to have one of these beings as a member. Is this a result
of superstition? Possibly, because among the ignorant, superstition
is often confused with the most sacred ideas, of which they are
unaware. Whatever the case may be for such family members, it is
an opportunity to practice charity, which is all the more meritorious
because they are often poor, and it is thus for them a responsibility
from which they derive no material compensation. There is greater
merit in surrounding an unfortunate child with affectionate care
than one whose qualities offer some sort of compensation. Selfless

charity is one of the virtues most pleasant to God and always
attracts divine blessings to those who practice it. To these, this
inborn sentiment is equivalent to this prayer: “Thank you, my
God, for having given us as a trial a fragile being to uphold, an
afflicted being to console.”

             Adelaide-Marguerite Gosse
       Adelaide-Marguerite was a poor, humble maid from
Normandy, near Harfleur. At 11 years of age she went to work
for some wealthy ranchers in her area. Some years later, the Seine
flooded and carried off and drowned all their animals! Other
misfortunes followed and the girl’s employers fell into poverty!
Adelaide identified with them in their misfortune, stifled the voice
of selfishness and, listening only to her generous heart, convinced
them to accept 500 francs she had saved up. She then continued to
work for them without pay. After her employers died, she devoted
herself to their daughter – a penniless widow. She toiled in the
fields and took her gain to the house. She got married and joined
her efforts with those of her husband in order to support the poor
woman, whom she still called ‘her mistress’! Her sublime self-
denial continued for nearly a half century.
       The Society of Emulation at Rouen did not forget this
woman, so worthy of respect and admiration, and awarded her an
honorary medal and some financial compensation. The Masonic
Lodges of Havre added to this tribute and awarded her a small
sum intended for her welfare. Finally, the town administration also
provided for her in a discreet way, sparing her any susceptibility.
       An attack of palsy took this beneficent being from the earth
suddenly and painlessly. The final respects paid to her memory
were simple yet decent. The Municipal Secretary led the funeral
procession.

           (Parisian Society, December 27, 1861)

       Evocation: We pray to Almighty God to allow the spirit of
Marguerite Gross to communicate with us.
       “Yes, God has kindly granted me such a grace.”
       We consider ourselves fortunate to be able to express our
admiration for your conduct during your earthly existence and we
hope that your self-denial has earned you your recompense.
       “Yes, God has been good and merciful toward this servant.
Everything I did, and which seems praiseworthy to you, was
completely natural.”
       For our instruction, could you tell us the cause behind your
humble condition while on earth?
       “For two successive existences I occupied a high-level position.
It was easy for me to practice the good without sacrifice because I
was rich. However, it seemed that I was evolving too slowly, and
that is why I asked to return in a more humble condition, in which
I would have to struggle with privation. I prepared myself for a
long time. God upheld my courage, and so I was able to reach my
intended goal, thanks to the spiritual assistance he gave me.”
       Have you seen your former employers? Please tell us what your
position is in relation to them and if you still consider yourself as their
subordinate.
       “Yes, I have seen them; they were present when I arrived here. I
must humbly confess that they consider me superior to themselves.”
       Did you have any particular reason for being so fond of them
rather than of someone else?
       “No obligatory reason. I could have achieved my purposes
elsewhere. However, I chose them in order to pay off a debt of
gratitude I felt I owed them. In a former life, they had been kind
toward me and had rendered me service.”
       What do you think your future holds?

You might think me quite presumptuous, but I am speaking to
you from the readiness of my character. Furthermore, I submit
myself to God’s will.”
      We thank you for having answered our evocation. We have no
doubt that God will give you his blessings.

may you all experience the pure bliss that has been granted to me!”

                        Clara Rivier
       Clara was a 10-year-old girl, the daughter of a family of
laborers in the south of France. At the age of 4 she became severely
ill. During her short life she was never heard to complain or show
any sign of impatience, and even though she had no education, she
consoled her stricken family by commenting on the future life and
the happiness that she would find there. She died in September
of 1862 after 4 days of torture and convulsions, during which she
never stopped praying to God. “I’m not afraid to die,” she said,
“because a happy life is reserved for me afterward.” She said to her
weeping father, “Take comfort; I will come to visit you. I feel my
hour is near, and when it arrives I’ll know and warn you.” And
indeed, when the fatal moment was upon her, she called her family
and said, “I have only five minutes left; give me your hands.” And
she expired as she had announced.
       Afterward, a rapping spirit began visiting the Rivier’s home.
It disrupted everything; it struck the table as if it had a club; it
shook clothes and the draperies, and rattled dinnerware. Under
Clara’s form, this spirit appeared to her youngest sister, who was
only 5 years old. According to this child, her sister often appeared
to her and such apparitions caused her to exclaim joyfully, “But see
how pretty Clara is!”

       1. Evocation of Clara Rivier.
       “I’m next to you and ready to respond.”
       2. Although you were so young, where did you get such elevated
ideas about the future life?
       “From the short amount of time I had to spend on your
planet, and from my previous incarnation. I was a medium
both when I left the earth that time and when I came back
among you. It was predestination; I sensed and saw what I
spoke about.”
       3. How could a child of your age not complain at all during
four years of suffering?
       “Because my physical suffering was controlled by a greater
power – that of my guardian angel, whom I saw constantly beside
me. He was able to mitigate what I experienced. He rendered my
willpower stronger than the suffering.”
       4. How did you foresee the moment of your death?
       “My guardian angel told it to me; he never deceived me.”
       5. You told your father: ‘Take comfort; I will come to visit you.’
But how do you explain the fact that, although animated by these good
sentiments toward your parents, you have returned to trouble them by
causing such disturbances in their home?
       “I obviously have a trial – or rather, a mission – to fulfill. If
I have returned to see my parents, do you think it is for nothing?
The noises and disturbances, the struggles resulting from my
presence are a warning. I am aided by other spirits who cause the
disturbances for a reason, just as I have my reasons for appearing to
my little sister. Thanks to us, many will be convinced. My parents
have had to experience this trial. It will soon pass, but not before
having convinced a lot of [incarnate] spirits.”
       6. So you aren’t personally causing the disturbances?
       “I’m helped by other spirits who are serving in the trial
reserved for my parents.”

                            Earthly Expiations


       7. Then how do you explain the fact that your little sister has
recognized you if you are not the one who is causing the manifestations?
       “She has seen only me. She has second sight for the time
being, and this will not be the last time that my presence will
comfort and encourage her.”
       8. Why were you affected by so many infirmities at such a young age?
       “I had previous wrongs to expiate. In a prior existence, I
abused my health as well as the outstanding position I enjoyed.
Thus, God said to me, ‘You have enjoyed too much and without
restraint; therefore, you shall suffer in like manner; you have been
proud, so you shall be humble; you have been vain about your
beauty and thus you shall fall from it; instead of vanity, you shall
struggle to acquire charity and goodness.’ I fulfilled God’s will and
my guardian angel helped me.”
       9. Would you like for us to say anything to your parents?
       “At the request of a medium, my parents have practiced a
great deal of charity; they were right in not praying with their lips:
charity must be practiced by hand and heart. Giving to those who
suffer: that is prayer; that is what it means to be a Spiritist.
       God has granted freewill to all souls, that is, the faculty to
progress; he has given everyone the same inspiration, and that is why
the humble homespun garment is much closer to the gold-stitched
robe than one might generally suppose. Therefore, close social gaps
through charity; give shelter in your home to the poor; encourage
them, uplift them; do not humiliate them. If we knew how to practice
this great law of conscience everywhere, one would not witness the
huge misfortunes that beset civilizations from time to time, and which
are sent by God to punish them and open their eyes.
       “My dear parents, pray to God; love each other; practice
the law of Christ: Do not do unto others what you would not
want them to do unto you. Appeal to God, who tries you in order
to show that his will is great and holy as he himself is. Prepare


                                   441

                         Part 2 - Chapter VIII


yourselves for the future by arming yourselves with courage and
perseverance, for you have been called to suffer further. Suffering is
necessary to know how to merit a good position on a better world,
where the comprehension of divine justice becomes punishment
for evil spirits.
       “My dear parents, I will always be near you. Goodbye, or
rather, until we meet again. Be resigned, be charitable, love your
fellow beings and one day you shall be happy.”
       Clara
       This is a beautiful image: “The humble homespun garment
is much closer to the gold-stitched robe than one might generally
suppose.” This is an allusion to spirits, who from one existence to
the next, go from an outstanding position to a humble or miserable
one, for they often expiate in an adverse environment their abuse
of the gifts that God has bestowed on them. This is the kind of
justice that everyone comprehends.
       Another thought, no less deep, is the one that attributes
collective calamities to the infraction of divine law, for God
punishes nations as well as individuals. Surely, if the law of charity
were practiced, there would be neither wars nor great misery.
Spiritism leads to the practice of such faith. Is that perhaps the
reason why it encounters so many bitter enemies? Are this child’s
exhortations to her parents those of a demon?

       Françoise had been blind from birth, the daughter of a
tenant farmer from around Toulouse. She died in 1855 at the age
of 45. She kept herself occupied by teaching Catechism to children
in preparation for their first communion. When the Catechism
was changed, she had no difficulty teaching them the new one
because she knew both by heart. One winter night as she was with

an aunt and returning from a journey to several places, she had to
cross a forest on dreadfully muddy paths. The two women had to
walk carefully on the edge of the ditches. Her aunt wanted to lead
her by the hand, but she said, “Don’t worry about me. I’m in no
danger of falling. I see a light on my shoulders and it is guiding
me. Follow me; I’m the one who is going to guide you.” Thus, they
arrived home without incident, the blind woman having led the
one who could use her eyes.

             (Evocation in Paris, May of 1865)

       Would you be so kind as to explain to us the light which guided
you on that dark night and which only you could see?
       “Excuse me!? People like you, who are in constant relation
with spirits, need an explanation for an incident like that one? It
was my guardian angel who was guiding me.”
       That was what we thought, but we wanted you to confirm it.
Were you aware at the time that it was your guardian angel leading you?
       “No, I’ll admit, although I did believe in heavenly protection.
I had prayed for so long for the good God to take pity on me! ...
Being blind is so cruel ... Yes, it is very cruel! But I also realize
that it was just. Those who sin with their eyes must be punished
through their eyes, and such is the case with all the other faculties
with which humans are endowed and which they abuse. Thus,
don’t look for any other cause for the numerous misfortunes
affecting humankind than that which is natural, that is, expiation;
expiation which is only meritorious when borne with humility but
which can be mitigated through prayer by attracting the spiritual
influences that protect the guilty of the human penitentiary and
infuse hope and consolation into afflicted and suffering hearts.”
       You devoted yourself to teaching religion to poor children.
Although it had been changed in form, and despite your blindness,

                          Part 2 - Chapter VIII


was it difficult for you to acquire the necessary understanding of the
Catechism you knew so well?
        “Ordinarily, the other senses of the blind are doubled, if I may
express myself like that. Observation is not one of the least faculties
of their nature. Their memory is like an archive wherein teachings
related to their aptitudes and inclinations are set permanently in
order. Since nothing from the outside can disturb this faculty, it can
thus become remarkably developed through education. That wasn’t
my case, however, for I did not receive much education. I only thank
God for having enabled my education to be enough so that I could
fulfill my mission of devotion alongside those children, and which
was at the same time a reparation for the bad example I set for them
in a previous existence. Everything is a serious subject for Spiritists.
All they have to do is to look around them and it will be more useful
than if they were to allow themselves to be misled by the philosophical
subtleties of certain spirits who mock them by flattering their pride
with phrases of great effect but devoid of good sense.”
        By your language, we deem you to be intellectually advanced
just as your conduct on earth gave us proof that you were morally
advanced.
        “There is still much for me to acquire. However, on the
earth there are many people who are mistaken for simpletons
because their intelligence has been veiled by expiation. With
death, the veil falls and quite often these poor simpletons turn
out to be more educated than those whose disdain they aroused.
You can be sure that pride is the touchstone for recognizing
people. All those whose heart is accessible to flattery, or who
have too much confidence in their own knowledge, are on the
wrong path. Usually, they are not sincere; be wary of them. Be
as humble as Christ was and carry your cross like he did – with
love – in order to access the kingdom of heaven.”

                          Anna Bitter
       To be struck by the loss of a beloved child is an excruciating
cause of grief; however, seeing an only child, the object of all your
highest hopes, on whom your only affection has been concentrated,
wither before your eyes and fade without pain due to unknown
causes, is one of those whims of nature that baffles science. Exhausting
all your resources on the matter, becoming certain that there is no
hope, and bearing this anguish every day for many years without
seeing an end to it, is cruel suffering. It is the kind of suffering that
wealth aggravates rather than mitigates, because you had hoped that
such wealth would someday be enjoyed by this beloved person.
       Such was the situation of Anna Bitter’s father, his soul seized
by somber despair and his character growing more and more
embittered before a distressing spectacle whose end result – albeit
indeterminate – could only be fatal. A family friend and disciple
of Spiritism believed he ought to ask his protector spirit regarding
the matter and received the following response:
       “I greatly desire to explain this strange phenomenon, for I
know that your asking me does not derive from indiscrete curiosity
but from your interest in this poor child. Because you believe in
divine justice, it will be a beneficial teaching. Those whom the Lord
wills to strike must bow their head and not rebel, for there is never
punishment without cause. This poor girl, whose death sentence
has been suspended by God, must soon return to be among us,
for God has taken pity on her, and her father – that unhappy man
in your midst – must be punished through his sole affection in
this world for having mocked the trust and sentiments of those
around him. For the time being, his repentance has touched the
Omnipotent and death has withheld its blow from her dear head.
But his rebelliousness is returning and punishment always follows
rebellion. Be happy that it is on earth that you are punished! Pray,

my friends, for this poor child, whose tender age will render her
last moments difficult. The sap of youth is so abundant in this poor
being that, in spite of her frail state, her soul will have difficulty
disengaging itself. Oh pray! Later, she will help and console you,
for her spirit is more evolved that those around her.
       “Due to special permission from our Lord, I was able to
answer what you have asked me, since it is necessary that this spirit
be helped to make her disengagement easier.”
       The father died later after having suffered the emptiness
from losing his daughter. Following are the first communications
which both gave after their respective deaths.
       The daughter: “Thank you, my friend, for being concerned
about this poor child and for having followed the counsels of your
good guide. Yes, thanks to your prayers it was easier for me to leave
my earthly envelope behind because my father ... Alas! He didn’t
pray; he cursed! I’m not upset with him, however. It was the result
of his great tenderness for me. I beg God to grant him the grace of
being enlightened before he dies. I encourage him and my mission
is to soften his final moments. There are times when it seems that
divine light enters him; however, it is nothing more than a passing
light and he quickly relapses into his old thoughts. He only has
one seed of faith in him, but it is suffocated by worldly interests
and will only sprout by means of new and more dreadful trials – at
least that is what I fear. On my part, I only had the remnants of an
expiation to endure and thus it was neither very painful nor very
difficult. I didn’t suffer during my peculiar infirmity; I was more of
an instrument of trial for my father, for he suffered more at seeing
me in such a state than I did. I was resigned to it, he was not. Now
I have been rewarded. God granted me the grace of shortening my
stay on the earth – for which I thank him. I am happy amidst the
good spirits who surround me. We are all carrying out our duties
with joy, because idleness would be cruel suffering.”

                              Earthly Expiations


        The father (about one month after his death):
        Our purpose in evoking you is to inquire about your situation in
the spirit world so that we might be useful to you to the best of our abilities.
        “The world of spirits? I can’t see it. I can only see the people
I knew, but who do not think of me or miss me; on the contrary,
they seem content at being free of me.”
        Are you well aware of your condition?
        “Perfectly; for a while I thought I still belonged to your
world, but I now know very well that I do not.”
        Then why can’t you see other spirits around you?
        “I don’t know. Everything is clear around me.”
        Have you seen your daughter yet?
        “No, she is dead. I have looked for her and have called for her
in vain. What an awful emptiness her death left in me! When I died, I
thought there could be no doubt that I would meet her – but nothing!
Always this isolation around me! No one gives me a word of hope or
consolation. Goodbye. I am going to go look for my child.”
        The medium’s Guide: “This man was neither an atheist nor
a materialist, but one of those who vaguely believe without being
concerned about God and their future because they are so absorbed
with earthly interests. He was profoundly selfish and would
undoubtedly have sacrificed everything to save his daughter, but he
would also have unscrupulously sacrificed other people’s interests to
his own advantage. Except for his daughter, he was not attached to
anyone. God punished him, as you know, taking from him his sole
consolation on earth. And since he did not repent, she is also kept
from his sight in the world of spirits. He took no interest in anyone
while on earth; here, no one takes an interest in him. He is alone
and abandoned – that is his punishment. Nevertheless, his daughter
is close to him even though he does not see her. If he could see her, he
would not be punished. But what does he do? Does he speak to God?
Does he repent? No. He continues to complain, even to blaspheme;

in other words, he does what he did on earth. So help him through
prayer and counsel so that he may come out of his blindness.”

            Joseph Maitre – A Blind Man
       Joseph Maitre belonged to the middle class of society and
enjoyed a modest income that protected him from need. His
parents provided him with a good education and meant for him
to go into business; however, at age twenty he lost his sight. He
died in 1845, when he was almost 50. Around ten years prior
to his death, he was struck with a second infirmity that left him
completely deaf; thus, he could only relate to the world of the
living through the sense of touch. Not being able to see was in
itself very hard, but not being able to hear was double torture;
having at first enjoyed all his faculties, he felt even more the results
of this two-fold privation. What could he have done to deserve
such a cruel fate? It was not his last existence, for he had always
displayed exemplary conduct. He was a good son with a gentle and
benevolent character, and when he found that he had been deprived
of hearing, he accepted the new trial with resignation. One never
heard him utter a single complaint. His speech displayed perfect
lucidity of spirit and an uncommon intelligence.
       A person who had known him thought that useful
instruction might be received by talking with his spirit. He was
evoked and the following communication was received in response
to the questions addressed to him.

                           (Paris, 1863)

      “My friends, I thank you for having remembered me,
although maybe you would not have even thought of me if you
hadn’t expected to reap some benefit from my communication;

                                  448

                          Earthly Expiations


nonetheless, I know that your motives are authentic. Thus, I am
pleased to have answered your call, and since I have been allowed
to do so, I am happy to be able to serve for your instruction. May
my example add to the many proofs that spirits have provided you
regarding the justice of God.
       You knew me to be blind and deaf, and you have asked
yourselves what I had done to deserve such a fate. I am going to
tell you. First of all, it was the second time that I was deprived
of sight. During my previous existence at the beginning of the
last century, I went blind at 30 years of age due to excesses of all
kinds, which ruined my health and weakened my organs. It was
already a punishment for having abused the gifts I received from
Providence, for I was very talented. But instead of realizing the fact
that I was the original cause of my infirmity, I accused that same
Providence, in whom I believed very little anyway. I blasphemed
against God; I denied him and accused him by saying that if he
did actually exist, then he must be unjust and evil for making his
creatures suffer as I did. On the contrary, I should have considered
myself fortunate because, unlike so many other unfortunate blind
people, I didn’t have to beg for my bread. But, no, I only thought
about myself and about the privations that had been imposed on
me. Under the control of such ideas and due to my lack of faith, I
became cantankerous and demanding; in other words, unbearable
to those who were close to me. From then on, life was purposeless;
I couldn’t think of the future except as a chimera. After futilely
exhausting all the resources of science and realizing that my healing
was impossible, I decided to end it all: I committed suicide.
       Upon my awakening, alas! I found myself immersed in
the same darkness I had been in during life! However, it didn’t
take long to understand that I did not belong to the corporeal
world, but that I was now a blind spirit! Life beyond the grave was
thus a reality! I tried in vain to escape from it, to plunge myself


                                 449

                          Part 2 - Chapter VIII


into nothingness, but ended up simply clashing with the void.
If this life were eternal – as I had heard – would I be then in
this situation for the rest of eternity? That thought was dreadful.
I wasn’t suffering, but to describe the anguish and torment of my
spirit is impossible. How long did it last? I don’t know. But it
seemed so very, very long!
        “Exhausted and weary, a change finally came over me. I
understood that a higher power was weighing down on me and
I told myself that if this power could oppress me, it could also
comfort me, and so I begged for mercy. As I prayed and as my
fervor increased, something told me that my cruel situation
would have an end. The light finally dawned and my rapture was
boundless at beholding the heavenly brightness. I could perceive
benevolently smiling spirits – those who surrounded me as well as
those who hovered radiantly in space. I wanted to follow them,
but an invisible force held me back. Then one of them said to me,
‘The God whom you use to deny has noticed your return to him
and has allowed us to restore your sight, but you have yielded only
because of constraint and exhaustion. If from now on you want to
share in the bliss that we enjoy here, you must prove the sincerity
of your repentance and good sentiments by recommencing your
earthly trial under conditions that will expose you to falling again into
the same wrongs, for this new trial will be even harsher than the
last.’ I eagerly accepted, promising not to fail again.
        “Thus, I returned to earth under the conditions you are
aware of. It wasn’t difficult for me to be good, because I wasn’t
evil by nature; I had revolted against God and God had punished
me. I returned with an inborn faith, and that is the reason why I
no longer complained against him, but rather accepted my dual
infirmity with resignation and as an expiation which had to have
its origin in Sovereign Justice. I felt no desperation during the
isolation of my closing years, for I had faith in the future and in


                                  450

                           Earthly Expiations


God’s mercy. The isolation was very beneficial because during that
long night, wherein all was silence, my soul more freely uplifted
itself to the Eternal, foreseeing the infinite through thought. When
my exile was finally over, the spirit world provided me only with
splendors and ineffable delight.
        “In comparison with my past, I deem my situation relatively
very happy and I give thanks to God for it. However, when I look
to the future, I see how distant I still am from perfect bliss. I have
completed my expiation, but I must still make reparations. My latest
existence was only profitable to me alone, and now I hope soon to start
a new existence where I can be useful to others, thereby repairing
my previous uselessness. Only then will I be able to advance on the
blessed path opened to all spirits of goodwill.
        “That is my story, my friends. If my example can help to
enlighten any of my incarnate brothers and help them avoid the
plight into which I had fallen, I will have begun to repay my debt.”
