SEVEN years have passed since this essay was written, and the MSS.
pages have been lent to many friends and students of mystic lore and
occult meanings. It is only at the earnest request of these kindly
critics that I have consented to publish this volume. The contents are
necessarily of a fragmentary character, and have been collected from an
immense number of sources; the original matter has been intentionally
reduced to the least possible quantity, so as to obtain space for the
inclusion of the utmost amount of ancient, quaint, and occult learning.
It is impossible to give even an approximate list of works which have
been consulted; direct quotations have been acknowledged in numerous
instances, and (perhaps naturally) many a statement might have been
equally well quoted from the book of a contemporary author, a mediæval
monk, a Roman historian, a Greek poet, or a Hindoo Adept: to give
the credit to the modern author would not be fair to the ancient sage,
to refer the reader to a Sanscrit tome would be in most cases only loss
of time and waste of paper. My great difficulty has been to supply
information mystic enough to match the ideal of the work, and yet not
so esoteric as to convey truths which higher Masters have ordered to be
still concealed. Esoteric knowledge is open to all who with ardour
combined with humility seek it, but it is not to be offered to the scorner
as an object for contumely.
I must apologise for the barbarous appearance of foreign words, but
it was not found practicable to supply Sanscrit, Coptic, Chaldee and
Greek type, so the words have had to be translated. Hebrew and
Chaldee should of course be read from right to left, and it was at first
intended so to print them in their converted form, but the appearance
of Hebrew in English letters reversed was too grotesque; ADNI is a
representation of the Aleph, daleth, nun, yod, of " Adonai," but INDA is
MABS.
