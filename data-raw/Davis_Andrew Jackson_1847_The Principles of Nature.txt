SCRIBE'S INTRODUCTION.
BIOGRAPHICAIe SKETCH OF TIIE AUTHOR, AND HISTORY OF TIIE
PRODUCTION OF THIS VOLUME.
A woru of unprecedented character is here presented to the world. It
consists of the consecutive reasonings and revelations of a spirit freed, by a
certain physical process, the philosophy of which is explained, from the obstructing influence of the material organization, and exalted to a position which
gave access to a knowledge of the structure and laws of the whole material
and spiritual Universe. It treats upon subjects of the profoundest interest and
of the most unspeakable importance to the human race; and as its claims are
confessedly of the most startling character, and its professed disclosures, with the
phenomena attending them, are in some respects unparalleled in the history of
psychology, it is certainly no more than just that the world should be furnished
with a plain, concise, yet circumstantial account of the author of the book, with
a history of its origin and production, and with the means of either verifying
or refuting what is said concerning the source from which it sprang, and the
means employed in its production. A few preliminary remarks, however, are
deemed proper as introductory to the statements herein to be submitted.
It is obvious to every intelligent mind that the condition of the human race,
socially, nationally, mentally, and spiritually, is continually changing. There
is at present no civilized nation upon the globe which does not present a
totally different aspect as to manners, customs, social structure, science, art,
religion, and all the conventionalisms of life, from any nation existing upon
the earth four thousand years ago. Every period of human history shows,
upon the whole, a distinct progress in the condition of mankind beyond that
(of previous periods. Instances of apparent retrogression, as in the cases of
the various catastrophes that have occurred at different periods during the geo-.logical history of the earth, only exhibit the apparent disorder incident to a
transition from a lower to a higher state of development. In passing through
the uncouth semi-barbarism of the early ages to the refinements and intellectual and artistic attainments of the nineteenth century, the race has of course
passed through every intermediate stage of cultivation; anid a close observation
and analysis will prove that every decided stage of human progress has been
accompanied by new and distinct mental and social wants; and in order that
these might be duly supplied, new resources have been invariably opened, and
new instrumentalities have been instituted.

iv                        INTRODUCTION.
It would require but little argument, therefore, aside from the fact that
change is perpetual, to prove that the mental and social wants of the present
differ essentially from those of any previous generation. Perhaps at no period
in the world's history so little characterized by revolutionary violence, has the
general mental and social condition of mankind undergone changes so marked
and conspicuous as during the last century. In respect to all matters of science,
particularly, has there been an immense unfolding; and the mechanical and
economic arts have been correspondingly improved. The seven seals of the
great geologcal book have been broken, and its, rocky leaves have disclosed
the physical history of the earth for millions of years. Powerful telescopes
have penetrated the abysses of space, and the grandeur and harmony of the
Universe have been unfolded to an extent far transcending all previous conception: and the researches in the departments of chemistry, physiology, and comparative anatomy, are constantly proving more and more conspicuously that
all things are but parts inseparably connected in one grand System. All these
sublime results of science tend to expand the mind beyond the narrow circle of
which self is the centre, and to unite the soul with those things which it beholds, contemplates, and admires. Man is thus made deeply sensible that he
is a mere atom in infinite space, surrounded by beings and creations unspeakably more important than himself; and as he contemplates the wide-spread
fields of creation, teeming with tokens of impartial favor, a flame of philanthropy is enkindled in his soul that consumes all narrow prejudices and selfish
inclinations, and he sympathizes with universal Man as the great Body of
which he is a mere organ.
Such are the moral and social tendencies of the science of the age, even considering the same in the more abstract point of view. But from the same
source more important influences indirectly arise. From the materials of science the busy hand of mechanism is forming filaments to bind together the extremities of each nation, and is developing the resources, exchanging the commodities, and harmonizing the interests, of every clime. Iron steeds, nerved
by the stimulus of the expanding vapor, are plunging through the ocean, measuring the distance between the two hemispheres by the lapse of a few days, or
prancing to and fro in the earth, facilitating exchanges and promoting friendly
intercourse between all communities and people. The imponderable elements
have been laid under contribution, and, by the subtle agency of the electric
fluid, man converses with his neighbor at the distance of a thousand miles with
the same facility with which two would converse a few rods apart. The veins,
and arteries, and nerves, of the great Body of humanity, are thus being developed, in the form of steamships, and railroads, and magnetic telegraphs, and
its muscles and sinews are being unfolded in the form of labor-saving and productive machinery. And all science and art tend powerfully to extend the
fibres and channels of communication thus being unfolded, throughout the whole
earth, and thus to form of the whole race one harmonious Body, possessing one common spring of action, one common social and theological system,
and bound together with one chain of sympathy running through all its diversified parts.
Such, we say, are the conspicuous and powerful tendencies of all the scientific and artistic attainments of the age. But to these tendencies there exist
the most powerful obstructions, which have thus far defied all attempts of phi

lanthropists and reformers to remove. These obstructions consist in the local
prejudices, and the social, national, commercial, and theological antagonisms,
that prevail throughout the whole earth. All men and communities are anxious for the establishment of a more intimate unity in the race, but each desires
that this unity should be founded on the basis of his own peculiar system. The
Calvinist would have the whole world form one harmonious brotherhood, possessing one faith, one hope, and one baptism, but then he would have them all
Calvinists; the Arminian desires the same union, but only on the basis of his
own theological system. The Catholic desires that all should become Catholics, and only on this ground will he consent to a union with others. The Jews
desire a unity of the race, but they desire first to be restored to the land of Palestine, and then that all Gentile nations should unite as their subordinates under
the reign of their expected Messiah. The intelligent Mohammedan desires the
establishment and perfection of the universal brotherhood, but he demands that
every man should first devoutly exclaim, "Allah is God, and Mohammed is
his prophet."  And the same remarks might with equal propriety be extended
to all parties, sects, denominations, and religionists, throughout the whole
earth. All are equally sincere in their opinions, and equally zealous in their
proclamation, each believing that his own system is sanctioned by the Deity;
though as the devotees of all social, national, and especially theological systems, derive their opinions from the fortuitous circumstances of birth and early
education, it is impossible that more than one out of the thousand can be right,
and the extreme probability is that all are wrong. And while the followers
of each system pray fervently and labor diligently for the conversion of the
whole world, all are mutually and purposely obstructing the efforts of each
other; and the obstruction creates impatience, jealousy, bigotry, fanaticism,
and every species of hostility and persecution that now so unhappily distract
the human race, and array brother against brother, and community against
community, causing the truly philanthropic soul to weep in hopeless despondency.
It is clear to every mind that so long as these diversified antagonisms in society exist throughout the world, so long that universal peace, brotherly love,
and social and national unity, so devoutly to be desired, can not possibly take
place. The all-absorbing desire of the enlightened philanthropist, therefore, is
that these antagonisms may be removed by the institution of some grand and
universal System of thought and action, based upon the nature of things and
the true relations of men to each other. This, therefore, should be considered
as the true and great leading want of the human mind at the present more than
at any previous age of the world; and who shall judge a priori that in the unvarying laws of the All-Wise Being, provisions may not have been made to
supply this as well as all real wants of the human race at all previous ages?
And when to the foregoing remarks is superadded the consideration that neither reason nor any previous revelation authorizes the belief that the channels
of spiritual communication with this lower world have been permanently
closed, may we not expect a respectful attention to the following statement
and remarks, and also such a candid perusal of the volume herewith submitted,
as may enable the reader properly to judge what relation (if any) the same
bears to those very demands of the age which are of all others the most press
sillg? —

Vi                        INTRODUCTION.
ANDREW JACKSON DAVIS, the youthful author of this book, is, while in his
normal state, distinguished by no mental or physical peculiarities that would
be likely to excite the particular attention of any merely superficial observer.
He is of the ordinary stature, with a well-proportioned physical frame, possessing a bilious-sanguine-nervous temperament. His features are prominent,
and his head is of the medium size, and very smoothly developed, especially
in the frontal and coronal regions. The base of the brain is small, except in
the region of the perceptives, which are prominent. The head Is covered with
a profusion of jet-black hair. The expression of his countenance is mild,
placid, and indicative of a peculiar degree of frankness and benevolence; and
from his eyes beams forth a peculiar radiance which we have never witnessed
in any other person. This is especially the case in his moments of interior
meditation and mental expansion. His inferior passions are only moderately
developed, and are completely under the control of reason and the moral sentiments. During daily intercourse with him fobr eighteen months, we have
never known him to manifest the least degree of anger or impatience, though
we have known him to be severely tried. He is very fond of congenial society, though he is peculiarly sensitive to what are in his book called the
"spheres" of certain individuals, or the influence or atmosphere emanating
from them. Thus he is instinctively either attracted to or repelled from a man
on first coming into his presence, and from the same cause he generally forms
a judgment of human character at first sight, which, as to accuracy, we have
seldom if ever known to fail. This sensitiveness to spheres forms a striking
trait in his character. He has a most ardent and devoted attachment to his
friends. He recognises no enemies, though the presence of some persons, especially of those who are conceited, bigoted, or dogmatical, seems to give him
pain; and such he accordingly avoids. To congenial spirits he is inclined to
be communicative; and his address is natural and easy, though devoid of all
artificiality. His disposition is characterized by an equanimity and cheerfulness which apparently no circumstance, however depressing, can disturb. His
mind acts with vivacity, and he is rather strongly inclined to mirthfulness,
though he informs us that this latter characteristic is often assumed in order to
counteract a natural tendency of the mind to abstraction, which forms another marked trait in his character. His imaginative faculties are well developed, though not so as to form a prominent trait in his character. A supreme
love of truth is the central point around which all his moral faculties revolve.
Hence he holds himself entirely open to conviction from all sources of information, and is ever ready to abandon preconceived opinions, however ardently
cherished, the moment he finds they are erroneous. It is from this cause thai
he manifests the utmost unconcern when his pretensions are attacked. His
benevolence is very active and steadfast, and is not confined to friends, associates, party, or sect, but extends to all classes of mankind. He thus takes the
utmost pleasure in relieving distress and in bestowing favors whenever opportunity affords, though his bestowments are always graduated by an acute dis.
crimination of the capacities of the individuals to appreciate and profitably
employ them. His perceptive and reflective faculties are well and evenly
developed; and the most prominent point in his intellectual character is an easy
and instinctive comprehension of great general principles and laws that govern
Nature and Mankind. His intellectual harmoniously blend with his moral fac.

alties to form a perfectly-balanced character; and as all hif, faculties are in a
nearly equal state of development, he is remarkably free from exaggeration or
"angular forms of thought," and is disposed to give to each subject which
he comprehends, all the importance which really and naturally belongs to it,
but no more. Hence his judgment is matured to a degree seldom witnessed in
those of a more mature age; and what, perhaps, is still more remarkable than
all is, that all his leading mental operations and outward actions appear to be
governed by a species of interior prompting. Upon the whole, therefore, he
may be considered as a most amiable, simple-hearted, truth-loving, and unsophisticated young man, being disconnected from all sects, parties, creeds, and
denominations, and governed solely by his own intuitions.
Such is a description of his character while in his normal state, as it has appeared to us during daily intercourse with him for the last eighteen months.
And it is owing to his peculiar physical and mental constitution that he has
been enabled, by the assistance of magnetism, to abstract himself from the
gross tangibilities of the outer world, and enter that state of exceeding spiritual
exaltation and mental expansion that has enabled him to dictate the book now
submitted to the world.
But the mind given mainly to sensuous processes of reasoning, in order to
feel justified in reposing full confidence in the authenticity of this book, will
require some account (such as he may either verify or refute) of Mr. Davis's
past history, of his acquirements by ordinary processes of education and mental discipline, and of the origin and production of this book. This reasonable
demand shall be gratified to the extent of our present ability; and the main
facts shall be substantiated by the testimony of disinterested persons.
A singular instance, showing Mr. Davis's indifference to things of no practical importance, consists in the fact that he did not until recently know where
he was born. At the earliest period to which his recollection extends, he resided with his parents in the township of Hyde Park, Dutchess county, New
York; and during two summers of his residence in that township, he was also
employed by Mr. W. W. Woodworth in the capacity of a keeper of cattle.
But his father recently informed us that he was born in Bloominggrove, Orange
county, New York, and that on the 11th of August, 1847, he will be twentyone years of age - according to which he must have been born on the 11th of
August, 1826. From Hyde Park he removed, with his father, to Poughkeepsie, on the first of September, 1838, after which, for some eighteen months, he
worked with his father at his trade. Immediately after this he was engaged
in the grocery of Mr. Nicholas Lawrence, which store his father subsequently
purchased, and in which he continued until the spring of 1841, when he bound
himself as an apprentice to Mr. Ira Armstrong.
His father is a simple-hearted unsophisticated man, who follows the respectable occupation of a shoemaker; and so far as this world's goods are concerned, he has always been very poor. His mother (long since deceased), we
are informed, was one of those gentle beings whose supreme delight it is to
mingle in scenes of sickness and sorrow, and to administer to the relief of suffering humanity. Neither father nor mother was particularly inclined to intellectual pursuits, and hence they felt no anxiety to bestow an education upon
their son extending beyond the simplest rudiments that may be acquired in a
common school. Owing to this fact, in connexion with the straitened financial

circumstances of the parents, the boy's school tuition was confined to about
five months, during which time he learned to read imperfectly, to write a fair
hand, and to do simple sums in arithmetic. From early youth, therefore, until
he entered on his clairvoyance career, he was mostly kept at such manual employments as were adapted to his age, during which time his little earnings
and affectionate attentions contributed greatly to the support of his immediate
family connexions. With these duties and responsibilities constantly pressing
upon his mind, he had neither desire nor opportunity to study and inform himself even upon the simplest branches of science, history, or general literature.
During the intervals between his hours of employment he was never known to
frequent public libraries, and was seldom known to take up a book; and his very
limited reading was confined to a few juvenile productions, fugitive essays, and
light romances, not, perhaps, comprising over four hundred or five hundred
pages at most; and even this little reading was pursued in the most desultory
manner. The frankness, openness, and sincerity, which have characterized the
boy from infancy to the present moment, and the probabilities arising from his
youth and inexperience in the arts of the world, forbid entirely the suspicion
that he could have been pursuing in secret any sinister designs upon the credulity of the world; and the restrictions which poverty imposed upon his mental
exertions, and the ten thousand incidentals connected with a daily and hourly
intercourse of some one or more persons with him, absolutely' forbid the possibility of his having in secret carried on a design of this kind, even had he been
morally capable of a fraud so palpable.
The foregoing facts are gathered from incidental and free conversations with
different persons who were familiarly acquainted with the young man from
early youth up to his forming a connexion with Dr. Lyon, and removing to
New York, in August, 1845.  To these statements we will add the following
testimonies from respectable citizens, the first of Hyde Park, the next three of
Poughkeepsie, and the last from Rev. A. R. Bartlett, now of Chicago:HYDE PARK, January 2, 1847.
DEAR SIR: In answer to yours of the 30th December last, asking some information respecting A. J. Davis, I can only say that he was born in this town* of poor
but respectable parents. His father, during the period of his (A. J.'s) early youth,
was in my employ some three or four years, during which time I saw the boy almost
every day. There was nothing remarkable in him, unless it might have been an
inquiring disposition, which, however, was not remarkable to a very great extent.
He was of good moral character. His only facilities for obtaining an education were
such as are afforded by a district school, which he was not much disposed to attend.
As to his natural talents, there was nothing that I ever saw to induce the belief that
they were either above or below mediocrity. In short, he was what might have been
called an ordinary, civil, well-disposed boy.
Yours, respectfully,        JOHN HINCHMAN.
POUGHRKEEPSIE, January 2, 1847.
FRIEND WmI. FISHBOUGH: Thine of the 30th of last month is received, requesting
of me to give thee what information I am in possession of in relation to the character, habits, &c., of A. J. Davis while a resident of our village.
The first I knew of him was when about sixteen years of'age, while he was an apprentice to the shoemaking business; and from that time I saw him very frequently
until he left the place, which was from two to three years after, I think. As to his
character and habits, I always believed them to be good; and his opportunities of
instruction, if he had any, were very limited. I believe him to be an uneducated
young man, and of very humble parentage.
Very respectfully thy friend,      E. C. SOUTHWICK.
That is a mistake, according to the statement of his father, mentioned above.

POUGHKEEPSIE, January 21, 1847.
DEAR SIR: In complying with your request, to write you an account of what I
know, whether favorable or otherwise, of the character, habits, education, &c., of
Mr. A. J. Davis, permit me to express my satisfaction at being enabled to render you
an account which is favorable. I have enjoyed a personal acquaintance of three
years with Mr. Davis, under circumstances favorable to obtaining a correct knowledge
of his character, &c.; and so fully persuaded am I of his moral worth and integrity,
that I would not hesitate to place implicit confidence in him under the most trying
circumstances. From seeing and conversing with him almost daily during the first
year of our acquaintance, and from the frequent subsequent intercourse we have
had, I have the assurance to think I know him as well as any other person; and,
such is the opinion'I have formed of him. His honesty, his frankness, his veracity,
his sensibility-in short, his virtue to the fullest extent in which this word can be
understood, are worthy of all praise. Of his education (that which he obtained at
school or from books, I mean), I am constrained to say it is of a very limited character, he having never received more than about five months' schooling, as he has often
stated to me; which statement is corroborated by the testimony of those who have
known him from his childhood. His reading has also been limited, and of a character
calculated to yield him no great benefit. It has served as a mere pastime-a mere
gratification for the moment. Indeed, he seemed to have no higher end in it than
amusement for the time being.
Yours, very respectfully,                S. S. LAPHAM.
The following letter from Mr. Armstrong, to whom young Davis was an
apprentice for about two years, is deserving of particular attention:POUGHKEEPSIE, January 9, 1847.
DEAR SIR: Your letter was received a few days ago, but I have lacked time to
answer it before now. The world, you say, may yet ask, Who is A. J. Davis? To
this question, so far as I am able, it shall have a frank and truthful answer. With
the early life of A. J. Davis I am altogether unacquainted, except from his own
account of it, sustained by the testimony of others. His father was in exceedingly
straitened circumstances; so much so, that Jackson was in very early life, and long
before I knew him, compelled to toil and watchfulness to aid in supporting his father's
family. I have often thought that it was this circumstance more than any other
which gave him habits of steadiness and sobriety far beyond his years. He was, I
think, near fifteen when I first became acquainted with him. I had occasion for the
services of a boy somewhat acquainted with the shoe-trade, and employed him for a
fortnight to assist me. During this time, I was so much pleased with his good sense
and industry, that, upon his own solicitation and the wish of his father, I took him as
an apprentice. His education barely amounted to a knowledge of reading, writing, and
the rudiments of arithmetic. His reading was exceedingly limited. and confined to that
of a light and juvenile description. During his two years of apprenticeship, he established a character for faithfulness and integrity not to be surpassed, and which is seldomn
equalled. There was no probability that we should have parted before the conclusion
of his apprenticeship, for we were mutually satisfied with each other.  But Mesmerism
stepped in between us; and Jackson being thought a prodigy in prescribing for and
curing disease, we parted, with the understanding that our separation was to be but
temporary. But circumstances have made it perpetual, so far as apprenticeship is
concerned.
Yours,          IRA ARMSTRONG.
Rev. A. R. Bartlett, now of Chicago, and author of the following letter,
was formerly a settled and esteemed pastor in Poughkeepsie:CIIICAGO, March 31, 1847.
MR. FISHBOUGH: You ask me for a frank statement of what I know of the mental and moral character, opportunities, acquirements, &c., of A. J. Davis, during the
period of, my intercourse and acquaintance with him. In reply, permit me to say
that I first became acquainted with A. J. Davis in Poughlieepsie, N. Y., early in the
year 1842. At that time, and until his services were wholly absorbed by the mesmeric art, he was engaged in the business of shoemaking. He had no mother living;
his father was very industrious, but poor. Hence, at a tender age, the subject of this
sketch was thrown to a great extent, if not wholly, upon his own exertions for the
means of support and progress. This, at least, was his condition when I formed his

acquaintance. What his earliest opportunities may have been, I can not testify from
personal knowledge. But at the date of our intimacy, no one could resist the conviction that his advanlages had not been sufficient to give him common proficiency in
the simplest elements of the English language.  Decided disadvantages were all
around him, and so continued, so far as obtaining an education was concerned; for
during my acquaintance with him, which was most intimate from A. D. 1842 to 1845
(and continued by correspondence till recently), he had not an hour's schooling, nor
could he have afforded it consistently with his circumstances. Yet he possessed an
inquiring mind-loved books, especially controversial religious works, which he
always preferred, whenever he could borrow them and obtain leisure for their perusal. Hence, he was indebted to his individual exertions for some creditable advances
which he made in knowledge. He became a good thinker. Still, his natural method
of communication at times tended to obscure his thoughts, through a misuse of
words. His orthography and syntax were often faulty.
The singular powers claimed for Mr. Davis were first brought into public notice
by the experimental assistance of Mr. William Levingston, by whom he continued to
be mesmerized for many months. This was not far from October, 1843. In his natural appearance, deportment, or opportunities, no change was observable at this or
any other period of my acquaintance with him. There was nothing in his general
deportment or character that would attract the attention of those who were not his
intimates, except it might be the fact that he had few associates of his own age, and
preferred the society of more experienced men: though a few companions suited him
better than many. He was always fond of asking questions, but had no power to
conceal his object in proposing them; very communicative to those whom he regarded
as friends-moderately so to others. His veracity, so far as I have been able to observe-and I have criticised him closely-could be depended upon. I know that he
would suffer much inconvenience rather than descend to untruthfulness. He was
always cheerful and pleasant, and at times rather inclined to levity through the
natural exuberance of his spirits. Over the latter, however, he held a strong control. He was rather devotional in his feelings, with very strong sympathies in behalf
of the struggling and suffering; an ardent temperance man; and his moral character was worthy of general approbation. Indeed, I fully believe that he aimed to be
governed by high and holy principles. That I am qualified to make the above statements you can easily judge, when I tell you that, as long as opportunity allowed, we
were intimate almost without reserve, and the mutual confidants of each other.
A. R. BARTLETT.
Many more testimonies of like tenor with the above might be collected, but
these are deemed sufficient, at least for the present.
We will now present a brief history of Mr. Davis's career in clairvoyance,
Including an account of the origin and production of this book.
In the autumn of 1843, a Mr. Grimes delivered in Poughkeepsie a number
of lectures on Animal Magnetism, performing during his course a number of
illustrative experiments. Among the persons on whom Mr. Grimes essayed
to operate was young Davis; but in this instance his most powerful efforts
failed to produce any apparent effect. By his lectures and the successful experiments accompanying them, however, considerable excitement was created
in the village concerning this important branch of psychological science; and
among others who were induced to test their own powers in producing the
magnetic phenomenon, was Mr. WILLIAMI LEVINGSTON. Young Davis happening into the tailor-shop of Mr. Levingston during the general excitement, the
latter gentleman proposed a trial to magnetize him. The experiment which
followed succeeded; and the boy exhibited powers of clairvoyance which were
truly surprising. A great variety of tests were submitted, such as requiring
him to visit and describe places which he had never seen, to read from a closed
volume with his eyes bandaged, &c.; and the result was to establish his power
of interior sight beyond dispute. This experiment took place about the first of
December, 1843.

INTRODUCTION.                            xi
From that -time forward the boy was frequently thrown into the abnormal
state, and Mr. Levingston's house was for months the common resort of the
curious who were indiscriminately invited to come and witness the experiments. But after submitting for two or three months to all species of tests for
no other purpose than that of gratifying curiosity and establishing the reality
of the clairvoyant state, the boy, while in the latter state, protested against
being longer subjected to any tests, except such as might involve matters of
practical utility - informing Mr. Levingston that the great object of his powers
in the stage of development to which they had then attained, was to enable him
to examine, and prescribe for, the diseased. Shortly after this, he left Mr. Armstrong, to whom he was an apprentice, and entered, with his magnetizer Mr.
L., into the exclusive employment of treating the diseased, in which employment, as it appears from all the testimonies we have received, he was surprisingly successful. Not long after this, and by progressive stages, his scientific
powers became immensely unfolded; and there was no science the general
principles and much of minutiae of which he did not seem to comprehend while
in his abnormal state. He also from time to time presented many novel and
highly-interesting ideas concerning the nature and powers of the human soul,
seeming to demonstrate an intimate connexion between the present and the
spirit world.
On the 7th of March, 1844, he fell, without the assistance of the magnetic
process, into a strange abnormal state, during which phenomena occurred of the
most surprising character. For the greater part of the time during two days,
he seemed to be entirely insensible to all external things, and to live wholly in
the interior world. Possessing, however, an increased power over his physical
system, he travelled a long distance during this time, without any apparent
fatigue. It was during this extraordinary state of his mental and physical system that he received information of a very general character, of his future and
peculiar mission to the world. The process by which this information was
received, with many other things of intense interest, shall be made public after
questions by which the phenomena may be rationalized shall have been more
thoroughly discussed on independent grounds. By minds duly prepared, it may
now be conceived on reading the portion of this volume which treats on the.
Spiritual Spheres.
The reader is now requested to observe that, according to the foregoing statements (which are open to refutation if false), the first magnetic experiment
performed on Mr. Davis by Mr. Levingston was manifestly suggested by thfe
prevailing excitement growing out of Mr. Grimes's lectures and experiments
it was apparently the casual prompting of a momentary thought, and not theresult of a long-premeditated and ingeniously-arranged plot. Let it also be observed that on the performance of this first experiment, the boy Davis suddenly
became a general object of interest such as he had not been before, and was
freely visited and tested by numerous persons while he was (professedly at
least) under the influence of magnetism. Now unless the reality of some strange:
abnormal condition is admitted, some more rational explanation shouldccer-.
tainly be given of this uneducated, unsophisticated young, boy thus suddenly,
and to all appearance accidentally, being brought out from obscurity, and becoming a public wonder on account of his strange and; inexplicable powers.
But if an actual abnormal and inexplicable condition.s admitted, the reader?

should reflect before deciding against the possibility of anything that is claimed
as growing out of that condition in a due state of development.
If, from the time the boy was first magnetized until the time he left Mr.
Armstrong (which was some three months or more subsequently), the former
had made any considerable effort by reading to inform himself upon anatomical, physiological, astronomical, geological, or psychological subjects, the latter
would certainly have discovered the fact and mentioned it in his letter which
we have inserted above. Besides, the proficiency in these subjects which could
have been made under those circumstances by such a boy, could have been but
little even with the most diligent efforts.
Up to this time, therefore, his education, according to Mr. Armstrong, " barely
amounted to a knowledge of reading, writing, and the rudiments of arithmetic"
- and " his reading was exceedingly limited and confined to that of a light and
juvenile description." At this period (which was in March, 1844) we find
him entering on a career of medical practice, in which he sustained himself to
the utmost satisfaction of all patients who gave him a fair trial, until April
10, 1847, after which time he ceased to be magnetized for an indefinite period.
During Mr. Davis's exclusive connexion with Mr. Levingston (which was
from March, 1844, to August, 1845), his opportunities for acquiring information
by external processes were but little if any more extensive than they had been
before. Mr. L. having for the previous part of his life been absorbed in the
respectable occupation of a tailor, had not been able to store his mind with that
scientific and philosophic knowledge which could have qualified him to impart
any important instruction to the young man. Nor did he even understand
many of the anatomical and medical technicalities which the clairvoyant would
frequently use in his examinations and prescriptions. Nor did Mr. L. possess
a library from which the young man could have derived any important aid in
developing his mind to the immense extent necessary to the composition of
-this book. Thus the Rev. Mr. Bartlett, in his letter above inserted, whose intimate acquaintance with Mr. Davis, according to his own statement, extended'from early in 1842 to 1845, says of the latter, in speaking of the first few months
(of his clairvoyance-career, " In his natural appearance, deportment, or oppor4unities, nq change was observable at this or any other period of my acquaintance with him."
Mr. Davis's connexion with Mr. Levingston continued for sonic eighteen'months, during the fore part of which period their associate labors were confined
-mostly to Pouglhkeepsie, but toward the latter part they made frequent excursions to Danbury and Bridgeport, Connecticut, in all of which places they hail
more or less patients. And wherever Davis went he was an object of intense'curiosity, and his movements were as a consequence closely observed, not only'while in his abnormal but while in his ordinary state. In each of those places,
therefore, he was well known by numerons persons; and no one among them
[has ever observed any reliable indication on his part of a studious habit: or it
they have, they will give forth, not their vague surmises, but the tangible facts
susceptible of proof, and so far our statement will be considered as refuted.
Indeed, the desultory life which he led during this period was very unfavorable to study, especially to that kind of study which could have afforded any
assistance in the production of the book now before the reader. When not:ravelling, he was on an average thrown into the abnormal state twice a day for

the purpose of attending to the diseased; and most of the time while in the
ordinary state, he spent in some light manual exercise, in walking, or in visiting his friends; and he spent little or no time in solitude.
The writer of this first became acquainted with Mr. Davis in July, 1844, being
at that time on a professional visit to Poughkeepsie. He was then nearly eighteen years of age, appeared to be of rather slender constitution, and exhibited
some of the marks of delicate health. We then had a long conversation with
him, during which he appeared very communicative, and unbosomed himself
with great simplicity; and from the thousand little indications incidentally
connected with his manner, pronunciation, use of language, the form and character of his thoughts, &c., we were irresistibly impressed that he was a young
man of very little school education, having almost no acquaintance with books,
and totally uninstructed in the arts and conventionalities of the world. His mind,
however, indicated a delicate susceptibility to impressions, and a capacity to
comprehend natural principles which we had witnessed in but few of his age.
Still his unique style of expression irresistibly proved that his own heart within,
and the invariable indications of Nature without, were almost the only books
which he had perused.
We also at the same time heard him examine a number of patients while in
the clairvoyant state. While in the latter state he appeared as if metamorphosed into a totally different being.  The human system seemed entirely
transparent to him, and to our utter astonishment he employed the technical
terms of anatomy, physiology, and materia medica, as familiarly as household
words! Our surprise was equally excited by the exceeding clearness with
which he described and reasoned upon the nature, origin, and progress of a disease, and concerning the appropriate means to employ for its removal. From
infallible indications presented, we saw that there could be no collusion or deception, and no such thing as receiving his impressions sympathetically from
the mind of the magnetizer. From that time we neither saw nor heard any
more of young Davis until the next May.
In February, 1845, Mr. Davis being (with his magnetizer) in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, attending to such patients as required his services, formed an acquaintance with Dr. S. S. LYON, the magnetizer connected with him during the
delivery of this book, and who was at that time a successful medical practitioner
in Bridgeport. Dr. Lyon had previously been an unbeliever in clairvoyance, but
the evidence of its truth, as presented in the case of young Davis, proved too
powerful for him to resist; and under a deep conviction of its importance, he
did not hesitate to render it his open encouragement, and to avail himself of
the clairvoyant's advice in the treatment of some difficult cases of disease then
under his charge.
In the following May, the writer of this happening to be at Bridgeport, accidentally fell in with Mr. Davis and Mr. Levingston, who were then at that
place on business connected with their occupation. During a most interesting
consultation which we then, in company with Rev. S. B. Brittan and several
other gentlemen, enjoyed with the clairvoyant,'in respect to various scientific
and spiritual subjects, we learned for the first time that he was soon to commence a series of lectures and revelations upon subjects such as are embraced
in this book. But not until about thirty hours previous to the commencement
of these lectures, as will hereafter be'}hown, -ad wTe the least anticipation of
being connected with him as his reporter.

XIV                       INTRODUCTION.
About the first of the following August, Mr. Davls, while in the clairvoyant
state, voluntarily chose Dr. Lyon to be his magnetizer during the delivery of
this book, this choice neither having been solicited nor in the least degree anticipated by Dr. L., until it was announced. In obedience to the direction of
the clairvoyant, Dr. Lyon immediately relinquished a remunerative and increasing practice in Bridgeport, and removed to New York, in which city the
clairvoyant decided that the revelations should be delivered. The object of so
early a removal to that city was, to establish, before the lectures commenced,
a medical practice that might in some measure assist in sustaining them while
said lectures were in progress.
During the three months which Mr. Davis spent in New York previously to
the commencement of this book, he was thrown into the abnormal state at an
average of twice a day, at least four hours of each day being thus consumed by
the duties of his occupation. Being, as usual, an object of great curiosity, he
received the calls of many persons who sought his acquaintance, both while in
the normal and abnormal state; and the intervals between his sittings for the
treatment of disease were known to be occupied chiefly in conversation, in
writing to his friends, in playing on his accordeon, or in walking; and all evidences conspired against the idea that he was habitually inclined to books.
He remained, then, up to the commencement of his lectures, the uneducated, unsophisticated child of Nature, entirely freefrom  the creeds, theories, and philosophies of the world: and up to this day, he has never been inclined to seek
ithe society of scientific men, but has rather avoided them. If the foregoing
somewhat circumstantial history of his life is untrue in any particular essentially involving the object for which it is here presented, it will, considering
the immense interests that are at stake, certainly be refuted; for we have thus
unreservedly laid open the subject to the investigation of the whole world.
On the 27th of November, 1845, residing at the time in New Haven, Connecticut, we received per mail a note from Dr. Lyon, stating that we had been
appointed by Mr. Davis, while in the clairvoyant state, as the scribe to report
and prepare for the press his lectures which were to commence immediately.
This appointment was entirely unsolicited (we will not say undesired) by ourself; and so far from anticipating such an honor, we were then busily engaged
in making arrangements to remove to Massachusetts. The next day, however,
we embarked for New York, and in the evening wrote Mr. Davis's first lecture at his dictation - subsequently agreeing to write and prepare the whole
for the press.
Before Mr. Davis commenced his lectures, he voluntarily, while in the abnormal state, chose the three witnesses mentioned in his address to the world,
to be present as their circumstances would allow, at the delivery of the lectures,
in order to be able to testify of the medium through which they were given.
Rev. J. N. Parker has since removed to Boston; Theron R. Laphamn resides at
present at Poughkeepsie, New York; and T. Lea Smith, M. D., is in Bermuda.
The twenty-three incidental witnesses mentioned in the note on page 2 of the
address to the world, are all still living, except James Victor Wilson, and he
has left his testimony behind.* Either of the living witnesses is open to con* A few days before this esteemed and highly-worthy young man departed to the
other world, he publ;shed an interesting pamphlet entitled "Magnetism and Clairvoyance explained, inculcated, and applied," in which he says, " The world will be

sultation; and each will testify to portions of the book being delivered in his
presence by Mr. Davis while under the influence of magnetism - to the original manuscripts of which portions (which are carefully preserved) they may
find their signatures attached.
The number of witnesses whose names are mentioned were deemed sufficient: if their testimony is not received, especially when it is ascertained that
they (or at least as many of them as we are familiarly acquainted with) are
men of irreproachable character, it is not probable that that of a thousand others
would share a fate essentially different.  During the delivery of each lecture
the clairvoyant required that the utmost tranquillity, both mental and physical,
should be preserved in the room. While in the sphere of the body (a phrase
hereafter to be explained), excitement of any kind always disturbed him, as did
also the presence of persons whose " spheres" were uncongenial.  Hence an
indiscriminate admittance of persons to the lectures would have been as impracticable as it was unnecessary. Yet such applicants as were actuated by a
supreme desire to know the truth irrespective of their previous opinions, were
generally admitted to a number ranging from one to six, whether they were believers or unbelievers in Clairvoyance, and such persons were always instaintly
distinguished by the lecturer while in his superior state.
Shortly after the lectures commenced, and several times during their progress, accounts were, in various journals, published of the same, and of the
nature of some of the developments, and investigation was invited from al]
persons who might feel disposed to inquire into the facts stated. Our rooms
when the clairvoyant was not lecturing, were freely accessible to all person;
from seven o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock in the evening, including
the hours of medical examinations. All questions were promptly and candidly
answered, and the clairvoyant's manuscripts were always open to the inspection of the curious; and if any responsible person, among the thousands who
called on us from all parts of the United States, during the fifteen months while
the book was in progress, discovered at any time the extensive tomes and par.
aphernalia of a profound student into the mysteries of the whole material and
spiritual Universe; or if Mr. Davis was ever discovered in the act of receiving
scientific or philosophical instruction from those capable of one half the range
of thought, and of consistent and consecutive argument displayed in this book,
shortly apprized of a triumph of Clairvoyance through the celebrated Mr. Davis,
which millions will be totally unprepared for. During the past year, this uneducated, unsophisticated, and amiable young man, has been delivering verbally, day by
day a comprehensive, well-planned, and extraordinary BooK —relating to all the
vast questions of the age, to the physical sciences, to Nature in all her infinite ramifications, to Man in his innumerable modes of existence, to GOD in the unfathomable
abysses of his Love, Power, and Wisdom. No human author, in any department of
literature or science, has ever electrified mankind to the degree that the eloquent yet
simple reasonings, the lofty and sublime disclosures, will, that constitute this great
compend of universal philosophy. Perhaps over four thqusand different persons who
have witnessed him in his medical examinations or in his scientific disclosures, live:o testify to the astonishing exaltation of mind possessed by Mr. Davis in his abnormal state. The two new planets of our system recently conjectured were described
in Davis's manuscripts fourteen months ago [March 15 and 16, 1846]. I have seen
him discoursing in a most angelic manner for more than four hours in succession."

he will of course make the same known to the world by proof on which the
public may rely, always being careful to distinguish properly between vague
imaginings and tangible fact. And if it is even admlitted that a youth of twenty
years, with five months' school tuition, and having been subjected throughout
his life to the most unfavorable circumstances, could, unknown to his most
intimate associates, have famaliarized his mind, by any external process, with
all important writings extant in all languages, upon the subject of cosmogony,
astronomy, geology, ethnology, archaeology, mythology, theology, psychology,
history, metaphysics, &c., &c., &c. - the wisdom with which gleanings have
been made from all these, the ability displayed in their classification, the bold
and familiar criticism displayed in reference to them all, and especially the
soaring flights of mind into regions not previously explored by any earthly
being, will constitute a phenomenon still demanding explanation.
The fact is, however, it is known to an absolute moral certainty to Mr. Davis's most intimate acquaintances, that he was, while in his normal state,
totally uninformed on all the great leading subjects treated in his book, until he
perused the manuscripts of his own lectures.
The question whether Mr. Davis may not have received much of the contentsof this book by sympathetic influx from the minds of those associated with him,
we would prefer to have discussed by others, if, indeed, such a question can
possibly occur. Suffice it say, that, for the best of reasons, we know that such a
thing could not be. Many facts, principles, and theories, are presented in this
volume which were before totally unconceived and unbelieved by either of Mr.
Davis's associates, especially on cosmological, theological, and spiritual subjects. One of Mr. Davis's associates, at least, has been truly pronounced as in
a merely " rudimental state" (see page 3 of the author's address to the world);
and the other we presume would have as little difficulty in proving that' his mind
has not been overburthened with knowledge upon the subjects herein discussed.
Should it be necessary, the evidence touching this point will be presented hereafter, though this may not be the most gratifying to the personal vanity of him
upon whom may devolve the task of setting it forth to the world.
If this law of sympathetic influx, however, is admitted, it should be duly
explained and defined before the conclusion is formed that it may not, under
favorable circumstances, be a medium through which spirits of the higher
world may transmit their knowledge to mankind on earth. Certainly the
sympathetic transmission of a thought from one person to another, while both
are in the body, is quite as inexplicable as would be the transmission of the
thoughts of a disembodied spirit to a person rendered duly susceptible to sympathetic influx. As touching this subject, however, see.the author's remarks on
Animal Magnetism, Clairvoyance, and the source of his impressions in the
forepart of this volume, in which the nature and ground of his claims are duly
set forth.
If the foregoing statements concerning Mr. Davis's past life, opportunities,
acquirements, &c., are correct, then it irresistibly follows that this book must
have been dictated by sote other and higher source of information than that
accessible to the physical senses. That source of information we claim to be
the SPIRITUAL WORLD. The evidence of this will be apparent on a perusal of
the whole volume, and especially of that portion of it which is comprised
between pages 33 and 57.

INTRODUCTION.                            XVll
We will now proceed to describe the process of the production of this book,
and the phenomena connected therewith: —
In the first place, the magnetizer and magpetizee are seated in easy positions facing each other. The ordinary manipulations are then performed, from
three to five minutes being required for the completion of the process. A sudden convulsion of the muscles, such as is produced by an electric shock, indicates that the subject is duly magnetized, immediately after which his eyes
are bandaged to protect them from the light. He then remains speechless for
some four or five minutes, and motionless, with the exception of an occasional
sudden convulsion of the muscles. One of these convulsions at length brings
him to a state of external consciousness, and gives him perfect command over
the muscles of the system and the organs of speech. He next assumes a position inclined either to the right or to the left, and becomes cold, rigid, motionless, and insensible to all external things. The pulsations become feeble, the
breathing is apparently almost suspended, and all the senses are closed entirely
to the external world. This condition, according to his own explanation, corresponds almost precisely to that of physical death. The faint vital forces still
remaining in his system, are only sustained sympathetically by the presence
of the magnetizer, whose system is by an ethereal medium blended and united
with his own. If while he is in this condition the magnetizer should by any
means lose connexion with him, the vital movements of the body would cease,
and the spirit would be incapable of re-entering it, as he himself has informed
us. In this respect he is different from any person we have ever seen while
under the magnetic influence. His mind is now entirely freed from the sphere
of the body, and, consequently, from all preconceived ideas, from all theological isms, and from all influences of education and local circumstances, and all
his impressions are received from the interior or spiritual world. His perceptions, conceptions, and reasoning powers, are now immeasurably expanded.
His spiritual sight, freed from its material obstructions, now extends to worlds
and systems innumerable, and he feels that he has almost ceased to be a member of the human family on earth, and is a member only of that great Family
of intelligent beings which inhabit universal space. He is thus elevated above
all the narrow, local, and sectarian prejudices that pervade the earth. His philosophy is only that which is involved in the laws and principles which control
the Universe and mankind unerringly, and his theology is only that which is
written on the wide-spread scroll of the heavens, in which every star is a
word, and every constellation a sentence. He associates familiarly with t] e
inhabitants of the spirit-world, and the diversified knowledge cultivated by
them is rendered accessible to his mind. The associated spirits and angels of
the " Second Sphere," are, as one grand Man, in sympathetic communication
with him to transmit knowledge to mankind on earth, which they perceive
the latte: are for the first time prepared to receive. Thus exalted, he gives
forth his mpressions of truth as it actually appears to him, without referenct
to any of the beliefs, philosophies, theories, or sectarian prejudices, that exist
in the world.
Having thus access to all the knowledge of the Second Sphere combined with
that of the first, such truths as are appropriate to communicate flow spontaneously into his mind, these being at the same time arranged according to a natural order of sequence. As soon as a distinct impression is thus received, the

spirit returns again to its material habitation, and employs the organs of
speech to communicate it to those present. A few words only are uttered at. time, which the clairvoyant requires to be repeated by Dr. Lyon, in order
that he may know that he is understood. A pause then ensues until what he
has said has been written, when he again proceeds; and the passage into and
out of the spiritual state occurs at an average of about once every sentence.
His diction is of the most direct and simple kind, and his ideas seem usually
to be clothed in those words which first present themselves. His phraseology
is not a subject of interior direction except when nice distinctions are to be
drawn and great precision of expression is required. His style is much such
as he would use in his normal state if a knowledge were imparted to him on
the subjects on which he treats while in his elevated condition. His grammar
is therefore defective; and although, when it is necessary in order to properly
embody an idea, he employs technical terms, and even foreign words and
phrases, with the greatest facility, he sometimes mispronounces, yet not in
such a way as to obscure his meaning. Correctness might have been attained
in. all these particulars, yet the labor on his part would in that case have been
immensely increased, by -making all those minutia matters of interior investigation. His great object was simply to present the idea, leaving the niceties
of the verbal clothing to be adjusted by myself, with the restriction that the
corrections should be such as not to destroy the peculiarities of the general
style and mode of expression.
His enunciation was characterized by a peculiar breathing solemnity as
though every word gushed from the depths of the soul; and his simple, pure,
and unaffected manner, was impressive in the extreme. If we were to say it
seemed that the very atmosphere of heaven surrounded him, and that angels
were continually breathing their thoughts through his organs of speech, the
expression would appear to be prompted by a heated enthusiasm; yet a phrase
less expressive would fail to convey an adequate idea. This remark applies
also to all his philosophical and spiritual conversations while in the abnormal
state.
The time occupied in the delivery of a lecture varied from forty minutes to
about four hours, and the quantity of matter delivered at a sitting varied from
three to fifteen pages of foolscap closely written. There were one hundred and
fifty-sev,en lectures in all, the first being delivered November 28, 1845, and the
last (viz., the "address to the world," which comes first in the book) was
delivered on the 25th of January, 1S47.
On closing the address to the world, the author immediately proceeded to
give general directions as to the corrections of the manuscripts, and the preparation of the work for the press. These directions (preserved in writing and
subscribed by a witness) I have scrupulously followed to the best of my ability.
NVith the exception of striking out a few sentences and supplying others, according to direction, I have only found it necessary to correct the grammar, to
prune out verbal redundancies, and to clarify such sentences as would to the
general reader appear obscure. All ideas have been most scrupulously preserved, and great care has been taken to give them to the reader in the precise
aspect in which they appeared when received from the speaker. We have,
also, conscientiously abstained from adding any ideas of our own. Also all
comparisons, and technical and foreign terms and phrases, and all peculiarities





## p. XIX (#23) #############################################


INTRODUCTION.                           XiL
of expression, are exclusively the speaker's.  When we havre found it necessary to reconstruct sentences, we have employed, as far as possible, only the
re-rbal materials found in the sentence as it first stood, preserving the peculiar-,ties of style and mode of expression. The arrangement of the work is the
same as when delivered, except that in three instances contiguous paragraphs
have been transposed for the sake of a closer connexion.  With these unimportant qualifications, the work may be considered as paragraph for paragraph,
sentence for sentence, and word for word, as it was delivered by the author.
The notes interspersed through the book, except that on page 593, were cornprsed by ourself.
Furthermore, the work was originally proposed by the clairvoyant him-'elf; the time oT its commencement was fixed upon by himself; and all
the instrumentalities connected with its production have constantly been
under his authoritative direction.  He has spoken only as directed by his
interior promptings, and no portions of his work have been elicited by the interrogatories or suggestions of another. When he has spoken he has spoken
spontaneously; and at such times as his interior perceptions were not duly
expanded, he has refused to proceed with his dictations. All persons around
him connected in any way with the production of the book, were therefore
moved by him; he was not in the least degree moved or influenced by any of
them; and it is owing solely to influences from the interior world as operating
on his mind, that the book now makes its appearance.
In connexion with the above, one fact may now be stated which must
appear to all reasoning minds as of powerful significance: Immediately after
giving general directions as to the correction and publication of the work, he
voluntarily, in the presence of a witness, and contrary to the expectation of
every one, renounced all claim, direct and indirect, to any portion of the copyright, and the proceeds of the sales of the work, simply claiming a reasonable
compensation for the time he had been employed in its delivery.
Concerning the character of the book we offer no remark further than what
is involved in the foregoing. It speaks for itself, and is its own interpreter.
We also abstain (for the present at least) from all defence of its contents, from
a profound conviction that these need no defence. It will be observed, however, that as the work advances from the commencemnent toward the close, the
style and diction gradually improve - which fact is to be explained by the law
of habit applicable to the mind in every condition in which it is capable of
being placed.
The question will perhaps occur to many minds, "' Is this work, professing,
as it does, to be a new revelation, to be considered as infallible?"  The answer
is involved in the teachings of the work itself: It recognises infallibility, in the
unrestricted sense of that term, as belonging to no being save the Deity hlimself.
If this or any other work embodied in human language should claim for itself
infallibility, the mind nevertheless would be unable to receive its teachings
only as the reasoning powers could digest and assimilate them; and this the
reason would do with more facility if no such claims were preferred. But the
noment any teachings, artificially expressed, are forced upon the mind under
the plea of infallibility, that moment Reason and Nature are thrown aside, and
the standard of belief becomes entirely arbitrary. Belief in this case is nothing
more than superstition; and those who are sufficiently frank and dignified to

avow a rejection of the " infallible standard" from the incoherence of its teach.
ings with the dictates of enlightened reason, are subjected to the indignation of
"the faithful" who demand unconditional credence in that which they suppose
to be of more authority than all reason and natural consistency, and which, if
the mind receives, it can not either comprehend or practically apply. Thus'lave arisen all the superstition, bigotry, and sectarian hostility, that ever have
cursed the human race; and it is impossible that the Deity could ever have
designed the establishment of an "infallible standard" that could tend to such
results.
Pleader, do not consider this book as a standard so infallible as to relieve you
from the exercise of your own reason. Remember that although it is the production of a mind immensely exalted, and having access to the knowledge of a
higher world, it is still the production of a human mind; and if the work will
not stand upon its own intrinsic merits, let it be rejected. If, however, its
contents on due investigation commend themselves to the approbation of your
interior being, let them be considered as true, even infallibly so, at least until
they are proved otherwise. And in this connexion we may remark that the
work, as to all its essential principles, is the product of great care on the part
of its author. At each entrance into the abnormal state for the purpose of lecturing, he was capable, by an effort of a few moments' duration, of reviewing
all the manuscripts of his previous lectures. Hence it is not probable that any
serious error would have long escaped detection, had such, through inadvertence, been even liable to occur. And to this, again, it may be added that the
clairvoyant never lectured when from physiological causes or surrounding circumstances he was rendered incapable of that perfect disconnexion from the
darkening influences of the material world, which was necessary to the full
development of his mental susceptibilities. Inasmuch, however, as the author
establishes the principle that "particulars and minutiae can not be depended
upon as connected with any great general principle," it can scarcely be expected that the many particulars and ininutiae involved in this work of eight hundried pages are in every individual case nicely accurate. But whatever inaccuracies of this kind, apparent or real, may be discovered (and the real ones
will be few if any), these can not have any effect upon the great general principles and truths which it is the only aim of this work to establish, and on
which alone it must stand or fall.
This book is not put forth to the world without a definite conception of the
obstacles it will have to contend with, and the influences that will be favorable to the general dissemination of its principles. There are three general
classes of minds to which it makes its appeal. The first of these consists of
those who are strongly attached to hereditary customs and modes of thought,
and who are averse to the unfolding of any truths in the departments of science
and theology which conflict with that which they have been taught to believe
and cherish as sacred. These will oppose this work, not by dignified and
manly argumentation, giving a fair and candid representation of its contents,
but by the most unqualified denunciation, and calling it all kinds of opprobrious
names; by representing it as most revolting in its teachings and dangerous in
its tendencies, and cautioning all minds to abstain from reading it, lest they be
led astray; by seeking to throw contempt and distrust upon the source from
which it came; and by raising the cry throughout the land, " Great is Diana

of the EDliesians!"  But the truthfulness of the author's motto can not but be
apparent to every reflecting mind, that "Any theory, hypothesis, philosophy,
sect, creed, or institution, that fears investigation, openly manifests its own
error."  Twenty years ago, the obstructing influence of this class of minds
would have been effectual, and hence this work was not at that time given.
gut now a different state of things has obtained. New truth is now beginning
to be regarded as more sacred than old error; and hereditary impression, which
has from the infancy of the race led almost all the world astray, is beginning
to be abandoned as an unstable foundation. Everything betokens the approach'f a mighty revolution in the affairs of the social and religious world; and the
influence. of old and venerated customs and forms of thought, in obstructing the
progress of any truthful principles that may be embodied in this work, call last
but for a day.
The second class of minds to which this work makes its appeal consists of
those who have no decided affection either for any established customs, existing institutions, or prevailing modes of faith, but are willing to become the
servants or opposers of any as their social or financial interests may dictate.
Many among these, being moved by the popular current, will peruse this volume, not for the purpose of truly understanding its teachings, and adopting
them  so far as true, but for the purpose of criticising,, reviewing, and obstructing its influence. Such will distort passages from their proper connexion, force upon them a meaning which the author did not intend, and thus
hold up the work to the ridicule and execration of the world. But as minds
of this class have no fixed principles, truth has nothing permanently to fear
from their influence, though they may succeed in slightly obstructing its progress for a season.
The third class consists of those who are governed by the supreme love of
truth and the practical results to which it leads. Such neither favor nor oppose
an~y institution, creed, or philosophy, either because it is old or new.  They
consider everything according to its own intrinsic merits, irrespective of all
collateral circumstances attending., They are open to conviction from all
sources, but will neither receive nor reject a thing unexamined. They are
upon the broad ocean of universal investigation, content to be moved only by
the winds and tides of evidence, confiding in the efficacy of these to waft them
to the haven of some grand system of truth and righteousness based upon the
nature of things and universally applicable. Thousands of such minds are now
already in the field of action, and their number is daily increasing; and there
are tens of thousands naturally belonging to this class among all parties, sects,
and denominations, throughout the land. Such are the minds -which are ascending the throne of the world, and by these all inferior classes must be directed and elevated. To such this book more particularly addresses itself; and
from such the utmost fairness may be expected in the investigation of its contents. From such, therefore, the work, if true, has nothing to fear, but everything to hope.
With the foregoing statements and remarks this book is submitted to the
world with the utmost confidence that it is all it professes to be, and with
the most entire reliance upon its intrinsic power to accomplish its proposed
work. For its pure and elevated morality, fbr its hign and holy principles,
for its unspeakably sublime and consoling truths, we are willing, if absolu,

AN ADDRESS TO THE WORLD.
BRETHREN: Fear not, for Error is mortal and can not live, and
Truth is immortal and can not die! Duty demands serious analysis
and investigation of all conspicuous subjects. Truth may be found
in the following Revelation: if so, Nature must be the standard by
which all men may judge whether the truths therein contained are
pure, practical, and elevating. No arbitrary or external standard
shall be recognised as suitable to test the truth of what is herein presented, or the ctiaractcr of the truths which may be herein contained.
The verdict of Nature, and not of men, is required.  Inasmuch as:
all terrestrial creations are the spontaneous productions of the Divine
mind, no truth is lessened by disbelief-no error is made true because the learned receive it as such.  Nothing can be changed' that
is unchangeable, by man or his actions.  Then press onward! Exercise your choicest gift, which is Reason —and fear no corruption
from truth, though new; and expect no good from error, though long
believed.
I have been impressed to speak the things contained in the following pages, not because truth was before undiscovered, but in
order to give it a new and attractive form, and a power to instruct,
purify, and elevate the race.
The FIRST PART, or KEY, presents a general view of theoriezs
that exist, and unfolds the foundation of the philosophy that is presented in the SECOND PART, which is the soul or basis of the whole
superstructure. The THIRD PART, or APPLTCATION, consists of ali
analysis of human society, and an application of previously-revealed'
principles to it, in order that a reformation like unto a new heavenr
and a new earth may legitimately flow therefrom.
The physical and mental organization of man enforces the concliUsion that there are no possible limits to social progress and spiritual'
attainment and elevation: for man is a mimcrocsrwm, or, ai comhin(wi

expression of all the perfections contained in the Divine essence that
animates and preserves the harmony of the Universe. Upon the
constitution of man, who is a type of Divine wisdom, are based those
important principles which, when duly comprehended, will construct
of the whole world one Brotherhood.
Moreover, I was impressed to select THREE AWITNESSES, who
should be present at the lectures, so that the world through  them
might know from what source these revelations flow.*   The number
corresponds to a trinity, everywhere manifested in Nature and her
productions; and was fixed upon for the purpose of having as many
specific degrees of perception and qualification. And also a SCRIBE
was necessary to preserve these sayings, and to prepare and present
them to the general mind.  And it was impossible, without a qualified MANIPULATOR, to enter the sphere of wisdom which was necessary to enable me to relate these things.
The first witness chosen was Rev. J. N. PARKErR, whose physi-,cal and mental structure predisposed him to external observation and
investigation.  He was inclined to perceive and understand the nature:and qualities of all exterior movements —had the ability to comprebhend the things related-but was inclined to outward and general
Besides the witnesses specially chosen, the following persons have witnessed:respectively a greater or less number of the lectures:-'Israel Kinsman,   New York.          Joseph Haight, New York.

James Taylor,      "    "             Hervey K. Haight, Bridgeport, Conn.
William L. Burdict,"    "
There were one hundred and fifty-seven lectures in all. To the orlginal pencilled
tmanuscripts of one hundred and forty of these, I find attached two hundred and:sixty-seven signatures as witnesses —one or more of the names of the above
persons, including the witnesses specially chosen, being subscribed to each lecture.'The number of lectures witnessed by any one individual, ranges from one to seventy-,three. There is here and there a lecture (amounting to seventeen in all) which.does not contain any signature as a witness; but the identity of the source of these
with that of the others will not be doubted by any one on proper investigation.
A few persons, not named above, were present at particular lectures; but as their,names do not appear upon the documents, it is unnecessary to mention them.

observation.  Therefore he was qualified to take cognizance of each
physical phenomenon-and thus corresponds to the principle of
LOVE, which the sequel will define.
The second witness chosen was THERON R. LAPHAM, who is physically and mentally qualified to perceive external manifestations, and to
enter deeply into the interior of the subjects revealed.  He is naturally inclined to critical investigation of the various subjects tending
to unfold the mind and elevate the race.  He is qualified, by a combination of experiences, to comprehend the truth and practicability
of each subject familiarly treated upon. He can feel the applicability
of these principles to society, being personally conscious of their
truth, and naturally though silently desirous of beholding their perfect work.  Therefore he was chosen because he corresponds to the
principle of WILL, or exLcclttie power, which also the sequel will define.
The third witness chosen was Dr. T. LEA SMITH, who was in a
transition state between the artificial doctrines and philosophies of
the world, and those high and more important truths which Mlind
only is capable of perceiving and associating with.  He is naturally
inclined to interior meditation, and qualified to feel the force of any
high and interior truth when presented to his mind. He is inclined
to spiritual association, displaying at all times a purity of intention
and earnestness of devotion.  Therefore he corresponds to the principle of wISDOM, which also the sequel will unfold.
The scRIBE who was chosen is WILLIAM FISIHBOUGH, who is
physically and mentally constituted so as to preserve a harmony and
dignity of outer, and a purity and goodness in his inner being. He
is by nature inclined to associate with those high and elevating truths,
a knowledge of which proceeds from the sublime manifestations of
Nature and the Divine mind.  He has an interior desire to search
and comprehend all useful natural and spiritual truths.  Iie is mentally disposed to seek the higher spheres, and to repose confidence
in their unfailing revealments.  He is generally qualified to preserve
a harmony in the movements of natural life, and a purity in respect
to the teachings of divine things; and he has a sense of justice not
to be purchased by natural interests.  Hence he is chosen to act in
this capacity, because he corresponds to LOVE, WILL, and WISDOM,
combined.  Though these are still in a rudimental state, yet they
are sufficiently developed to produce their natural results, the nature
of which the sequel will describe.
The MANIPULATOR, Dr. SILAS SMITHII LYON, is physically con

stituted so as to be able to impart a congenial influence to the system
of the speaker, whereby the transition of the natural faculties to the
spiritual sphere has been accomplished.  He is mentally inclined
to perceive and comprehend elevating principles, and to apply them
to his life and general actions. He is earnestly engaged at all times
in doing what those principles demand, desiring justice and a general
good to all; and he is thus mentally qualified to understand all spiritual truths which are the subjects of interior meditation. Hence
he is naturally opposed to all dissimulation, and will present those
things which form a part of his mind, not in speech, but in general
deportment and action.  Therefore I was impressed to seek this
outer association as the primary means of assisting the mind to obtain
and reveal these things.
Being thus situated, surrounded by witnesses earnest, desirous,
and qualified to receive the truth; a scribe spiritually absorbed in the
things related; and a manipulator to govern the action in delivering
these things, I have been impressed without obstruction to present
these disclosures.
Of the physical and mental structure of the speaker, the world will
know by a different process —one which will be suggested to the
scribe, by whom all useful information concerning these things will
be presented to the world.
Such, brethren, were the cxternal means by and through which
this book has made its appearance.. Your duty is to search; and
after searching, ask Nature and your own superior judgments how
much practical truth there is herein revealed. In doing this, you
will display the dignity of your natures, perform your highest duty,
receive the most unbounded interior approbation, and obtain MENTAL.

PART I.
THE KEY,
OR
THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
~ 1. REASON is a principle belonging to man alone. The office
of the mind is to investigate, search. and explore, the principles of
Nature, and trace physical manifestations in their many and varied
ramifications.  Thought, in its proper nature, is uncontrolled-un-'imited. It is free to investigate, and to rise into lofty aspirations.
And the only hope for the amelioration of the world is free thought
and unrestricted inquiry. Anything which opposes or tends to obstruct this sublime and lofty principle, is wrong.
The mind can not be chained! It will leave its resting-place,
and explore the fields of science; and, not satisfied with the investigation of terrestrial things, it has soared to the heavens and counted
the stars.  It has familiarized itself with the motions of the planet:;,
given namles to laws that control the universe, and has proved the
existence and qualities of these laws by mathematical analysis and
demonstration. The mind is naturally unrestrained in its actions
and thoughts-free from all shackles and bonds of the external
world. Yet man has not been allowed to express sentiments irresistibly flowing into his mind. Ignorance, superstition, and bigotry,
have wielded a tyrannical sceptre, and sectarianism has usurped the
dominion over the human soul!
AMan has rights founded in principles of Nature. These rights
have been perverted, crushed, and prostrated.  Folly has reigned in

the place of reason; imbecility has reigned instead of thought; vice
has reigned instead of virtue; ignorance has reigned instead of knowledge, and bigotry has reigned instead of benevolence! Thus the
highest, holiest and sublimest powers of man have been repressed
and distorted by the degrading shackles of superstition and false
imaagination.
The office of the mind is to hold dominion where the above
evils have reigned.  It is to become unchained and free from the
prison of sectarian darkness, and ushered into the light of truth and
the atmosphere of liberty. The tall monuments of ignorance which
have existed, may be interrogated by generations yet unborn.
Man has not been permitted to enjoy the free and uncontrolled
exercise of his powers and intellectual endowments. He has not had
the liberty to express thoughts gushing from the depths of his mind,
but has been compelled to restrain and repress them for want of an
atmosphere of light and liberty. The few who have dared to express themselves freely, have done it at the immediate risk of their
physical destruction.  Truths that are eternal have been conceived
of, yet smothered by the hand of a dominant and tyrannical Ignorance.
This ignorance still exists; this bigotry and superstition still exist;
and where is the responsibility for the caulse of their existence?
Sectarian usurpation must bear the charge.  It has, in its long career,
crushed and prohibited the free exercise of moral and intellectual
attainment.  It has obstructed the progress of human knowledge.
It has obscured the main features and manifestations of truth, and
thrown a mantle of ignorance and fanaticism over the world. It has
covered and concealed from the mind of man the real and only principle which constitutes his peculiar dignity. It has sapped the foundations of human happiness. It has produced a schism in the race,
and a wasting prostitution of human powers yet uncorrected and uncontrolled.. The true interests of mankind have thus been perverted
to those of vice and misery.  Wisdom  has not existed, but folly
has usurped her throne. Knowledge has been limited, while ignorance has been universal. Happiness has been crushed to the
ground, while misery has everywhere raised her hideous head. Persecution, incited and sustained by ignorance and party prejudice,
has destroyed thousands of human beings. The mind of man has
thus become enslaved, and no principle or power of truth and virtue
has been able to break its chains!

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                    7
Deplorable have been the results of ignorance and vice.  With a
ruthless hand they have grasped and held the interests, affections,
and mental associations of men, until the voice of Nature had nc
power to speak and tell of the victim's fate! Thus most melancholy has been the condition of generations past.  The cause is
vividly reflected on our minds; and the reflection induces the conclusion that such conditions shall not again exist. Reflection on
things past and present show to the inquiring mind that the iitstitutiotns which have existed have been in direct opposition to the interests, feelings, and affections, of human nature.  Those institutions
can not exist to the extent to which they have, because the mind of
man has become nearly unshackled, and free to act and investigate,
and boldly to express its earnest and serious convictions. And
these investigations will remove the foundations of illiberal institutions, which are based upon impure motive, and not on true principle - which are sustained by motives of individual interest, and
not by the interest and good of mankind.
The world is existing on wrong foundations.  The interests of one
person are in direct opposition to the interests of another; and what
is one man's interest results in another's misfortune.  The interests
of individuals are centred in their isolated and distinctive principles
and pursuits; and the corrupt condition of society and the world is
owing to the great amount of individual absorption from the common
rights of humanity. It is from this cause that the world, instead of
harmonizing in all its parts and ramifications, is in a disorganized
state; and, from the fact that each part is obstructed in so many
ways from communicating and harmonizing with others, the whole
has become disunited and confused.
As the world is situated, those elements that are united become
absorbents from those which are not; and hence, instead of an harmoniously-organized condition of the world, one part is extraneous
and excrescent to another. Hence, instead of being united, the
world is disunited; and instead of harmonizing, it is confused.  Instead of universal peace and good-will, war and devastation have
prevailed; and instead of the happiness and interests of one man
consisting in the happiness and interests of the whole, the interests
of each one are in direct opposition to the interests of others.  This
can not and shall not much longer exist. Its causes are becoming
revealed; and this revelation arouses the feelings, interests, and
crushed affections of man, to one vast rebellion against the domin

ions of vice and misery.  Truth, in her mighty power, shall prevail
over ignorance; and all her enemies shall be crushed, to rise no
more! One principle, one foundation, one faith, one interest, one
universal and eternal asylum, shall exist for the whole world of mankind! -This result rises above the utmost conceptions of the mind;
and this will usher in that light which has been hid so long from the
world. This light is happiness and peace; and this, too, is the light
which, when once it expands, can not contract.  And this is the
resurrection from moral and intellectual degradation!
~ 2. The general principles of Nature and of human rights deinand this amelioration.  Interests in the form of sectarian desires
have prostrated the energies of the freeborn mind, and the moral
principles have become enslaved and imprisoned in the darkness of
fanaticism that has covered the intellects of men.  Not only have the
true principles of the nature of man become obscured and vague, but
their legitimate workings and manifestations have been misrepresented.
Dispositions, feelings, and affections, which man never possessed,
have been thought to compose his nature; and this mistaken idea
rias led to the conclusion that man can hold situations which are in
direct opposition to his interests.
But he is immorally situated, whose interest tells him one thing,
while his conscience and duty tell him another. He is immorally
situated, whose interest it is to withhold knowledge, when his reasonl
tells him that the same should be extensively disseminated. He is
immorally situated who is obliged to withhold from the world his
feelings and affections, and to suppress the general principles of his
nature, in order to preserve his individual interests.  It is thus that
the true principles of man's nature, and the true source of human
happiness, are concealed; and when there is a correct manifestation
of these, it passes away before the eyes of the world as a mere apparition, and appears fleeting and evanescent as the thoughts of the
last generation.
Circumstances are thought irresistibly to control the world, both
collectively and individually; and, under this impression, man has
consented to be controlled by them. But man holds the power to destroy those circumstances which are unfavorable to his happiness
and peace; and by exercising this power, he will sustain and cooperate with the principles of Nature.  These fleeting circumstances
being destroyed, man will be controlled only by the operations of

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  9
general law. This, however, has not yet been done, because man
individually can not do it.
No one principle of government, unvarying in its nature, could be
made to manifest its proper results, as applied to an isolated and detached community. Those who have founded, and put forth efforts
to sustain, communities, have been persons who have striven to familiarize the laws, which governed them, to their feelings and affections.  The condition of society and of the world has become repulsive to their feelings and sentiments; and their movements are but
the outbreaking and gushing forth of those desires that have been so
long concealed.
A knowledge of'the natural laws which govern society should have
been before understood; but the sources of knowledge which exist
in the world have been perverted from their legitimate object and
use. Institutions for the diffusion of knowledge are founded on an
artificial basis. It is the interest of every institution to confine its
knowledge to itself; whereas, it should be both the principle and
interest of all such to cause their knowledge to become universal.
Moreover, people who have not the capacity to comprehend the sciences, should not be educated for, and compelled to hold situations,
where such knowledge is absolutely required.
The situations of professional men are exceedingly corrupting and
vitiating.  Those who would be honest, con 7not; for their interests
oppose. The condition of these and of other members of society at
this time, is an artificial representation of the circumstances by which
the world is controlled.  Generations that are past have neglected
the great light of the knowledge of these truths. Their time and
talents were engaged in the upbuilding of sectarian and denominational casts; and in protecting these, nations have warred against
nations. Destruction and devastation were the legitimate results;
and, neglecting the general and personal good, man lost his happiness
by these inhuman proceedings. No man could utter a thought, or
express himself in any respect, contrary to the prevailing sentiment.
This vice, misery, illiberality, and uncharitableness, with all their
legitimate moral and intellectual results, still exist;'and man has lost
much of the light and knowledge which he would now possess, if the
real had existed in place of the artificial.
Free and unrestrained inquiry is necessary to moral and intellectual
progress, and therefore should be encouraged.  Truth is an eternal
principle; and any institution, creed, denomination, or any influence

of a sectarian character, that opposes in any way the free and unrestrained investigation of truth, must evidently be founded on ignorance, superstition, and bigotry.  And, moreover, anything which
tends to restrict the spirit of inquiry, openly manifests its own error.
Every principle opposed to free and unrestrained investigation shows.distinctly the fear of light and knowledge. Light upon any subject
of a moral nature should be received free from interests or local prejudices; and if free investigation or the most unlimited exercise of
the human mind, is obstructed, the obstruction proclaims its author's
own condemnation: for this is the condemnation, that light is come
into the world, and men choose the darkness of bygone ages, and
foster it, rather than light, because their institutions and actions arce
cvil.
Appeal is now made to the feelings, desires, and the understanding: Is it consistent with the natural promptings of true moral principle that the interests of mankind should be distinct and conflicting,
or that man's interests should be in direct opposition to his sense of
justice and right?  Is it right that man should suppress thought,
rather than let it have its free course?  Is it right that man should
mistake things that exist for things which do not exist?  Is it right
that man should be so situated as that his interest must conflict with
his duty?  Is it right that sectarian usurpation should hold the sway
over the mind of man, rather than that man should be allowed to
reason understandingly?  Is it right that the morals of man should
be supplanted by the prevalence of vice and misery? Is it right that
one idea should constitute the scope of the minds of any class or
community, rather than free, universal thought and action?  Is it
right that truth and its results should be crushed and subdued by
error?  Is it right that happiness and peace should be expelled from
the world, to give place to wretchedness and imperfection? Is it
right that the free and unpolluted atmosphere of light, truth, and liberty, should be contaminated by the impure elements of ignorance
and folly? Language is inadequate to set forth the importance of
these questions and their answers!
Association, when based upon true and natural principles, is
proper and highly advantageous; but when perverted and arbitrarily
formed, it is exceedingly evil and vitiating. It is the nature of man
to seek an association, wherein he may breathe an atmosphere of light
and liberty; and it is his nature to appreciate the associations which

he forms from the spontaneous impulses of his affections and inclinations.  But though it is natural for man to form attachments, these,
in order to be genuine, must be governed altogether by his internal
sensibilities and affections.  The sphere of one man can approach
that of another only in accordance with the laws of a natural congeniality; and impressions upon the man internal, though received
through the senses, are governed and sanctioned by one universal
law of Nature. For man possesses a visible form, which serves as a
mediuml through which he associates with things invisible and eternal.
Thus man has the power to comprehend and analyze the important features of truth, which is invisible and eternal; and if he had
rightly used this power, he would not feel that he is existing among
uncontrollable and foreordained circumstances, but would display his
true nature and dignity by investigating and removing the causes of
which these circumstanccs are the (ffects: and if these causes were
removed, the effects themselves would cease.  But a protective
policy has prevailed throughout the world, destroying the power and
disposition to change these circumstances.  The cause of these has
been universal ignorance; and man can change this cause only by
becomingf Jfee and intelligent.
~ 3. Inasmuch as man is governed by intcrcst, this is in reality
his principle; and the general object to be aimed at is to change his
interests to the interests of the whole.  He should feel that what is
his good, is the good of all; and that what governs and controls his
actions, should control and govern the actions of the world; and that
what constitutes his happiness and peace, should constitute the happiness and peace of all mankind. He should feel that what it is his
interest to explore and investigate, should in like manner be related
to the interests of all; and he should feel that what contributes to his
comfort and improvement, should administer to the comfort and improvement of the race. And he should feel that the highest and
only good of his own nature comports with, and is conducive to, the
highest and only good of all his species.  This principle will be
recognised; but not until the shackles of sectarian usurpation are
stricken off, and the mind of man becomes free to think, express,
and act out, what he and the whole world receives with approbation.
Then will man manifest his true nature and dignity, and then will he
manifest his intrinsic worth. Then will he be actuated by the great
moral principles which were designed to govern his being.  Thee

will be made perfect the beauty of virtue; then will man be governed by the immutable laws of kindness and affection; and then he
will be man, in the highest and holiest acceptation of that term.
Then righteousness, justice, and equity, will be the inevitable characteristics of his thoughts and actions. Then patience, perseverance,
and the guidance of his mental nature, will be manifested in all his
moral and intellectual enterprises. Man has the promise that all
these results shall be attained. The sun of moral light will dawn
through the clouds of his past history; and, by the aid of past experience, light, warmth, and virtue, shall be spread with universal
diffusion!
But it is necessary to set forth to view more distinctly the vice
and misery which have been experienced in generations past; for
experience is the only true monitor, which, by reminding men of
former errors, may lead them into the paths of right. And it is
man's province to learn by experience dearly bought, and by errors
past detected by him, to practise righteousness.
Institutions which have been founded upon the artificial demands
of a dominant ignorance, cast at this time a mantle over the world
which prevents unrestrained and free inquiry. To defend these institutions, man has been forced, against his nature and duty, and to
the entire sacrifice of justice, his feelings, and his conscience, to take
the sword against his brother. War, persecution, vice, and misery,
have thus reigned.  The moral, social, and intellectual nature of
man, has been thus crushed and prostrated! Mohammedanism has
wielded her tyrannical sceptre, and in her career she has crushed
thousands to the earth. The sympathetic tear, and the gushing
affections and feelings of man, have been repressed in the madness
of fanaticism, thought to be religion.  Man at that time was not man
in his feelings, desires, or actions; as the distinctive characteristics
of his nature were smothered by the inexorable hand of persecution
and distress. Legislation was at that time unrestricted by any principle of human rights. The social principles were no longer cared
for by those who founded institutions. Thoughtlessly and fearlessly
was this high-handed destruction of the morals and peace of the
world carried on. Man at that time was oppressed by all temporal
and external power, and was not at liberty to express even a desire
to be free from his degraded condition. His moral, intellectual,
civil, and social rights, were completely prostrated.  His utmost

energies were inadequate to produce a revolution in the condition of
mankind.  A reorganization, such as would give scope to his powers and faculties, was impossible. A restitution of his crushed rights
was even beyond his conceptions; for his mind was not free to expand, if it would, or even to hope for a resurrection. Inquisitorial
institutions, without control or restriction, spread over the nations
like a great flood; and at that time, as is yet the case, the mind was
not free to think and to reveal its inward convictions. No principle
of justice or of nature was any longer recognised as a propelling
power to prompt man in his actions. These were all perverted, and
man was forced to stand at the stake, where, amid the burning flames,
the instinctive principles of his nature would gush forth, and he would
stand unmoved and unchanged! But the world has not been so
vitiated as to destroy the principles of some noble characters which
have lived.
Men have become degraded, not only from darkness and ignorance, but they have become still more degraded and depressed by
the martyrdom  of their physical and mental natures.  Many have
passed the fiery trials which ignorance, and vice, and inquisitions,
could subject them to, and have suffered not only the loss of their
physical and mental freedom, but have sacrificed their very lives.
All this mental slavery is caused by a perversion of man's natural
inclinations, and of the principles of Nature.
And there are beings now existing as perfect as any others in size,
symmetry, and physiological structure; governed by the same feelings, affections, and natural associations; manifesting the same instinctive and genuine affections and desires for their physical freedom
-beings who form a part of mankind, though they are not quite the
same as others in their external complexions-and over these you
have assumed a control which it is not your office to exercise. And
by an abandonment of all sense' of justice and righteousness, you have
enslaved these, and thus held a part of your own species in physical
and legal servitude! The mental slavery of generations past bears
a resemblance to the physical slavery of the present.
The only hope for the physical and mental amelioration of mankind, is based upon a slow but steady mental progress; and this must
be the result of a steady, patient, but firm and decided investigation
of the causes of the existence of present evils. And the experience
of the errors of ages past will serve as a monitor for our future proceedings.

14               THIE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
The condition of society at this time prevents the exercise of true
moral principles, and the justness of human action. It is the object
and interest of institutions to keep knowledge confined within their
own limits, and to withhold what little they may possess from the
general mind; for if knowledge were universal, these institutions
would be useless. Professional men also feel it their interest to
withhold knowledge relating to their distinct spheres of pursuit.
The physician feels it his interest to have but little knowledge prevail concerning the physiological and anatomical structure of the
human system: for if the knowledge of this and of the law which
controls physical organization were generally diffused in the world,
each person would know the result of organic violation, and would
avoid it.  And men would be morally as well as intellectually informed; and hence they would not only prevent disease, but would
individually abstain from violating the laws of society. And in proportion as the knowledge of this science exists in the community or
the world, man's individual interests become absorbed in the general
good.  The physician therefore feels that his interest consists in the
amount of ignorance, vice, and consequent disease. As a physician,
he will tell you so; as a man, he will utterly disapprove and abhor
this state of things. Similar in this respect is the situation of every
man in society.
Another vice may be mentioned: The distiller's interest consists in
the amount of inebriacy that prevails in the world; and the degradation of man through ignorance, adds to his profits by promoting unrestrained indulgence in beastly gratifications.  HIence intemperance
has prevailed to an alarming extent.  And this state of things, too,
is sanctioned by the highest civil laws of states and nations; and each
legislative body has given its approval, while its best feelings, sense
of justice, and consciousness of duty, -abhorred the act.
~ 4. Society is thus existing on wrong foundations-is based upon
a mistake and misconception of the real principle which actuates man.
It seeks isolated rather than the general good; and a destruction of
the morals and peace of society and the world has followed.
Is there, then, liberty for the unrestricted exercise of thought and
expression? Is man irrecoverably lost to his true nature, in the circumstances and condition of things which have placed him where he
is? Is there any one who would oppose the free investigation of
the principles which govern his being?  And is there a being in the

world who would not readily apply all his mental force and energy
to produce a revolution and reorganization of society? And instead
of society and the world existing in a disunited and disorganized
state, depending wholly upon external circumstances, and being subjected to the immediate rule of artificial laws, would it not be better
to understand and recognise the law that controls Nature and man
with an undeviating and unchangeable government?  Would it not
be better to have those laws understood whose results can at all times
be depended upon, so that, in accordance with their demands, the
whole actions and interests of mankind may be made generally reciprocal, and each individual interest to harmonize with the interest
and happiness of the race?  Would it not, we repeat, be best to
have the world exist upon these immutable laws?  Then existence
would be emblematical of the brightness and beauty of Eden! Then
that great Tree which has been so long concealed from the mental
view, but whose roots have existed eternally, founded only in that
great system of Nature of which we are the subjects and the effects,
would grow and progress in glory, beauty, and perfection. It would
assume the true form and display the ennobling qualities legitimately
belonging to its nature. It would branch, bud, and bloom, in beauty,
and its fruits would be the united interests of mankind.  It would
diffuse the fragrance of a general benevolence, brotherly kindness,
and charity. Its branches would wave over the world, and generations yet unborn would repose in its invigorating shade.  Such would
be the delicious fruits of the great Tree of KNOWLEDGE!
Its opposite has existed.  It has been permitted to grow upon the
mistaken and misdirected minds of men, and upon su/2posed principles, such as never did compose the nature of mankind. Upon all
these superficialities has been permitted to germinate the roots of the
tree of evil. And now understanding the foundation on which this
tree is permitted to grow, it becomes your duty, your interest, your
highest and greatest good, to undermine and overthrow it; and then
to establish mankind, both socially and mentally, in the various natural spheres and organizations of existence. And then will be seen
towering above, and completely transcending the highest conceptions
of man, that great tree whose foundation is in Nature, and whose
growth depends upon the fertility of your minds and just actions.
And its legitimate effect will be to send through the world one universal fragrance of affection, which will bind the interests, feelings, and
associations of men, in one united mass; and the race will be perfect,

even as was its representative, the man Adam! Then this earth
will be one grand and universal garden, the true Eden of existence
and then, too, will mankind, as one nation, be like their representative, standing perfect. in this garden, without spot or blemish. And
then this great Tree, whose growth has been so long depressed and
retarded, will germinate and spread its branches over the nations of
the world, whose interest will be one interest; whose morals will be
one vast and universal stream of light and righteousness.  All parts
will be joined to compose one vast harmonious whole; and then wil
be the true millcnliumn!  Then, too, will the united voices of each
succeeding generation repeat that grand and holy exclamation which
is now smothered, yet unrepealed —" Peace on earth, good will to
men!"
These prophetic thoughts are not merely the result of a heated
imagination; but they are conclusions arrived at by direct appeals to
cause and effect-inductions drawn from a comparison of past and
present generations. A synopsis of this reasoning is as follows:
Truth is a positive principle: Error is a negative principle; and as
truth is positive and eternal, it must subdue error, which is only
temporal and artificial. And as knowledge is a direct and everunchangeable result of Truth, it must overpower and subdue its opposite-ignorance, superstition, vice, and misery.  The first is eternal;
the second is temporal. One is founded on the unchangeable laws
that control the Universe and all organic beings, and the other is
founded on the misdirected, crushed, and perverted understanding.
And as that which is eternal must and does prevail, that which is
temporal and terrestrial can not prevail: and Truth will gain the ascendency. Ignorance, which has been, and still appears to be, inexorable in its influences, must be destroyed by the annihilating hand
of Truth and Wisdom, which are omnipotent.
Man, who has now approached to some degree of knowledge,
feels sustained by surrounding beings who wonder at his indulgence.
He becomes lofty, dignified, and vain.  He assumes a spirit of arrogance, and with an air of pomposity takes the stand of a foolish critic.
He will complain of the great laws which compose and govern the
Universe, and dare to suggest alterations and improvements in their
operations. He will laugh at the appearances which the world manifests, and assume the ground which nothing but ignorance can prompt
him to maintain-daring to sneer at the great laws which govern this

and other worlds, when in reality he has not the capacity to comprehend the component parts of one atom that goes to compose the
Universe!
There are, however, some lofty and noble characters in the world.
They do not hesitate to sacrifice their individual interest for the interest they feel in Truth. Possessing a high sense of conscientiousness, and a deep and solemn veneration, the very elements of moral
philanthropy compose their nature and desires: and these, with intense and patient deliberation, search deeply into the causes of the
social effects which are visibly manifested.  Their interest is involved
in exploring, investigating, and revealing, the cause that produces the
disunion and disorganization which spread persecution throughout
the world, and which genders vice and misery, and consequent personal and national wretchedness. Such a one, with the best feelings
and actuated by the best of motives, dares to lift his voice against the
causes of the prevailing evils in society. He does this with firmness,
and yet with a feeling of philanthropy and benevolence. Ile addresses himself to the world in the mildest language. He states the
truth with simplicity yet fearlessly; and his thoughts are not contracted to one particular society or state, but he speaks forth his
irresistible convictions to the world.  The world opposes him with
its varied interests, individual, sectarian, denominational, and political.  These weapons are hurled against him with anger, and the fire
of indignation and wrath is set against his efforts; and he is finally
obliged to leave the field as a reformer, and retires in despondency
and heartfelt wretchedness!  He no longer feels life a blessing, but
longs for the dissolving elements that compose his being to terminate
their work. Discouraged with the experience of this life, he seeks
for a future.  He arrives, through analogy, at the conclusion which
- e sought, stops breathless and amazed, and sinks to be kncwn no
more!  And is this free thought and unrestricted inquiry?
The man who presumes upon knowledge which is merely super..
ficial, is praised and approbated.  He maintains the sentiments of the
institutions which cover the land. He freely enters and breathes
their atmosphere, when he has an internal consciousness and irresist —
ible conviction that it is deleterious to the world.  He not only assumes all this, but he is sustained in his assumptions by the stronglyfortified denominational institutions to which he personally adheres..

~ictiolis of his nature, and claims an atmosphere of light and liberty
to express them —and his voice is hushed; his influence is arrested
by private and public denunciation! And is this free thought?  If
truth exists, why is it closed to all examinations of a free mind? If
truth one possesses, why should he be afraid of investigation? If
one has found truth, why should he not be permitted to manifest it to
the world? If an interest should be taken in truth, which is more
powerful than any motive of selfishness, why not take hold and assist
every new reformer? If knowledge is desirable, why not let it become universal? If this generation is now open to free inquiry, why
does it not receive the truths which are obscurely yet daily rnanifested?
And here a former declaration may be repeated: That anything
which tends to oppose or in any way to retard the progress of the
highest and holiest principle of man, which is Reason, carries, by.such opposition, internal conviction to cve~ry person of capacity and
ilvtelligence, that it is errioncous and very imnlerfect.
6 5. To further view and contemplate the causes that have pre-vented the progress of knowledge and morality, it is necessary again
ato reflect upon the dark and deplorable picture of man's primitive
iristory. Kingdoms warred against kingdoms; and nations were
persecuted, divided, and destroyed. From the ruins of each, new
kingdoms and nations have been formed, each holding its respective.and exclusive rights. Each has founded barbarous and sectarian
institutions, and established standards, marking and limiting the extent of thought.  And those who have dared to go beyond the boundary marked out by their spiritual shepherds, have been tortured and
put to death under the sanction of the nation or the church. Horrible and dreadful machines have been invented to compel men to
believe that which was sanctioned by public opinion; and they were
Jhus forced to bow physically, but not mentally.  They might b)e,compelled to bend the body in humble submission to these inhuman
tortures, yet the mind could not be made to waver or change. Pris~ons were erected to confine within their walls the depressed and
afflicted who claimed the right of free thought and expression. Asylums and hospitals were erected to contain the emaciated and insane,
made so by existing institutions; and there men were compelled to
linger out a long and wearisome existence.  There they were chained:and plunged into unmingled and unimaginable gloom! No combi

nation of figures -would be adequate to express the number of prayers
that have been offered for their physical dissolution. Others, again,
would kneel in faith and submission to these tyrannical institutionswith their eyes closed and their minds circumscribed to the narrow
and contracted circle which was well marked out and defined by
their leaders. Revolutions and rebellions against kings and kingJoins, sects and institutions, caused an incalculable amount of life
and property to be sacrificed: for when man could no longer endure
Ihis unfortunate condition, his mental and physical energies would be
aroused to one vast rebellion against its causes; and thus, from time
to time have been conquered and subdued the inexorable laws and
institutions of the kingdoms.
Theguillotine was no less an invention to destroy man and prevent
crime, than the modern gallows. It was then thought to be a mediumn of great good in promoting the morals of the world; but it is now
considered as a relic of the ignorance and degradation of former generations. It still stands as an engine of destruction —as do also
prisons and asylums as receptacles for deranged and insane beings.
These are supported by the laws of the nations —and are all founded
upon the evils arising out of misconceptions of human rights and of
the laws of Nature.
Free institutions (so chilled), for the general diffusion of science
and knowledge, are sustained and sanctioned by the nation and the
church, which claim the exclusive right and privilege to enforce their
own doctrines and opinions, and to prevent the introduction of any
new ones. It would be well, however, for the world to solve and
give answers to the following questions: Are there not existing in
some instances, innumerable opinions relative to one particular science?
Are there not a great number of physicians whose theory and practice are in direct opposition?  Can there be more than one true religion?  Is there not one foundation for each science?  Must there
not be one true and universal medical theory and practice? These
are not all true; but which is?
The progress of light and knowledge in the world, will develop
the true relation between nature and science and science and Man.
Man's course is onward. Thought is like a great ocean whose tide
is continually rising, but unlike the waters of earth, it will not again
ebb. Truth is one vast Mountain, lifting its head with exalted dignity. It stands unmoved, and will not bow to the caprices of man;
yet man will progress until he reaches its very heights.  Ignorance

and error can not remove its foundation, nor prevent the progress of
mental and moral attainment. Xerxes, marching with his mighty
army to invade Greece, and being obstructed in his progress by the
lofty Mount Athos —with the assumed pomp of ignorance and selfsufficiency, and feeling that he possessed all power, raised his hand
and commanded it in imperious tones to give way and let him pass.
He threatened its destruction if it did not quail at his voice: but
finding it would not move, he commenced the tiresome work of perforating his way through it. But large and massive rocks obstructed
his progress. And then his mighty bridge over the Hellespont became
broken in pieces and destroyed. On seeing this, he commanded
that by large stones and chains, the waves should be bound and repressed. But the waters heeded him not; but with a steady and
fearless progress, ebbed and flowed as in derision of his feeble and
prostrate powers. And so with the ocean of moral and intellectual
progress.  Urged by the great impetus, the love of truth, it will flow
on until it subdues and overflows all that is of an opposite nature, and
the world will be cleansed and renovated, and man will stand in the
brightness and beauty of his nature.  Then there will be diffused
from this great source, a universal good, as constituting one Principle,
one universal thought and action, one grand and lofty aspiration for
perfection.  Then all will compose ONTE BODY-whose organs will
reciprocally assist and promote the good of each other. And there
will be no absorbents, no excrescences, no superfluous or imperfect
parts.  There will not be any individual or general wretchedness or
distress; but all will act on the principles of their nature, as these
will be set forth in the following Revelation.
6~. The object of the foregoing has been to exhibit to the mind
the past and present condition of the world as viewed in its intellectual and moral aspects; to show that-the, privilege of unrestrained
investigation is yet limited, and to notice specifically the causes of
mental restriction.  It has been the object to make these causes plain
to the understanding, by viewing retrospectively the condition of generations past —and to prove all things, and retain that only which is
just and good.  It is thus perceived that ignorance has been the
cause of all the distress, vice, misery, and wretchedness, that have
prevailed.  And the existing cause of this ignorance is individual,
local, and national prejudices-closing men's minds and their institutions against any new revealments of truth.  Ecclesiastical bodies

have contributed most to this state of things. Any progression, or
the revealment of any new truths, in theological matters, has been
discountenanced and treated with intolerance. They have taught,
and do still teach, that such is impious and sinful. The consequence
has been the establishment of the most confirmed and deeply-rooted
prejudices.  Hence men who have progressed in knowledge, and
have offered their attainments to the world, have been repelled by
strongly-fortified prejudices, and have been classed either with mystics or skeptics. And many indeed have become skeptics from such
causes.  But being free from the conventionalisms of the world, they
have freely examined all phenomena and manifestations external, and
by these means have arrived unbiased at truths, and have embraced
them for their own sake. Such persons have a high sense of honor,
justice, and conscientiousness, and do good for the love thereof.
And is this the nineteenth century? And has ignorance so prevailed that the spiritual and internal principle of man has become
hidden and obscured? And is this an age in which such a principle
should be doubted? Seven times have I been requested to explain
the nature and composition of Spirit.  What an age to ask such a
question! But this has been propounded by men of free and ex
pansive minds, willing to receive truth if evidently manifested, but
who would not and could not believe unless a cause was shown adequate to produce the effect to be believed.  This skepticism is honest;t
this honesty is virtue; this virtue is the principle which should govern man in all his mental and moral actions.
But I have frequently been in connexion with persons whom I
have found to be dishonest skeptics, and who concealed the same by
wearing a fashionable cloak of hypocrisy. From these I expect
criticisms, reviews, and obstruction. From these will be noticed the
greatest manifestations of fear of deception and imposition.  These
will decry, retard, and oppose; and to these I have nothing to offer.
But to the honest inquirer after truth, this Revelation is submitted,
that by it he may become convinced of, and familiar with, the immutable laws which govern Nature and man.  And to him I would
say, "Follow me through this investigation, and then decide for or
against the conclusions arrived at, according to the preponderance of
evidence which you receive." And it is the duty and interest of the
world to subject these developments to investigation; and such is the
positive and fearless demand of the subject. And by revealing and
making plain to man, through his organizatidn, or senses, the teach0          n~'  " ""'~"

ilngs of Nature, and the true principles of reasoning from cause to
effect, the race may be elevated, united, and rendered happy.
~ 7. OUTWARD searching after truth, and inductions drawn from the
appearances of substances external, has been thought the only process
by which man can demonstrate tangible realities. Men generally
proceed in this way to become convinced of the reality of thingsare satisfied only in proportion as evidence appeals to their senses,
respecting forms visible, and consider this as the only test of truth
and reality. Such men found their belief or disbelief, in the evidences of their senses, making the outward passive, and the inward
active.  Objects and manifestations observed, they take as the test
of truth: things which are invisible and imperceptible, they either
doubt, or arrive at the conclusion that their existence is imaginative
and visionary. Hence men have expended much talent in forming
theories founded on visible facts and appearances; and probably the
following generation will experience and witness phenomena relative
to this science,* which will be in direct contradiction of the theories
received.
Theories founded on facts visible, men have labored to reduce to
science.  Believing that the fact which existed was attributable to
some cause invisible, search has been made, and the real cause evidently demonstrated.  From this men have reasoned to the effect,
which was visible and manifest. This reasoning is the true reasoning-proving visible effects by imperceptible and invisible causes.
Sciences have been founded upon this ground, which can not be overthrown: that is, their causes are true, and their effects are true, ana
to be depended upon as a general rule. But those who might expect
their effects to manifest themselves to the senses as unchlang'eable,
would inevitably be mistaken as respects their particulars and ninzutice. There are such things as general causes to produce general
effects: but there is not such a thing as a general cause manifesting
invariably both general and minute effects, particularly when these
effects are looked for or expected in forms.
Upon Man, for instance, many useful and correct sciences have

been established.  Man has witnessed corporeal phenomena as pr.
ceeding from his organism, and presenting many varied and mnysterious manifestations. Upon his form has been established the science of Anatomy. Theories and books have been given to the world
almost without number, giving extensive and minute delineations of
his anatomical structure.  Many of these have been received as true
in all their descriptions of the generals and particulars of the structure
of man. It is generally supposed that the extensive study which
has been employed on the science of Anatomy, prohibits even a possibility of its being in any particular erroneous or misunderstood.
Practice has been established; and this science has been a chart and
directory to the practitioner.  But every practitioner will give in his
experience as dif'ering from that of others, in many particulars.  All
depend upon the structure of the human system, which they have
found invariably the same; but in the minutiae of practice, they differ
exceedingly. Thus the foundation of practice (or the theory of the
anatomy of the human system) is proved to be invariably true by the
united experience and observation of all men; but the minutiac and
particulars have been found irregular in their manifestations.  And
this proves that particuliars, as looked for through the medium of the
external senses, are not to be depended upon.
The science of Physiology has also,been proved in generals, but
not in particulars. *The science of Phrenology has been proved demonstratively to every erudite man of science, and is admitted to be
true as regards its foundation and genceral phenomena.  It comprehends the structure of the organ of the mind, including its undulations and developments as indicated on the external surface of the
cranium.  And practitioners in this science know its truth by its
many manifestations in shape, size, and general appearances. These
hold good as general indications; but when their 21articztla.r and minute effects are looked for, there will be observed extreme variances.
Thus this science is true in its gencrals, and is to be invariably relied
upon; but its minutiae vary greatly in their manifestations. All sciences relative to man and his physical and mental organization, are
truthful and to be relied on, as is demonstrated by the general and
united experience of all mankind. But the ultimates and minutiae
are changeable —-the anatomical, physiological, and phrenological
constitution of man, being the bases on which these sciences are
founded.  And effects and ultimate minutiae are also observed differently by every person, even when they are invariable.

24               THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
Thus man, making the external the test of truth and reality, be
comes invariably and inevitably deceived. Reasoning from cause to
effect, is the only sure guide to truth: and then analogy and association may follow, as carrying direct evidence to the mind of that which
is beyond the reach of the senses. If external and visible appearances are the correct test of truth and reality, whence the innumerable
theories that are presented in explanation of any one of the sciences?
All agree indisputably as to the Jbundation and cautse; but each widely
differs from others in accounting for the various effects and rtmaliifestatiowas. Is not this conclusive evidence against making external appearances the test of positive and absolute truth and reality?
For illustration: Suppose you cast your eyes upon a beautiful
fruit.  It is pleasing and enticing to the eye; it is grateful to the
palate; it is pleasing in its action upon the taste and stomach. You
saw it: that convinced you of its reality. But had you any evidence
of its?niznutie and effects?  The general was known: the ])mrticular
was not known; for in a few hours, in a given instance, this same
fruit works out a most deleterious and destructive effect.  What evidence then hnd. you of the real reality, by knowing that the fruit did
exist by the evidence of vision?
But in all psychological research and investigation, the exte:nal and
mznf/jEst have been made the test of inward 7reality.  Reasoning from
effects, in a retrograde manner, men have arrived at non-entity, and
become confirmed in a disbelief of anything beyond what the senses
will recognise as existing. Are you not convinced by the fluctuating
nature of things external, temporal, and transient, and which are fleeting and evanescent as the leaves of the trees, that these are mere
effects, and not realities?- that the real or cause is invisiblr, and the
effect is a mere transient cxpression? For matter and form can not
be depended upon as producing the same and unchangeable appearances.  For there is a perpetual exhalation and inhalation going on
throughout all Nature imperceptibly-a steady flux and reflux of
matter, daily, hourly, and secondly, as changing forms and appearances. Are you not convinced that the causes of this continual
changing throughout all Nature are invisible, not to be heard or seen,
yet nevertheless actual and real?  From this you will learn to make
the test of truth the amount of evidence you receive throug/h the organization, and not that originating in the organization.  Make the
body, the organs, the medium  through which you test reality.
Be passive in the inward; active on the outward. The outward is

an instrument, an agent, a medium through which may be tested
things external.
~ 8. That my meaning may be more distinctly comprehended, let
it be observed that the body is aform, is transient, is changeable: the
intcrnal is not changeable.  The man is the intcrnal: the effect or
form is external.  The mind is not acted upon by, but acts on, the
body.  That which is internal is the reality: that which it acts on
is visible and mortal. And all appearances foreign are composed
of the same mortal ingredients — mortal in the restricted sense of that
term.
Now it being proved that the visible is not the real, but that the
Inv iible is the eternal, it follows that you must make the test of truth
to consist in an imperceptible, yet unchangeable and eternal principle.
Admitting this much, you are able to advance one step further in the
cognizance of probable possibilities. Effects are witnessed: they are
traced to an immediate cause, which is demonstrated by strict and
severe analysis. This cause producing this effect, shows you that
the effect is not withiout a cause.  This effect produces another, and
that also another; and so by analogy you may see that there is an
endless and incalculable amount of causes and effects. And tracin~g
effects to causes, and causes to effects, is the correct process of reasoning: and this you do in your imagination until you arrive at a
chaos of existence, —then stop breathless and return to ask, What
was the cause of the first cause? You would not have gone upon
these trackless peregrinations, if you had but considered all forms and
externals as not causes, but effects.  In process of this Key to the
Revelation which is to follow, you will receive still further evidence
directly in favor of this form of reasoning.
I will here indicate the order of reasoning and investigation to be
pursued.  First, we are to commence at the First Cause, and trace
causes to their effects, until we reach the hluman body, which is an
ultimate effect of the Great Cause.  To prevent this train of remark
from being considered as based upon senseless hypothesis, we will
also trace the ultimate effect through cause and effect, until we arrive
at the First Cause. Approaching with deep reverence the First
Cause, we will commence at the Great Head of all existence, and
through the formation and operation of all spheres celestial, trace the
chain of existence to the terrestrial, and until we arrive at the last
effect, or the ultimate, —considering it to be an eternity which pro

duces and reproduces spheres, existences, and forms, until there is an
infinite expansion of ultimates. And this process will be understood
by the following familiar illustration: The germ, roots, body, branches.
limbs, buds, blossoms, beauty.  Or this: Water, steam, ether, immnteriatl. Or: Fall, winter, spring, and summer in its brightness and
beauty. The great train of investigation which is soon to follow, is
based upon the principles of reasoning which have been laid down
and illustrated.
And conceive of a germ being hidden beneath the surface of this
hard earth. Imagine that you forget its existence. Let a few years
of time elapse, and then cast your eyes to the spot where it was cont.ealed, and you see a lofty and beautiful tree, standing in all the
majesty and dignity of its nature. And would it not be as absurd
and impossible to disbelieve the existence, as it would be to doubt for
one moment the germ which has produced this existence? The tree
stands, and is visible as an ultimate: mlan; stands, and he is also an
ultimate.  The germ of the tree, you knew of its existence; but the
germ of the world, you do not know of its existence. But is it not
evident that the latter is at least possible, since the first is known and
demonstrated? By even assenting to such a possibility, you have
become prepared to take one more carefitl step in this investigation.
By the next careful step which is to be taken, is meant the admission of the process here indicated, as being the only correct mode of
reasoning.  But before this step is taken, it becomes highly necessary to illustrate still further the truthfulness of this rule, tracing synthetically visible effects to their causes, and analytically causes to their
effects. The transition firom the usual mode of reasoning to this,
would be too sudden for the mind to receive, without its being made
still more plain by reasons deduced from general truths, as they are
indisputably and extensively known to exist. Illustrations and representations which have been made are direct, but too comprehensive
to be familiarly understood, in proof that things which are visible and
external, are only tangible effects and ultimates of causes invisible.
The following is to make still more plain the reason of this reasoning:All things external, in forms, series, and degrees,* appear to different persons to present different manifestations. Suppose a man diseased: physicians examine his case, guided both by the physiological
* What is meant by " forms, series, and degrees," is the unfoldings of the various
and successive stages or kingdoms of creation, as the sequel will illustrate.

manifestations of the disease, and by the feelings which the disease
produces, which are not perceptible to them by any process of external observation. The patient communicates his own feelings, the
physicians taking these for granted; and from these, together with
the symptoms mnaniest, they decide upon the name of the disease.
Each of these physicians, from the evidence which he has received
through the senses, differs from the others as to the character of the
disease.  Have you not here proof that the external and manifest is
the effect and can not be relied on, while the cause is hidden?-And
you do not possess any means, by which you can investigate its
cause.
Again: A man has a carious tooth: he tells you he experiences a
severe pain; but you doubt his word, and ask for proof.  He points
you to the tooth, which is the object tangible. But does the evidence
of which your senses admit, convince you. that he has a pain? The
tooth is the external, the ultimate: the pain is the invisible, but
reality. In both of the above cases, are you not internally convinced
that you must adopt some other process of reasoning and investigation to find the true cause of the objects manifested?  Conclusions
drawn from things visible, which are effects and ultimates, can not be
so reliable as inferences drawn from internal causes as to their legitimate effects.
One more illustration: You have a foundation of belief which you
call the evidence of your senses, and which you implicitly rely on
as proving truth and reality. But notwithstanding the evidence which
you may receive through the senses, particularly that of vision, the
following illustration will enable you to conceive of the possibility of
inte-crnal truths: The whole world of mankind can give in their united testimonies that they positively and absolutely see the sun rising
in the east, and setting in the west.  Is there not internal evidence
that the external and manifest of this is positively unreal?  Inward
searching after truth has established the cause of this phenomenon,
and proved that the sun does not move. But it is the visible and exlernal that you are deceived by, and not the invisible, which is the
reality. True philosophy embraces both of these processes of reasoning- synthetically from effect to cause, and analytically from cause
to effect. The philosopher who pursues only one of these processes,
is not a philosopher; but he who adopts both, is a true philosopher,
and has true philosophy. Admitting this as the true course, you become a reasoner from internal realities to external, visible effects.

28              THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
~ 9. And now free your minds from all things present, and retrospectively view the past: Have you not times innumerable been perfectly deceived by visible manifestations? Has not appearance often
been in direct opposition to the reality?  Has not the appearance of
a person deceived you when you least supposed it possible? Have
not the particulars-the minutiae of everything familiar to your
senses, irregularly presented different and opposite manifestations?
Have you not been mistaken almost as often as you have relied on
this as a mode of receiving truth? Desponding on the deceptions
caused by a reliance upon things external and manifest, has not the
whole become repulsive to many minds, and have they not doubted
appearances and totally disbelieved invisibles? If so, how inexpressible should be man's delight to know that that is not real which is
visible?  A person may have a passion or an emotion; he may have
sentiments and thoughts which are not known to exist by any other
person; for a thought is invisible.  The only process by which the
world may become convinced of its existence, is its manifestation on
the body-the external being the effect or ultimate; the cause internal and real.
So with every form and manifestation, tangible and external.
You see light: you are thus convinced by the evidence of vision
that that light exists. It may proceed from various states of matter,
from fire, or a candle. But does the sight of it convince you as to
the nature of its source? If you had not the conviction previously
that it would burn, then by presenting any part of the body in cornnexion with it, you would find the reality of fire: but of this yco
would know nothing until it was proved by a different process from
that of external and tangible manifestations. This presents evidence
conclusive that the internal is the cause and reality; the external,
the effect and ultimate. Why judge ye not yourselves of the right?
External representations have been too much relied on as proof of
reality.  The outside of the platter was clean; but the inside-the
invisible- was full of extortion and excess. Arriving at these truths,
(which will be universally acknowledged), have you not seen sufficient reason not to pursue this course any longer?
It is now clearly seen and proved that the things which constitute
causes, are invisible, and that their effects are manifested in all forms
external. Hence the latter can not be realitics; for such a supposition would involve a self-inconsistency.
The process of reasoning thus to be adopted, is based on an inte

gral view of the universe. And by resting on positive, and not or.
particular-depending on general and not on minutiae in external
manifestations, your expectations will be realized in the general
manifestations. Associating cause and effect with analogy and correspondence, observing forms, series, degrees, associations, and
spheres, is to be the method by which their future condition will be
shown to be in analogy with things which are here visible. But this
is not to be commenced until the careful step is taken: and that is
to prove the visible by the invisible. And the foundation of true
reasoning being established, it brings with it irresistibly the conviction of this state,* which you are to have evidently demonstrated to
yourself internal. Proof of this state, and of the source from which
I received these impressions, must be made apparent and conspicuous
before you feel yourself constrained to admit the contents of the following Revelation. In order that the real foundation of my impressions may be established, it is necessary to first explain the admitted
science known as Animal Magnetism — upon which I will proceed
to explain this state, of the real importance of which you receive
cxternally but little evidence.
To comprehend a subject so vast and extensive as that of animal
or human magnetism, and to familiarize the mind with its various
and mysterious phenomena, with the main features of its manifestation, and with the grounds upon which it rests, it becomes highly
necessary to make illustrations relative to the proofs to be introduced. A man intending a journey to some foreign country, would,
if a judicious traveller, familiarize himself with the geography of it,
and acquaint himself with the maps and charts of the various ways
by following which he might reach the place of his destination.
These he would know in order that he might not misunderstand the
direction of, and means of proceeding to, the place where he intends to
terminate. Of the existence of the place lie does not know by any
direct evidence through his organization, but of this lie is convinced
by the previous reports of men, and by the uniform admission of all.
So with this science: its foundation and basis must be admitted by
the evidences of previous research and investigation, instituted by'erudite men, both in this and previous generations. But the many
ways which lead to its peculiar phenomena, it is proper to become
familiar with, in order to arrive at its legitimate attributes.  The direction to its known results may be given in the following explanaThe abnormal state in which this was dictated.

tion; and the guide to the paths will be the isolated facts presented
in the remarks upon individual and universal experience.
The foundation of this science can not be doubted: for it is admitted that there are existing two fluids, which may here be termed
tM:agnetism and Electricity. In making the subject familiar to the
understanding, it is proper to give a brief description of the organs
of sells 3.
Tile organ of vision is supposed to be the only medium by which
iman can commumlni:te with the external world, in such a way as to
receive a knowledge of forms and substances foreign from his reach.
The retina acts as a medium for the intervention of things visible,
the reflection of which it comes in contact with; and thence the
impression goes through the optic nerve to the brain or seat of perception.
The ear is supposed to be the only medium to receive the vibration
of external disturbances; and it is thought that hearing can not exist
without the perfection of this organ. The tympanum, its mem
brane, bones, and stapes, are thought to be requisite to perform this
office.  But physiologists are aware, by innumerable experiments,
that the tympanic membrane and the small bones, with the exception
of the stapes, may be totally destroyed without materially injuring
that sense. Hence there must be a different medium through which
that sensation may be produced.
The organ of smell may also lose some of its parts, and still per
form its office.  The various convoluted parts of the nasal organ are
not developed until the child is quite advanced; still the sensation
of this organ is apparently manifested in the earlier stages of its development.
The organ of speech also can exist without every part of its present structure. The lingual nerve may be severed; yet there will
be existing muscular action of the tongue, and a continual performance of its office.
The sense of fecling may be partially destroyed, from some external and incidental connexion, such as may partially paralyze its
action; yet there will be still existing acute sensitiveness of this
sense.
~ 10. Each of these senses may and does perform its office indirectly upon the mind, without any direct interference or connexion with
anything external.  This is demonstrated by the experience of ev

ery person during the hours of slumber. It is generally supposed
that thoughts will not be excited upon tangible realities, without a
direct connexion between the organs and such realities: and it is
also supposed that the nerves of sensation, which are active in conveying all the organic impressions to the mind, can only be excited
by the action of the external upon them, to transmit the emotion
necessary to generate thought.  This is not entirely correct; —and
the true state of the case will be known by appeals to your own experience during your normal and abnormal existence. During the
hours of physical repose, while the parts of the system are recruiting
and reproducing new strength and energy, and while the organs of
sense are closed to all external impressions, the mind, free from all
obtrusive and disturbing influences, makes imaginative excursions to
different places and contemplates different things in existence. It
supposes it sees or hears; while sometimes it is arrested in its travels by the sound of beautiful music, or by various pleasing scenes
which it appears to enjoy. Sometimes it supposes it walks, feels,
tastes, or suffers excruciating pain.  It also appears to be irresistibly
in many places, where it had no previous desire or intention to be.
During all of these peregrinations, the wave of sound, the reflection
of sight, the susceptibility of feeling, the pleasure of tasting, are all
supposed to be enjoyed.  This can not be Spirit; for if it were, it
would be distinguished by the perfection of all its qualifications
during its disconnected state from  the body.  This is Mllind, connected with the body; and the impression which it receives through
the disturbed condition of the nerves of sensation. This proves
that there is an internal medium of sensation by which the mind
enjoys its capacity as if the external were in connexion with the
world.  It proves also that there is a medium, which I have not yet
named, existing upon these nerves of sensation, independent botl]
of internal and external exciting causes.
Having thus established the existence of an independent, conscious medium, I will now proceed to explain its existence.  And
of this the foundation is universally known and admitted, and hence
it is not necessary to speak particularly in reference to its existence.
This foundation is the muscular and sympathetic nerves. A synopsis of the theory is as follows: Man possesses two coatings, which
are classified as the serous and mucous surfaces.  The serous covers
each organ, nerve, and fascia of the muscles, including the whole of
their surfaces.  The mucous surfaces constitute the inner of every

32              THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
organ, nerve, and muscle. The serous surfaces and mucous generate
and sustain a positive and negative fluid.  This controls the circulation. The negative expands the ventricles, and that attracts the blood
to its reservoir. The positive contracts the ventricles, and thus repulses the blood throughout the system. Hence there is a continual
expansion and attraction, and contraction and repulsion-which illustrates familiarly the office of these forces. The serous surfaces are
susceptible of feeling, while the mucous surfaces are not.  The muscular nerves are controlled by the mind, while the sympathetic, or
nerves of sensation, are the medium of actuating the mind, whose
motion produces thought.
The brain is composed of a sensitive and complicated composition
of fibres, to which no other part of the body bears any analogy. Being sensitive, it is attractive or positive to all that is existing on the
nervous medium: hence it receives impressions irresistibly. It possesses within itself the positive and negative poles, or greater and
lesser parts: the one controlling, the other subject; the one receiving
power, the other transmitting and exercising power. The ethereal
substance which serves as a medium, may be termed Magnetism.
The muscular motion of the system is performed through the medium of the substance which may be termed Electricity.  When there
is a full and uninterrupted exercise of all the powers and organs
of the body; when there is a harmony existing throughout the
whole physical system, there is perfect health and enjoyment; because its forces (which are positive and negative, or magnetic and
electric) are regularly performing their functions: and this indicates
a perfect condition of the magnetic or nervous medium. Nevertheless, when the body becomes deranged in any of its various parts, it
is a loss of the positive or negative powerwhvllich produces its health
and harmonious action. But when all parts are in perfect unison
and harmony, then the system is thoroughly magnetized.  In order
to demagnetize it, you must in some way overcome the equilibrium,
and extract the positive power by a power still more positive; and
this will produce the unconscious state called the magnetic.
The medium, heretofore explained, exists between all organic beings. Magnetism composes the sphere-rather the atmosphereby which every person is individually surrounded. And besides
this, there is a medium existing which extends through all things,
placing man over the lower animal creation. For animals are subjected to man's control by the positive or subduingr power which he





## p. 33 (#61) ##############################################


'THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  33
possesses; and they receive this to their minds by the same medium
which exists between an organ and the brain.  Man being positive,
and all else negative, the latter must yield to his control. Here
again is proof that the internal, invisible, is the real cause of all external and ultimate manifestations.
~ 11. The state termed magnetic can be produced by the following process (which is not in any way confusing the laws of Nature,
but instead thereof, is only developing its powers and attributes,
which have not been known to exist as appertaining to animal or
physical creation): One system coming in contact with another of
less positive power, will be attractive (the attraction depending upon
the medium  universally established), and will attract the positive
power from the patient or subject, with whom the former is in contact; and the positive or magnetic force which is attracted from the
subject's system, is that which exists upon the nerves of sensation,
which terminate in the serous surfaces. This fluid being withdrawn,
the patient is not susceptible of external impressions, simply because
the medium by which these are transmitted is absent.  He is them
demagnetized-leaving sensation only existing upon the internal or
mucous surfaces which produce vital action. The negative power
remains; the positive does not remain. Vital action becomes torpid
and feeble according to the loss of power which previously controlled
it.  This is the magnetic state; and in this peculiar condition, the
patient is in sympathy with, or is submissive to the will or positive
magnetic power of, the operator.  This is the first state.
The subject in the first state is obedient to the will or wish of the
operator, through an established equilibrium of the two forces which
must exist in all things to produce motion.  The subject is negative4;
the operator is positive.  Hence the negative phenomena, witnessed
in the patient's system, stand in analogy to muscular motion or nega-.
tive manifestations in one man.  The subject and operator form oule
system in power. There is a visible disunion, yet there does exist
an invisible union. One is positive, the other negative; and the one.

representation illustrates the condition: Man, when uninterrupted inl
any of his functional capacities, stands magnetized; one part of his
system being positive, the other negative, and the two being united&
by an equilibrium which does (yet invisibly) exist; and all phenolnena nroduced by llis mind as the positive, upon his body as tp negf2

tive, are parallel to what takes place in the patient and the operator.
It is not necessary to give a minute description of the various changes
and modifications which these potent fluids pass through. But the
fact is visible, manifest-produced by the real, invisible, yet the
primary cause all the external appearances.
To convince the rational mind of the foregoing inductions, I will
state the position which the true reasoner occupies: There is a contillual antagonism between faith and doubt.  The true reasoner stands
as a mediator between the two.  Man can not disbelieve nor believe
-there is no such thing as disbelief or belief-without evidenace to
produce one decision or the other.  To be a disbeliever, man requires
in reality the same amount of evidence that he does to become a
believer.  The mere expression of belief or disbelief has no meaning
unless it is determined by a sufficient and reasonable amount of evi-dence. Supposing you to stand as a mediator between belief and
disbelief, and to require the same amount of evidence to make you
sake either side, I now ask you this question in reference to the explanation of this subject: Have you not received a sufficient amount
of internal, conscious evidence, to make you take the side of the beiiever?  If you have not, then your evidence must be sufficiently:strong and powerful to make you disbelieve; and this it is your duty
to make known as extensively as possible, in order to settle the antagonism existing between faith and doubt upon this particular subject.'Thus the phenomenon, known as nmag-netlc, does not controvert or.suibvrt in any way the laws of Nature; but instead thereof, such
should be looked upon as a progression and further development of
the laws which govern organic beings. The placing of one person
in the:magnetic state, he composing the negative, and the operator
the positive, thus brings the law that controls one system in its variolus parts, to control two beings, as composing one with all the requisite magnetic forces.
It would not be inappropriate here to introduce a few thoughts
upon'the uatility of this influence in alleviating the sufferings of hunmanity. There are several classes of disease which greatly excite
the nerves and surfaces upon which the magnetic medium exists; and,excitement causes them to generate an excessive amount of the mag-;netic medium, or positive fluid. This often produces excessive
fevers.  When intense, it affects the brain, and often produces awful
paroxysms and (lerangements-which could all be removed by the

'I'lE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                35
contact of a person who is strongly positive.  By this would be ex
tracted the superabundance of heat, or magnetic ether, which being
excessive, produces the effects above described. In all cases where
there is too great an amount of positive power, it can be relieved by
the application of a due and superior amount of positive power.  All
excess of heat, or fever, such as is caused by innumerable derangements of the system, can be invariably reduced to an equilibrium by
employing this new development.
There are properly four magnetic states.  In thefirst, no particular phenomena are witnessed, only that, the external organs being in
some measure divested of their ordinary share of magnetism, a feeling of dulness pervades the system.  Persons in this state lose none
of their senses, but are susceptible to all external impressions. They
have also the full power of muscular action; and if situated nearly
midway between the first and second states, they are inclined to happy
feelings. And all phenomena witnessed in this state, are only of a
physical nature: but in the higher states, the phenomena consist in
the development of the mental powers.
The next state, or the second, manifests itself through the mental
organization.  The patient still manifests his intellectual faculties, but
is deprived of all muscular power. The pupil of the eye expands,
and that organ refuses to act on the brain.  The tympanic membrane
and cavity of the ear expand and refuse to perform their wonted action. The extremities are somewhat cold.  In the latter part of this
state all sensation and feeling is destroyed, so that any surgical operation can be performed without giving pain.  The patient in this condition appears mentally associated with the operator.  All the external
organs being closed, there is no possible means of receiving impressions from without; but all phenomena are produced through the
medium which exists between the operator and the patient. Hence
there are sympathetic, incoherent, and indefinite accounts received
from the mind of the patient, which are analogous to the impressions
of the man previously spoken of, who seemingly recognised external
realities during his moments of dreaming.  Thus the phenomena are
of a mental nature, and are a natural production of the mind so
situated.
12. The ear is not entirely closed to sound in the first part of the
third state.  The patient can hear indistinctly, possesses the power
of speech, and partly of muscular action. About the middle of this

state, the ear is completely closed, and all impressions made upon
the brain from external objects, are at an end. The patient is then
placed in an unconscious condition so far as the external world is
concerned. Divested of his ordinary share of magnetism, he possesses just enough to perform vital action.
In this state there is a strong sympathy existing between the operator and his subject. The chain of sympathy which connects the
mind of the operator with that of his subject, is animal electricity, —
the same fluid which is the agent of all muscular motion.  It is
through the agency of this fluid that magnetic sleep is induced. The
operator sits down with the determination to put his subject to sleep:
all the powers of his mind are concentrated on this object. His will
being exercised to this point, the electric fluid passes from his own
brain and nerves, to the brain and system of his patient, and forms
between the two, a chain of sympathy.  The one, then, is completely subject to the control of the other; and in this manner you
may easily account for all the phenomena witnessed in the sympathetic somnambulist.
In this state the patient is wholly unsusceptible to any tangible or
physical connexion, no feeling existing upon the surfaces.  The
magnetic medium is far less active than in the previous states; but
the negative or muscular forces are still preserved. At this crisis the
mind is extremely susceptible of external mediums which connect
mind to matter. Hence the subject appears to see and hear, and to
perform many wonderful and mysterious things, during this condition
of the mental faculties. This is a state of still higher mental development, and of consciousness or perception of mediums. This is
often supposed to be the clairroyant state; but it is not.  It stands
in analogy to natural somnambulism; only one is a phenomenon induced by magnetism, and the other is a similar mental state, but naturally produced by an inactivity of the magnetic medium or sensation.
The magnetic subject has progressed in his mental capacity toward
the state known as death: for the positive power does not remain,
%while the negative or muscular does remain. -And the increased perception of the mind is through the medium of its own association.
Passing from the third to thefourth state, a still greater and higher
mental manifestation will be observed. About midway between these
two conditions, the mind loses almost all its sympathy which attaches
it'to the system. At this time the chain of sympathy existing between the positive and negative, is nearly disconnected. The mind





## p. 37 (#65) ##############################################


THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                 37
becomes free from all inclinations which the body would subject it to,
and only sustains a connexion by a very minute and rare medium,
the same that connects one thought with another.  In this condition
the patient progresses into the fourth state. Then the mind becomes
free from the organization, except as connected by the medium be
fore mentioned; and then it is capable of receiving impressions of
foreign or proximate objects, according to the medium with which it
particularly becomes associated. The body at this time is dormant
and inactive in all its parts, except the negative, or muscular and vital
action, which is constantly kept up and controlled by the united forces
of the olerator upon the operatee.
And this stands in analogy to that natural state of physical disunion
known as death. Death is produced by the loss of both forces; but
the clairvoyant state is produced by the blending of the forces of the
two persons, and making them physically equivalent to one.  The
mind, in the first case, loses all of the medium which connects it with
the body: the latter is the same state mentally with the former, with the
exception of the medium referred to. All the phenomena are seen,
and do exist, with every being.  Their healthy state is the magnetic
state, and the various conditions and developments of the mind during sleep, until death, are analogous to the various phenomena
induced by magnetism, — only one is an ordinary manifestation, and
the other is a further development of the same principles and laws
which constitute andigovern animal organization.
The science is thus explained; and the phenomena and appearances, which may be invariably expected, may thus be generalized.
But the particulars and mnnutie will vary exceedingly, according to
the various dispositions and organizations upon which the magnetic
condition is induced. To particularize would require an indefinite
length of remark, consisting of individual observations and isolated
inductions.
A great questi6n now presents itself for investigation: Is there
such a th/inb existino as indelvndent clairvoyance?  I answer, There
is. You ask for proof. Such you shall receive by the following
investigations.
It is well, however, to understand the meaning which is applied to
the word independent. If you mean self-existent, abstract, indefinite,
and without any connexion —then the expression means nothing: for
in this sense there is no such thing as independence. But if the

word is intended to mean friee from  direct instigaltion, then it has
meaning; and to it this signification should be attached.  I am compelled at this time to explain and reveal the mental phenomenon as
[ experience it; and the reasoning to familiarize it to the mind will
be given hereafter.
It was admitted that the body is in negative subjection to its operato)r-and also that muscular and vital action are still sustained, yet
in a less degree of activity than during the self-possession of the
forces of motion.  The body so situated is dependent for its activity
upon one source, while the mind or the intellectual quality is dependent upon another.  While I am examining,* I am directly dependent upon the close connexion of the physical, and the steady and
intense cognizance of the mental. But when the independent condition or crisis is produced, the body assumes an inclined position.
lit becomes cold, rigid, and unsusceptible; and hearing and all the
physical organs are torpid and inactive. But when the body resumes
its natural position, hearing returns, muscular motion is commenced
and active, and the organ of speech is also in full exercise. Each
of these powers must be in operation in order to communicate externally what the natural organs are seemingly cognizant of.  This dependence is not what is termed sympathetic, but it is in reality a situation which that word will express. The medium existing between
thought and thought, between mind and mind, and between time and
eternity, is the only active pervading medium which I am dependent
on for the conception of thought, and for the perception of all things
of a refined, ethereal, or spiritual constitution.  This is while the
activity of the body and mind appears to be sympathetic or dependent. I am not impulsed or impressed by the thoughts or feelings
of a foreign person, though I am cognizant of them through the medium above termed ethereal. The independent condition is when
the body manifests the external appearance of rigidity, &c., above
described; and in tilis situation only is the term "independence"
applicable.
13. I will now illustrate the connexion between the internal,
through the organization, with the external; that is, what the mind
is dependent upon to generate ideas. Forms of all things make an
impression, or rather cast a reflection upon the mind, which reflection
is the idea. Sound of every kind conveys to the mind a peculiar

vibration - imperceptibly yet irresistibly undulates the portion of the
mind with which it comes in contact. This vibration is the idea.
The vibration and idea are simultaneous, yet perfect. Words (or
sounds which are called words) are the agent of ideas. So also
when a person meets or observes a form or substance, he necessarily
receives an idea concerning it. And the idea once created is irrevocable; and association of the mind with the form external, excites and
develops the idea first established. So also with sound or words.
Hence in learning/, a frequent repetition of the association of ideas is
necessary; and when the idea is established, the same sound or
word, even though irregularly or indefinitely repeated, renews it, and
thus confirms the knowledge through the faculty or medium termed
association or imitation.
All thoughts or ideas are thus dependent upon exciting causes,
the medium of which is but obscurely known. Yet every thought is
an unrestrained production of a mind acted upon by forms, reflections,
sounds, associations, or imitation.  All thoughts, in one word, may be
termed irresistible impressions. The cause of all such is invisible.
It is not the form, substance, sound, or word, that produces thought;
but it is the irresistible impression which such produce upon the
mind.  There is, first, the cause; secondly, the effect produced; and
thirdly, the thought, idea, or ultimate.  lTtought is dependent; mind
is indepezdent, not existing with the body as a component part of its
constitution, but is an ultimate of organization; and tholught is an ultimate of both.
Let it further be considered that a physical manifestation is not
produced until thought as a cause or prompter previously exists.
Let it also be considered, that an idea or thought could not be produced without the mind previously existing. And let it further be
impressed, that a mind could not be'individnzalized without the previous existence of the physical organization; and still further, that
the organization could not be constituted and established without its
previous and eternal elementary existence; and that this all could
not exist without a self-existent, unchangeable, and eternal Principle.
Here, again, is developed the principle previoufsly established: that
the visible and external are effects and ultimates of invisible yet real
producing causes.
In analyzing mind, it becomes necessary to admit what you at first
would doubt. If you say the mind is a principle belonging to, and
is produced and developed by, tile action of the organization, you at

the same time admit the production, and its existence; but if you do
admit and sanction this alone, then you virtually approbate and sanction a most ingenious theory: that all forms which possess within
themselves a moving force, are no less than thinking pinciples!  So,
then, to be consistent in your efforts to analyze your own mind, you
must admit a power beyond man's present power of investigation.
And if such a principle does exist (and you are compelled irresistibly to admit it), you may call it spirit, or substitute for that word any
other name which may alleviate an inward skepticism of a continuation of this principle's identity.
And by the admission of a Principle previously existing, adequate
in power and wisdom to produce organizations, and to disseminate
universally, life and vivacity, you positively deny the belief in the
annihilation of the most minute substance in existence. And by
prostrating the grounds of such a belief artificially sustained, there is
established in its stead the existence of an invisible yet unchangeable
Principle, which is previously admitted to be even more than a probable possibility. And while you have no possible means of refutation, just quiet the mind, until I reveal the situation in which my
mind is placed while observing, and receiving impressions which you
at this time have no possible means of arriving at.*
When the mind becomes free from the organization, and is launched
from its nidulated state, it passes into a new sphere of existence. Impressions of truth, of virtue, of principles which govern, control, and
actuate, tangible and physical substances, all converge to one Focus.
This I call the Fountain, the Sun, the Great Illuminator, the unchangeable, eternal POSITIVE M1IND!  This fills all negative substances.  Worlds, their forces, their physical existences, with their
life and forces, are all negative to this Positive Mind.  This is the
great Positive Power; all subordinate existence is negativc.  Both
positive and negative exist as a united, unchangeable Principle of all
action. For an illustration, let the mind conceive of a wheel, sphere,
or circle.  Let it be concentrated at the centre of this, and it will be
perceived that there is an expansion of circles from the centre to the
circumference, or that one wheel can not exist without another. And
so with the Great Positive and Negative, which compose one whole
Sphere of Existence. If these two forces produce all existence, do
they not from the centre expand to the circumference, passing through

minute and modified forms, until they pervade the Universe and constitute the powers of all things?  From  this Focus then I receive
impressions of the many and various principles and mediums which
exist between the mind and the objects to which it aspires. When
I pass into this sphere, I become associated with the spheres of the
persons or forms which it is the previous desire to associate with. I
do not pass to the Focus of all existence, but to the focus of this
existence-which is analogous to the expansion and centre of every
wheel of existence.  When I pass from  the body, it is not the distance-the indefinite space through which the mind proceeds, that is'
necessary to enable it to obtain its information; but it is the transition
or metamorphosis of the principle of mind to its second sphere of
existence.
~ 14. In a wheel, there is but owec centre: so at tlis Focus, there
is but one Principle, one united attribute of Goodness and Truth. If
it were possible for a circle to have several centres, then it would be
possible for various principles and truths, both good and evil, to emanate from this Source.  But as the first is impossible in a particular
sense, so the other is positively impossible in a general sense. As
the sun stands as an emblem of this great truth, you can not resist
the impression of its positive analogy.  The sun produces li/llt: it
can not produce darkness.  It is a focus for the universal diffusion
of light, and this it sends forth to the extreme sphere of its existence.
So this Centre is a Focus for the universal diffusion of Knowledge,
Truth, and one unchangeable principle, as disseminated to the extremne sphere of its positive power or existence.  The focus of this
existence is but an indefinite expansion of the Great Focus, passing
from general positive to general negative existence —and being the
controlling power of this existence, even as the Grceat Focus governs
all existences.  To this centre-to this focus —to the great positive power of this sphere (which is an effect or ultimate) —to this
great actuator and propeller, consisting of one principle, which is
Goodness without distinction —I go to receive information! And as
the mind generates thought by coming in contact with external exciting causes in the natural body; so this Mind* creates in my mind
parallel ideas which I term impressions.  And by the minute yet ex* All the inhabitants of' the second Sphere or World of human existence, are considered as united and forming one. The "M find" referred to, therefore, is the General Mind of the Second Sphere.

isting  medium between the mind and the body, I arrive back to
convey the impressions through the natural organization.
HIow little, therefore, is the evidence of reality to be observed in
corporeal manifestations! for while the phenomenon termed clairvoyance is visible as an ultimate, the real cause is invisible, and but faintly
evident to the senses.
The ultimate perfection of all substances, the ethereal existence
of spiritual spheres, and the means by which I receive impressions
are evident to me; but so greatly different from anything familiar to
the natural mind, acting through the organization, that it is impossible at this moment to make these things evident to your senses. But
I must reveal these things as the impressions are received: the parallel facts and inductive conclusions will be made evident to your
minds hereafter. And I must proceed to give the appearances of all
second spheres as they are to me manifested.
The human organization appears as a perfection and combination
of all substances below its exalted composition. It is controlled by
chemical and mechanical forces, and is a coating, a casement to contain its inward properties. There is another distinct principle, which
appears and is evident to me as Spirit.  Also there is a mnediator, or
medium connecting the spirit with the body. This mediator I know
as sensation.  And when this medium becomes disunited, there is a
physical dissolution, and a spiritual elevation to a different sphere of
existence; when the mind becomes connected with this sphere by a
medium similar to that which connects it with the body. It is then
identified with a personal sphere peculiar to itself, even as spheres
are peculiar to different organizations.
The manl is the internal of the body, occupying the organs as instruments for external communication; and when transferred, he retains
all the senses, in a spiritual condition.  And his mediums of communication are then spiritual, and he is susceptible to all properties
and elements that compose the existence of all things. He receives
impressions by these as exciting causes,-whichl are imperceptible to
the natural senses, but extremely evident and manifest to the spiritual
senses. And while the natural organization perceives substances and
appearances as artificial and external, the spiritual organization perceives the real and invisible-is susceptible to the action of all
existing properties through a sensation peculiarly belonging to its
nature.

TIHE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  43
When I pass off into the independent state of clairvoyance to receive impressions, I receive them as the knowledge of the reality (or
essence) of the substance which I had a previous desire to investigate.  And as it is a law of Nature which can not be reversed, that
positive is attractive to subordinate or negative substances, I must
pass to the positive sphere of this existence.  There I do not have
any counsellor or informer, but I receive the reality of what I request.
I do not observe entities as they would be nzaturally known to exist;
but I know the peculiar connexion existing between all ultimate
spheres of man. When passing from the organization, all natural
forms and substances appear closed from my view by a great shade
or mantle, when all above appears one broad and extensive light,
passing through all of the second spheres of existence. This light is
the medium of perception and association, which pervades the second
spheres, and unites them together, even as the a(tural spheres are
bound together. And when it was said that all shall know the truth,
this was spoken in reference to the ultimate of this life, or to the second sphere of future existence, for there the truth is known.  The
reality, the invisible, the real cause of all effects, are then known
and this knowledge makes us free.
15. The laws that govern Nature go on with a steady and un.
changeable progression.  They are not at any time retarded oi
accelerated.  Nothing can prevent the natural results of these laws.
They are established by one great Positive Power and Mind,-and
equalled by a negative or ultimate Equilibrium. Hence their continued and united forces, by the influence of which all things are actuated,
governed, and developed, and pass on in a steady process of progression. Every particle of matter possesses the same power which governs the whole Universe; and in each particle you see a representation and evidence of these divine laws.  Thus in the stone you may
see the properties of the soil; in the soil, the properties of the plant;
in the plant, the properties of an animal: in the animal you see Man,
— and in Man you can not sce, but you can feel, the immortal principle.
The free, unshackled spirit, then, should be considered as the essential principle belonging to the organization, that with one sympathetic chain, encircling all spheres of this existence, can receive
impressions instantaneously of all things desired, —and with its spirItual senses, communicate with spiritual substances.  And as a!'

these must be in a sphere necessarily attached to this sphere, it is
there that I receive my impressions.  I do not receive these from
the Great Supreme Mind, but from this second sphere, focus, or medium, which legitimately belongs to thtis globe alone. NWhen you
ask me a question, I am then existing in the medium or sphere of
the body; but in investigating and finding the answer, I pass to the
sphere where I can associate with the truth and reality.
It is impossible by words, to convey a full and adequate conception of the manner in which I arrive at truth.  I can only employ
such words as convey all the idea that words can convey, of this
process.  My information is not derived from any persons that exist
in the sphere into which my mind enters, but it is the result of a Law
of truth, emanating from the Great Positive Mind, and pervading all
spheres of existence.  By this, truth is attracted to, and is received
by, the mind.
It is impossible for any one to enter volultarily that state in which
he can view with clearness things belonging to a sphere of existence
higher than the natural world.  Were such a thing to take place,
that moment death would necessarily and inevitably ensue. For this
state can not be entered without a loss of one of the controlling forces
of the system; and if this force is not supplied by the system of another, the natural functions of the organization would cease, and the
spirit could not re-enter it after it had once departed.  Independent
clairvoyance, therefore, must be induced by the action of another system, by which the positive power is extracted from the subject. To
sustain life, this is silkpplied sympathetically by the system of the operator; and so long as this is the case, there is a rare and subtle medium of sympathy existing between the mind and the body, by which
the former finds its way back to the latter after a temporary absence.
If this medium were destroyed, the mind could not return; and it is
impossible to go voluntarily into the indep7endent state of clairvoyance
without destroying it.
To some, however, it is possible to go voluntarily into a state in
which the mind is greatly developed, and made cognizant of principles and truths pertaining to this mundane sphere.  This sometimes
happened with a well-known Grecian philosopher.*  During his
hours of slumber, he often received impressions which led him to extensive generalizations; and such was the source of those excellences in his works which have so long been the admiration of the world.
*Aristotle.

He was in the habit of wearing particular kinds of stones about his
person, imagining that these had the virtue of inducing this condition
of mind.
A celebrated orator* of the same country frequently went into the
same state of mind.  Some of his best impressions were received
during his hours of slumber. These he would subsequently systematize and carry out to their legitimate results: and the ability for
which he was distinguished may in a great measure be referred to
this source.
A distinguished ancient physiciant also received impressions in the
same way, which led him to analyzations of the properties of plants,
and to the discovery of their medicinal applications, which before had
been locked in secresy, and which must long have remained unknown,
independent of this source of discovery.
A similar mental phenomenon often happened in a still more perfect
degree with a noted Swedish philosopher and psychologist,* who
flourished within the last century.  His impressions were more extensive and distinct than those of either of the others to whom I have
referred; and by these means he was led to extensive generalizations
on the animal kingdom, which are true.  He also had visions of the
future state; but not being in independent clairvoyance, these were
not in all respects perfect. Yet to some extent they were true,and were valuable as being the best that could be received under the
circumstances.
Besides these, several Chinese and several Germans, and other
writers who have had the most influence upon the world, received
the leading ideas which characterize their works, in the same way.
Such impressions were of the same species with those which I receive, though theirs were received through a different medium, and
were measurably clouded by the organization.
To go into the future state, many people suppose that the mind
must depart to an indefinite distance firom the body, and assume a particular location.  This is not so.  Mathematically speaking, twofeet
from where I now sit is as much into the future state as any other
distance.  This consists simply in the condition which the mind assumes, and not necessarily in any change of its location.
Information concerning the things of which I speak in these discourses, is received while I am in this state of mind. For instance,
I know not now what I shall say the next moment, but must first'Demosthenes.          t Galen.          t Swedenborg.

pass off in search of thoughts and truths to be presented next in
order.
Furthermore, the mannecr in which I obtain my information, may
be compared to a process of chemical analysis. In analyzing a body,
the chemist separates its constituents until he has found its simple
elements. These are Trouth. It is by a process of spiritual analysis
that I obtain truth.  I pass from the body with a desire for a particular kind of information.  This desire attracts the particular kind of
truth of which I would be informed, separates it from all other things,
and causes it to flow into the mind. And when I thus obtain the
truth of which I am in quest, I return to communicate it through the
organization.
~ 16. Thus, though the transition of my inner life to its second
sphere, presents to the senses but little evidence of its reality, to
me it appears a metamorphosis analogous to death.  While the
senses observe the cessation of life, and the dissolution of the natural body, they have no tangible evidence of the real change which
the inner passes through.  But the latter itself is conscious of the
change.  The worm, while in its pupa state, passes through successive changes, till it arrives at the form, of the caterpillar.  W/4e can
see a further metamorphosis: the caterpillar knows not of it. The
butterfly is conscious of its former encasement.  The appearances
to the senses constitute one species of evidence, while the consciousCess of changing in the creature, constitutes another.  To the natural senses, the effect or phenomenon only is present: the cause is
foreign and seemingly disconnected. To me, both cause and effect
are present.  Forms and substances external are the subjects of
outer association; but their reality, internal, rarefaction or refinement,
is what I am associated with. The natural senses are cognizant of
corporeal and formal investiture; but when things pass into their
various progressive conditions, they are lost sight of.  Like the
zcater-which, while remaining as such, is perceived by the senses;
but, when it passes into steam, air, and the luminiferous ether —becomes rare and refined-the natural mind and senses lose the perception of its existence, and apply to it, as to all unparticled matter, the appellation of spirit, for the want of a better term to define
its condition. To me this all is known as matter become rare
and unparticled —as the ultimate of matter. to which is applied the
word slpirit.

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                    47
A natural tendency of the mind is to feel a conviction of its own
continuance and progression. This amounts to a belief, but not to an
absolute knowledge.  For no collection of particles or substances of
any kind, possesses the power of self-analyzation. Hence all above
the power of the mind may be received as a desirable conviction,
yet not a palpable reality. To me this reality is made perfect. lMy
perceptions and general impressions are from the ultimate or pcjfction of all material substances.  The scope of these perceptions and
impressions, comprehends the substance of the second Sphere in a
particular sense, even as it comprehends all in a general sense.
And as the result of present things is the substance of the second
Sphere, I in this Sphere have the perception of the things pre-impressed upon the mind to investigate.  Things appear real to me
which are beyond the reach of the natural organization, which knows
of nothing except what exists in matter and form.
To me the grosser matter is impelling the rare and refined; while
the rare and refined is pervading the grosser. Or, in other words,
forms and appearances are effects of matter in approximating to its
future state of perfection; while its perfected state, or ultimate, is
in return controlling and refining these substances and forms.  This
is illustrated by the fact that the atmosphere becomes purified by the
intervention of an ether or vapor.  Thus water, passing into vapor,
purifies the air contained in a room, in a particular way, as the same
refinement of water purifies the air in a general way.
All ultimates, to me, are still matter; but to you they are spirit.
These appertain to the second Sphere, or ultimate condition, which I
become associated with. As the natural senses are cognizant of
forms, the spiritual senses are cognizant of their ultimates.  Thus
a particle of matter, in its ultimate perfection, can not associate with
a grosser particle; but when the grosser progresses to its ultimate,
it becomnes an associate with other ultimates.  The rare acts on the
lower; but the lower can not act upon the rare. So with the mind
-with the senses: they can progress in their inward nature to their
unparticled or ultimate state; but the ultimate can not associate with
the senses.  So psychological theories are only based upon desires
of the mind, and convictions which it receives through the external
senses.
In the state in which I am placed, all things are in an exalted
condition; and this I am conscious of by arriving at the same ultimate sphere. An(l by association with these, and by inquiry and

analyzation of any given subject, I perceive the reality or ultimate
of the things visible to the natural senses; and with this impression
I arrive to associate in the organic sphere, and thus am enabled to
convey my impressions by words instinctively accompanying them.
And this explains the distinction and apparent contradiction between dependent and independent, as manifested in my own case.
For while I am off, I am independent of objects and forms external,
but dependent upon things interior, for the information which I receive. The impression is made upon my ultimate or inner principle,
this impression creates thought; this thought, when I return to the
body, brings up an association of words to express it, on which words
I am thus dependent.  Words are to me signs or sounds by which
impressions are conveyed to others.  All words, corporeal manifestations, muscular actions, the organs of the body, and such like, are
instruments or means of external communication; but the things
communicated, I am conscious of through a different agent or medium.  While receiving impressions, I am  a representation and
sinification of the second or future association belonging to man
and matter, or of their ultimate or perfected state.  I have no
means of directly convincing the understanding of this condition;
for, as was before mentioned, grosser matter can not associate with
more refined; but refined and perfected matter can and does associate with grosser.  So while you can not associate your impressions
with mine, I can associate my impressions with yours, yet not distinctly, evidently, or consciously to yourself-any more than grosser
matter is conscious of its pervading unparticled matter or moving
principle. To make the understanding analogically convinced of
the ultimation of matter termed spirit, it is necessary to commence at
the beginning of all things formal and rudimental, and trace them
evidently and naturally to their ultimate perfection.
My impressions of spheres, or of matter in its second or ultimate
stage of progression, are received in a way analogous to the natural,
butby virtue of a perception much more exalted!  But ultimates
are no more than finite to me, as they appear in a particular sense
finite to you, but in a general sense infinite.  As the natural ideas
are associated with matter in its gross and perfected state, it appears
limited; while to me the whole appears unlimited, evident, and is
present with all its features and representations of cause and effect.
Thus the human body shows both the grossness and perfection of
matter.  The grosser composes the bones; its progression produces

nerves and all secondary formations of flesh and filaments; while the
ultimate produces the -skin and hair.  So with the blood: it passes
from its grosser state of coagulation to the refined state, when it becomes fitted for deposition and reproduction; and it becomes more
and mnore rare and refined until it escapes the body in insensible perspiration. So with the moving power, or volition: while the grosser
is active in moving the muscular fibre, its refinement and perfection
constitutes the thinkcing princi ple-which becomes so refined that it
constantly escapes in thoughts or ultimates of which the mind is the
originator.  Thus the finer pervades the coarser; but the coarser can
not pervade, but is approximating to, the finer; and when it arrives
at its ultimate state, it becomes an associate with that which has previously arrived at the game general condition.
So with my inner life or ultimate sphere: it associates with the
ultiinates or realities of all grosser substances; and by such a connexion, traces subjects analytically yet instantaneously from cause to
effect; and this supplies me with the knowledge which to your minds
and understanding bears the impress of being derived from direct supernatural and spiritual intercourse —while to me the word " supernaturral" has no meaning.  All natural things can not produce supernat&ral; but this term is only applied to effects when their causes are ne
evident.
Through such impressions, all things soughit for appear present
The knowledge of the mnodus operandi of the Universe, from. generals
to particulars, is present with me.  All this comes instinctively
through an impressive connexion with matter and ultimates. Theseprinciples instinctively perceived, to me appear recalities, and all
things else as supemificial.*  So this instinctive perception of trutlh
enables me to communicate the knowledge of the second Sphere
through the organization, to the external world.  You may term this
an expansion of the mind; a quickness of perception; an, exalted
condition of the imagination. You may doubt its real truth; you
may question the existence of the principle of which I speak; but
you will not, if you consider the position which the true reasoner and
philosopher ~sustains.

and profession. A disposition like unto this is not in a state to receive
truth, or to progress in knowledge; and when the transition or metarmorphosis occurs from this sphere to a future one, such a mind will
not be refined and progressed to its ultimate condition.  It will be
like the second refinement of matter; and hence will take a long time
to progress to its legitimate ultimate —and then it will associate in:the spheres of those who have arrived at the state of perfection previously. The mind exalted before it assumes its second body or
sphere, is so much progressed toward its ultimate state; and it will
be associated with knowledge which subordinate or less-refined minds
can not appreciate or enjoy.
~ 17. Thus grosser matter, or rudimental beings, and their progression until they arrive at their ultimate perfection, are in correspondence with mind and its progress to its ultimate sphere. Their
many spheres and associations are only such as mark the natural refinement or progression of all things.  Intellectual progress com-:mences in the body or first individualization: thence the mind goes
onward through its many stages of knowledge, corresponding to the
various stages of its ultimate progression.
It is a law of Matter to produce its ultimate, Mind.  It is the law
of mind to produce its corresponding principle, Spirit.  It is the nature of Spirit to progress in knowledge and understanding relative to
the cause, of which all things else are the effects.  Knowledge in its
nature corresponds to Truth: Truth represents light and peace; and
the acquisition of these two produces the enjoyment which a lover
of truth appreciates in this sphere, vWhile he anticipates and will re-,ceive the same enjoyment in future.
All things in forms and corporeal investiture, which exist upon the
face of the earth as displaying life, are correspondents of their inner
life or principle-which not only actuates them to thriftiness, but is
working, by an undeviating law, the refinement of all subordinate
substances: and these visible, corporeal manifestations also stand in
analogy with the ultimation of their inner and living principle, which
by influx produces rudimental sensation in the organic system, and
becomes a part of animal existence.  So, tracing the refinement of
matter from vegetable to animal existence (the life or soul of plants

naturally and reasonably at an idea of the future properties, the posi
tively individualized condition and existence of the mind in its first
ultimate state of progression.*  Admitting this much, you arrive at
the condition of existence in which my mind is placed.
Admit mind and its future identity-and you then can conceive
of thought being irrevocable, and existing in repetition and association with the form, or cause of its production. Individual perception
establishes this truth: That a thought once produced, never requires
reproduction: but it is only necessary to associate the mind with the
cause of its first development, to renew or refresh its action.  Mind,
therefore, corresponds to a fulcrum, upon which operates the lever of
producing thought, which revolves, in its action, the principles and
associations of ideas which thoughts seek to conceive. Then a repetition of thoughts once produced, creates as an ultimate, or effect,
accompanying new ones.
Each of these laws of matter and mind stands as a representation
of what is future; and an admission of the foregoing presses upon the
mind, as an irresistible conclusion, the probability of its natural and
ETERNALt PROGRESSION!
Facts have thus been presented in illustration of the condition and
sphere of my inner life, to make it evident to the senses as corresponding to the sphere which you are now in, and to enable you to
receive the truth by analogy. Being compelled to admit the visible
facts, you are equally constrained to admit as probable, a correspondent or ultimate Sphere.  Conclusions arrived at by independent
processes are an evidence of its reality; though by no process of investigation now known, have you the means to prove demonstratirely
the sphere which I am  at this time associated in.  Therefore receive impressions favorable to its truth; for such impressions answer
as a guide to your future progress in knowledge and truth.
I am now compelled by a reasonable demand of the subject to expIlain the cause of several paticulalr phenomena which sometimes
present themselves in the state of the physical system induced by
magnetism, and its ultimate, known as clairvoyance.
There are times when I, apparently to the senses, do not receive
vision or impressions. This, being a particular phenomenon or effect,
requires an adequate explanation.  When progressed to the condi* In a subsequent part of this work this subject is unfolded and illustrated in such
a way as to insure a thorough and correct understanding.

tion or state known as completely demagnetized (which is invariably
induced), physical causes incidental to the external system, sometimes indirectly interfere with the medium of sensibility. This medium being disqualified from particularly and internally attaching the
mind to the body, prevents occasionally the free expansion or transition of the mind, and its intimate connexion and necessary attachment
to the organization. When this occurs (and it can not be perceived
by the senses), impressions can not be received, because the mind
has not become thoroughly independent.
Again: The expression " I see," which I frequently use in familiar conversation during examinations of various descriptions, would,
literally understood, convey a wrong impression.  If I should use
any other term, you would not understand its signification. This
expression naturally conveys the idea of vision -of an optical knowledge of a foreign substance. In reality the expression simply conveys the idea of knowing by a peculiar process; for the knowledge
of a foreign substance is obtained through the imperceptible reflection
which the substance casts upon the retina. So it is knowledge, sight
being simply a process to convey inward the existence of the outer.
Hence if the expression "I know," were ordinarily used (which
would be correct), I would use the same to give the impression of
what I know, independently of optical or other processes of rudimental perception.  Therefore, " I see," means, simply, " I know."  I
know of things by the process explained in the foregoing remarks;
and all phraseology which characterizes my conversation, is adapted
to, and corresponds with, your present sphere of perception and understanding.
These last phenomena, which are sometimes manifested, and are
occasions of impressing wrong conclusions,,are explained as being
particulars which can not be depended upon. Particulars and minutiae correspond to incidentals; and you naturally repose no confidence in the invariable repetition of these things. Generals are
always manifest, corresponding with truth and inward reality. Hence
it is again necessary to impress the conclusion, that generals can be
depended upon as inevitably manifesting inward truth and invisible
corresponding causes. But particulars and minutice can not be relied
on as producing the same unchangeable effects: for they stand in correspondence with incidental intervening circumstances which are
always necessarily of a subordinate character

18. In bringing my remarks on Animal Magnetism and Clairvoyance to a close, it would not be inappropriate to recapitulate the
arguments adduced to prove the phenomena. All that I have said
upon this subject, has been said without reference to any particular
axioms, or facts presumed to be admitted, or dependence upon any
manner or form of belief that may exist.
First: The magnetic state was proved to be a further development and extension of the motive powers of organic life; and it was
shown that the propelling forces that control one system in sensation,
life, health, and enjoyment, could be united to another system, and
both become as one- that, according to the laws which govern animal existences of a positive nature with reference to their negatives,
the magnetic state could be produced by a transferation of the forces
of the two.
Secondly: It was shown that all states between the first magnetic
state and perfect vision, are analogous to phenomena witnessed in the
various conditions of natural sleep and somnambulism; that the transition of the inner principle to the second Sphere, corresponds to that
painful metamorphosis termcsd deatct; and that the connexiQn existing between the inner life, or mind, and the organization, is a medium
analogous to that existing between one thought and another, familiarly understood as the power of concentration.
Thirdly: That the source of the impressions which I receive, exists in, and corresponds with, the second Sphere, or the ultimate of
thZis sphere, and which corresponds to this; and that the knowledge
which I receive, is obtained by associating with the causes which lead
the mind instantaneously to their effects. Cause and effect, thus presenting themselves almost at the same moment, give me the power
of analyzation from generals to particulars.
Therefore what has been said regarding these things, and the reasons for reposing credence in them, is not founded upon hypotheses,
or facts admitted, but it is a tracing of general truths to their corre
sponding ultimates; proving evidently and carefully these phenom
ena as not being a perversion of the laws of Nature. The whole is
thus made too evident to require the word supernatural; too reasonable and manifestly true to be, by a truth-loving mind, doubted!
Still the whole is submitted to the analyzation of minds which it has
been analyzing. And as it was admitted that no principle possesses
the power of self-analyzation, you will doubtless arrive at the point
familiarly established, that Truth is Truth in cvery law, from that

which governs the most minute atom in existence, to that which propels and actuates the planetary system. —And you are not to admit
some of the premises to be evident and truthful, and consider the remtainder as requiring a greater extension of credulity than you feel
responsible to exercise.
But you admit one truth which stands at the basis of all these-.he motive power of life and volition. In this your faith is established: the rest, then, you can not disbclicev for the want of the
amount of evidence necessary to prove them untrue. But if you
either doubt or sanction the truthfulness of this explanation, without
previously and seriously weighing the arguments for and against, neither your approbation nor disapprobation can be considered as legitimate.
Magnetism and Clairvoyance and their various phenomena being
traced, by evident facts, to their ultimate effect, which is an opening
of the second Sphere, they were left there; and the science of correspondences was adduced in their favor.  The first train of reasoning
consisted in investigating facts, and analyzing realities to obtain their
conclusions. The second train consisted in presenting analogous
truths, agreeing with the visible and terrestrial, and ascending to the
invisible and celestial. A third train of proofs is that which for distinction may be called representation; showing that facts represent
Truth, and- that truth is a representative of knowledge and intellectual progress: and that these all are representations of each other,
including the subject to be established.*
First: Matter corresponds to Life, or the law of activity.  Matter
and life correspond to production and reproduction. These correspond to, and represent the existence of plants. The small plant or
herb stands as a representative of the largest tree; and all these correspond to animals. The smallest species in animal existence, stands
as a representative of the most perfect animal organization.  The least
atom that goes to compose this existence, is a representative and signification of the largest globe or sphere existing in the Universe.
Once more: The inhaling of the Vegetable Kingdom, and the life
which it possesses-its Soul-corresponds to, and is a representative' When the author speaks of one thing as " representing" or " corresponding" to
another, he, in general, means that the one thing, indicates, points to, or shadows
forth, the existence of the other. The distinction which the author makes between
truth band fact, in the above sentence, and in other places, is the same as that which
exists between cause and effect, or law and its manifestation.





## p. 55 (#83) ##############################################


THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                   6
of, the influx and reflux of the same principle in animal existence.
Life in the Vegetable Kingdom, represents life and sensation in the
Animal Kingdom. In the least of animal existences there is seen a
law to govern them in reproduction, activity, and in sustaining their
own existence. And there is another peculiar manifestation of this
law, which is termed.instinlct. This instinct represents, and corresponds with, the mind of man.  The forces that act upon the least
particle of matter, presenting positive and negative manifestations, are
representative of that great eternal Positive and Negative Principle
which governs all matter. The mind of man represents the Great
Mind.  Thus facts which have been presented in the foregoing, are
one step beyond the argument of correspondences.
Is not the first train of reasoning admitted?  Is not the second
also true as harmonizing with facts first established? Is not the third
also admissible? When considering their relative bearings from first
facts to ultimate realities, does not the first adequately explain the
second?  Does not the second confirm the first? Does not the third
correspond with both, and stand as a representative of Truth?  If
so, will you let Truth stand as a representative of your intellectual
progress?
1.9. The science of representatives being thus developed and
established by a consideration of general truths and visible realities,
the application of this science will be necessary to further confirm
the proofs deduced in previous argument, of a transferation of spheres,
or transition of inner life. First: The healthy and powerful man,
equal in all the forces of his body, represents the connexion of two
bodies, or the unity of their positive and negative forces which makes
the two correspond to one. Secondly: The extreme sensibility and
acuteness of the perceptive powers, or the medium unconsciously
existing upon the nerves, and which, independently of external disturbing causes, excites upon the mind thlounght, corresponds to the
phenomenon of dreaming, or the peregrinations made by the mind
during the hours of repose.  Thirdly: the extension, transferation,
or transition, of the mind from this to another sphere, represents the
disconnexion of the mind from the body at the period of physical
dissolution. The moment of independence, which is during the apparently stiffened condition of the body, its inclined position and
appearance of sleep, represents death. The medium which connects
the mind, or second sphere, with the body, or this sphere, represents





## p. 56 (#84) ##############################################


66               THIE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
the medium  which exists between thought and thought, between
cause and effect, between general and particular truths, causes invisible and effects visible. It is the same that exists between all particular things relative to matter and mind, being imperceptible to the
sight, hearing, taste, and smell, but perceptible to the'feeling.
Again: First, facts have been presented; secondly, established
truths corresponding with facts; and thirdly, representation - sustaining the two former by appeals made to visible and external truths, independent of belief or disbelief. These becoming manifest, not only
establish facts as corresponding with facts, but the first two confirm
the last, and the last represents and confirms all. All this is positively sustaining the truth which was first apparently presumed to
exist in the phenomenon termed Clairvoyance.
The amount.of evidence is now before you on which may be
grounded your faith, or rather confidence, in that which is to come.
But if it is not sufficiently overwhelming to your minds as evidence
to establish faith, you must admit the following by affirming the questions propounded: If what has been said does not correspond with
your preconceived opinions and admitted theories, or is not agreeable to your present desires and feelings, does it it not nevertheless
correspond with Truth?   If what has been said relative to the
grounds of true reasoning does not associate itself with your present
mode of reasoning, does it not correspond with truth and invisible
realities as manifested in external effects, and thus explain theories
which you have long fostered as true? If what has been developed
relative to the science of Magnetism and its ultimate, Clairvoyance,
does not appear reasonable for you to believe, does it not appear
more unreasonable to disbelieve it?  If what I have stated in reference to the second Sphere, or the source of my impressions, does not
correspond with what you regard as truths evident to your senses,
does not all that I have revealed in candor, consecutiveness of investigation, and freeness of expression, commend itself favorably to your
minds? Even if the propositions presented appear at first the opposite of truth, does not the investigation-the close development of
forms, series, associations, correspondences, representations-yea,
the strict analysis of all these —manifest truth and sincerity corresponding to that Great Focus of Positive Truth, to which all things
else are subordinate?

4 20. IN the progress of this Key to the Revelation, and in familiarizing the truths and principles to be unfolded, with the present
sphere of reasoning, as to make plain and demonstratively evident
all things invisible as associating with, and corresponding to, things
which are known to exist —it becomes highly important to investigate the main attributes and various developments of matter. As it
is known in forms, from the animal and vegetable down to the mineral and earthy, and in the many modifications which it assumes, it
is generally believed to be totally disconnected from all principles of
intellect, or spiritual and inner life.
MIany opinions have existed relative to the motion of matter, and
its "vis inertia."  It is evident that the foundation upon which the
prevailing theories and hypotheses have been based, is laid in a misconception of the true mode of reasoning-taking some visible forms
and manifestations of Nature as moving, and some as not moving;
and taking one as an established principle of truth, and the other as
a probable reality: or assuming that inertia was a law of matter, when
the contrary might have been evidently demonstrated in various ways.
Nature and her forms present more evidence in favor of a ceaseless and unchangeable motion in matter than otherwise.  There is no
such thing existing as positive inertia in matter.  It is not particular
in what way matter is developed; it is not particular whether activity
in any form of matter is directly manifest to the senses or not —activity in such nevertheless does exist; for uniiversal nmotioT  may be
demonstrated as a general and positive law of Nature. Then why
take particulars and minutice in evidence of the opposite?
Matter possesses within itself the positive and negative motion, and
the specific essence of Life and Sensation.  Some philosophers have
supposed that matter contains within itself the principles of Motion,
Life, Sensation, and Intellect-regardless of any distinction in the
organisms or modes of these various principles.  Their reasonings
are based upon the known existing principle in matter, Sensation;
and they have endeavored to prove by this development that a further perfection and refinement in matter would produce Mind or
Spirit, independent of any absolute change or distinction in the organization of inherent Motion. It will be proved, however, that this
is not the case.  The great distinction between Life and Sensation
has never been named or properly understood in philosophical and

fci8           THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
pshilogical disquisitions.  But as this refinement of matter, termed
spirit, is not the proper subject to speak about at this time, I will
proceed to speak of the Motion and Laws which govern the material
Universe.
If there is a principle of iner'tia existing in Matter, then man possesses the power to create; but if there is not such a thing existing,
then man has merely the power of developingg.  One or the other of
the above must necessarily be true. Preponderance of evidence, as
connected with individual and external experience, must decide
which is.
The most apparently immoveable substance known in creation is
that of stone; and the question has often been asked, " Does stone
form and develop itself like unto other forms in Nature?"  In answvering this question, it is necessary to understand the relation and
distinction existing between the form and composition of matter in
tile stone, and the nature and composition of the form that interrogates. For if the stone were composed of the same principles and
possessed the same movements with the subject which is investigating its properties, the answer would be immediately evident. But
instead of this, though the composition of the stone is of itself active,
the action is so slow and imperceptible, in comparison to the quick
activity and changeableness of man, that he arrives at the conclusion
that the stone is inactive, while his body is active.
That a living and moving principle exists even in stones, is rendered evident to the senses by the appearance on their surface of
decomposition and decay.  Where decomposition takes place, recomposition must also occur; for matter is indestructible.  Therefore
rocks and stones give particles to, and take them from, other bodies.
Also when mines are found not so thoroughly developed as the geologists or miners expected to find them, they often leave them to
grow, germinate, or " get ripe," as they express it. Does not this
afford external evidence of the activity of matter?
And could man constantly unite with his body substances and
matter which are not active, or which do not possess a living principle?  Food is constantly taken; it is active upon the body; it becomes a part of the texture and substance of the system-is subjected to the physiological operations, and is governed by the same
mutual motive forces that pervade all things. If matter were inactive, could it be associated with activity? Can motion and rest
exist together?

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                   59
Chemists who have instituted investigations relative to matter and
motion, will tell you that one substance will unite with another of
like affinity; but they go no further.  But if )artticular matter wilt
only associate with that of like affinity, how is it that four or five elements are often found to exist in one composition?  The truth is,
there is a mutual affinity existing between all forms and substances
throughout Nature, including the mineral, vegetable, and animal
kingdoms. There is a constant fluctuation of all these, from, to,
and through each other, acting fast or slow according to the development of the matter sustaining these mutual actions.  There is a constant and unchangeable movement throughout all Nature, produced
by the ultimate of matter, or what is now known to be its inherent
properties of life and sensation.  There is a constant, undeviating
action, which produces and reproduces all forms visible and external.
Composition, decomposition, recomposition, visible and invisible, are
evidently performing their natural yet ceaseless work, according to
established laws. Earth and atmosphere form and compose vegetable existence; and these three, in their united and energetic forces,
compose their ultimates, the higher degrees of matter known as animal existence.  And this last constantly gives to, and takes from, all
things below its existence.  Hence there is a ceaseless and endless
chain of formation and reproduction; loss and gain; accumulation
and dispersion, taking place yearly, hourly, and secondly, throughout
the Universe. If there is an infected place upon the body, such as
a sore or wound, you may see, in its action of healing, a representation of all Nature. You may there see the perfect operation of the
two principles or forces of the anatomical and material system. What
is decomposed, will be gradually repulsed from the wound; what
has formed pure and healthy, by a fresh ultimation and composition
of particles, is gradually and carefully deposited at the place where
it is required.  There is not one particle too much or too little; but
the whole sustains an harmonious and united action in forming anew
the parts, and repulsing the extraneous and decomposed substances,
until the whole is united as before!  So with all Nature: every particle of matter being governed by these laws and forces, produces
harmony and union in all parts of existence. With an undeviating
tendency, each particle in Nature proceeds to its destined spot, there
to form what is required, or to become more refined to produce its
grand effects and sublime ultimates!
Thus all things have mutual affinities, yet these are not alway'

60               TIIE  PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
perceptible; for some substances and elements have progressed too
far to associate visibly with that which has not arrived at a similar
condition. The analysis and knowledge of the real principles (which
are invisible), governing even the atoms of existence, would teach a
lesson of truth in reference to the laws and movements of all things.
For the least substance in existence contains within itself the specific
forces and essences that exist in the remotest sphere in immensity.
Matter in its present, not only represents matter in its ultimate state,
but it is typical of Intelligence, or spiritual ultimation, throughout
eternity.
~ 21. In speaking of the origin and primitive Cause of all life, it is
necessary to sustain the- position to be assumed, by inductions drawn
from Nature and her laws.
First: If man is an animated being, and the earth inanimate, how
can these exist together?  If man is formed as an extraneous substance, separate from the great mass, how can he take from, and give
to, the elements that compose his, and other existences?  If motion
or life existed in one part of Nature, and repose in another, could
these two be made to characterize a Universe? Or can activity and
rest exist in one substance? If, on the contrary, motion is manifest
in the general departments of the Universe, is it not more than probable that all things are active, either in a visible or invisible way?
Thetmotive power of all life and activity in Nature, must be a part
of the same. It must exist with it, for it can not separately act upon
it. Motion is then coexistent, coessential, and coeternal with Nature.
It acts on all matter in a greater or less degree of perfection; and
consequently there is not a particle or substance in Nature in an inactive condition, but all things are full of life and energy.
It is not necessary to explain the formation of this sphere at this
time, but only to investigate matter and motion as evidently manifested to the senses. IMlotive Power, existing with Matter indivisibly, is the cause of Life; and to distinguish Motion, Life, and Sensation, from Intelligence, there must be a correspondence shown as
existing universally, representing these principles as Motion in a
greater or less degree of perfection. What is known as Motion, is
not properly Life; for Motion exists where Life does not.
The harder substances, such as mineral and stone, are apparently
motionless; but still they are continually decreasing or increasing,
according to their peculiar states of perfection. For mineral bodies





## p. 61 (#89) ##############################################


THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  61
are formed by the association and action of such elements as enter
into their composition. WVhen they commence forming, they are iv
a crude and unrefined state; but by the activity and motion which
characterize them, they constantly extract from other substances, particles for their own composition. And as that which has progressed
to a condition to enter into such a formation, associates with, and becomes a part of, the mineral, so all which has not progressed to the
proper state to associate with the same, is repulsed and separated as
dross and extraneous matter; and this associates with that of like affinity, even as did the former.
Particles may accumulate from the combined elements in the interior of the earth, to form what is termed ore.  And this can not
remain inactive when it is formed, but progresses to metal. Then it
possesses no visible motion or activity.  But time will develop its
slow, yet perfect action: for rust will be seen accumulating on its
surface, and finally the whole becomes dissolved and disunited, and
passes into other substances of like and equal affinities.  In this,
therefore, is seen a perfect illustration of the steady motion existing
as an invisible reality.
The appearances of forms and substances would almost give the
impression that they exist as independent of earth and atmosphere;
for the question could with propriety be asked, If animal and vegetable existences belong to and are a part of earth, why are they not all
like earth? or, why is not earth like unto them?
The distinction is not properly made between substances which
are constantly progressing to specific states of perfection and association. A peculiar kind of earth is perfected, and has the essential
property of associating with, and forming mineral; while, by a long
and imperceptible progression, earth and minerals associate with and
form vegetable existence.  By a gradual progression and refinement
particles of the mineral and vegetable kingdoms are rendered capable
of becoming the substance of animal organization. And there is between earth and animal existence, a general and particular correspondence, —and there are intermediate associations of matter, grosser
or more refined, which produce the various substances and forms
existing between each of these kingdoms.
In earth and minerals, and all matter which is commonly said to be
in repose, there is existing the primitive and original principle inseparably belonging to and characterizing the whole Universe. There
is motion in these, developing power in its action such as man is not





## p. 62 (#90) ##############################################


62              THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
capable of comprehending; for man, with all his powers of intelligence combined, is not competent to investigate and properly comprehend the force and moving power of his own existence. Yet in
grosser matter, there is contained the primitive and essential principle
of Motion; and this is the first of all powers existing in Matter
throughout the Universe. Life does not exist in such forms, yet this
is a specific and essential quality belonging to Motion; but one which
can not yet be developed, for the want of a higher and more perfect
state of material existence.
~ 22. For illustration, imagine this sphere as existing, and nothing
of what is now known as vegetable and animal forms.-Let matter
be destitute of any higher state of perfection than the grosser substances which compose this sphere only. Then, if you are in a condition
to be cognizant of all motion, which is incessantly going on among the
various atoms and particles, you have the principle of Motion primitivrly existing. You would not know of a principle of Life or Sensation. Your mind could not extend to vegetable and animal creation,
for such you would think were utterly impossible. But suppose you
still continue in the condition to be cognizant of the progression and
continual motion universally existing: you would next see the formation of minerals. You would consider these as forming from the progression and ultimate refinement of grosser matter. Yet no combination of numbers would express to the understanding the number
of years intervening between the first or rudimental stages of Matter
and the formation of minerals.
Next, you would see plants germinating and springing up, of a
diminutive size, over the face of creation. HIere again is a substance
manifested which you did not know as existing previously to its formation. Yet by a steady perception, you could see that it was evidently the progression of matter that produced such an accumulation
of particles to form a Vegetable Kingdom. There would be also a
new development of the law of Motion. You would here see Life in
every particle of vegetable existence, a principle which you did not
know as existing previously to the formation of the substances in
which it is developed. Yet it would be evident that this Life is an
essential quality and development of the first principle of Motion.
Intermediate formations would gradually be produced; and a long
series of years would elapse between the formation of the last Kingdom and the production and development of another. You would next





## p. 63 (#91) ##############################################


THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                 63
see animals existing in minute and delicate forms, corresponding with
the minute and delicate forms of plants. From these there would be
gradually created higher degrees of animal organization, corresponding with the higher vegetable existences, until you would observe
(the qualities and particles becoming so perfect from the ultimation
of the grosser matter) the formation and production of the magnificent
and wonderful mechanism of the humann form, comprising within
itself the ultimate properties of all previously existing matter, and
which stands as an ultimate and combination of all else existing anterior to its creation!
Thus you have seen matter pass from its grosser condition, through
its many stages and spheres of progression, until it arrives at consequent animal organization!
There is another principle also developed, corresponding with the
perfection of matter. You first saw Matter and Motion; secondly,
you saw its gradual progression until it formed substances capable of
developing a new principle of motion. This was Lfe, corresponding
in perfection to the forms which contained it. Then, again, you knew
of no other principle existing besides Motion and L/fe: but, in due
time, new forms were produced by the same unchangeable laws of
progression and association, corresponding to, and capable of developing, a new principle of Motion and Life, which was Sensation.
Then you saw that Sensation was a further development of the essential properties of Motion-that the former contained the latter, but
could not manifest it without corresponding forms of progressed matter, capable of producing such a development.
You are now convinced that the physical organization of Man is an
ultimate of matter, and an effect produced by an internal, invisible, yet
eternal Cause: and you are further convinced that Sensation, Life,
and Motion, are consequent qualifications of the organic constitution.
You have observed the gradual progress of all things until Mlan
was formed. You may now be removed from the position which
you have occupied as being raised above this sphere, for the purpose
of observation, —to direct your attention to the beings which you
have patiently seen formed. And now, existing and moving among
other forms and beings like unto yourself, are you capable of comprehending and explaining what you evidently saw as manifest to
your senses while thus situated? You are not: for you are now
dwelling in a sphere lower than that which you previously occupied,





## p. 64 (#92) ##############################################


64              THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
and therefore can not associate with the same. Nor can you associate
with this sphere fully; for you are not only one among millions of
forms, but you are apparently self-existing, and isolated from the
great mass of universal production.
You now see that man possesses something besides Life and Sensation. And it is for the want of a capacity to make a proper dis-,tinction, that you confuse Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelligence,
in one form, and sanction the theory that Intelligence is a result of
organization. The cause, then, of your belief is evidently demonstrated.-It is for the want of a higher sphere to enable you to associate with that which belongs to your present sphere. But becoming
confused in investigating your own composition, you arrive at the
conclusion that the principle of mind is eternal, yet not individualized, or associating identically with spheres of ultimate progression,
as corresponding with the spheres which you have demonstrated to
your senses in the earthy, mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms,
with their minutiae and intermediates, -and in primitive Motion, Life,
Sensation, and Intelligence.
And in this place it is necessary to impress again the proposition,
That no substance or power of any character, whether physical or
intellectual, possesses within itself the power of self-investigation or
comprehension. Therefore you can comprehend and trace, analogically and correctly, grosser substances to the formation of yourselves;
but you arrive at Mind, Intelligence, Spirit, —and though this is the
principle which has enabled you to explore and comprehend all below it, you find that this itself is necessarily vague and indefinite to
you. And hence there is either too much belief as respects this
principle and its composition, or too much disbelief; and each is a
natural consequence of a principle attempting to investigate itself.

nebulous matter, or in other words, a Centre produced by a conglomeration of particles, must of necessity be a body, crude, heterogeneous,
yet a cause. Its inherent forces are spontaneously producing effects,
and these effects are necessarily producing ultimates.  It exhibits
also the inherent principle in matter known as Motion, which is
admitted to be coexistent with matter itself, —producing effects,
which effects are producing ends or ultimates.  Such an incipient
bormation is the only basis on which can rest a proper understanding
of the potency of matter and the excellency of ultimates.
The correspondential reasoning to be instituted is based upon generals and universals —or upon the Cause which is perpetually producing effects and ends. Intermediate and isolated divisions are not
essential to a proper investigation of terrestrial laws.
There is an invisible Cause producing spontaneously external
Effects; and these may be divided into series, degrees, and reprcsentationzs.  At first, Matter and Motion existed: and these formed
one series. Vegetable production and its essential developments
and accompanying life, are a second form and degree.  Animal organization is a third development, or an ultimate of the inward or finsa
Cause: and its kingdom  is a third form  and degree,-the whole
forming three series.  First, Matter, spontaneously producing and,
reproducing Ends or Ultimates.  Secondly, Motion, graduated- andti
developed according to the perfection and utilization, of matter into_
forms, suitable as agents, and perfect as ultimates, to, dexvelop its
inward principle to the external sphere.  Again (for a more particular distinction), first, Matter; secondly, perfect degree of, vegetable
existence; and thirdly, matter in animal organization as its highest
state.  These are three series or degrees.  Secondly, Motion as a.
coexisting principle with Matter, Life as an. effect, and Sensation as
an ultimate or end: constituting three series or degrees of5 the progression of matter and its inherent motion, —or of the development
of the great Cause internal, which progresses to, and produces ex —
ternal and visible forms.  These classifications must be understood,
in order to arrive at the corresponding principles which are still invisible, yet creating infinite. ends and ultimates, from eternal; invisible.
and potent laws of causation.
For an understanding of the reasonings which may properly be
based upon these classifications, according to the science of corre —
spondences, familiar and physiological illustrations may be presented.

Tharts by which internal causes may be arrived at.  For forms and
effects are representatives in a higher degree, of what is existing in a
lower or first degree; and the substance of ultimates is a develop~
inent and-progression of all beneath its sphere of existence, and is a
compound of all substances, refined and rarified to a sphere of ultimate perfection.  Consequently it involves all of the lower orders of
spheres and existences. Hence it acts on, and subsists upon, substances and particles which compose the original elements of its nature.  All beneath an ultimate, or an effect, thus su)2plies the effect
and ultimate; and hence ultimates or effects correspond to, and represent all things in an inferior degree and sphere of perfection.
Thus, the human body is a composition of all else:-but to familiarize it with the understanding as corresponding with universals in
Nature, an examination of its laws and functions generally, and a
classification of them  in series and degrees, will be necessary: and
this will manifest the doctrines which it is necessary to enforce.
First, theform is a representative of Matter originally existing.: for
lhe system is formed by laws not distinctly comprehended, even as
is the great system of the Universe.  There is an invisible, an internal cause, existing in the human form; and there is an external, an
ultimate, an end also.  These two are generals; but there are other
specific qualities and essences, producing distinct results; -- and a:classification of these is necessary in order to make them familiar to
the mind, as corresponding with distinct departments in Nature.
First, the head, secondly, the chest, and thirdly, the abdomen.'These are the three orders of degrees in the same form, arising out
of the general, as the original basis.  The head is the cause, the
chest, the effect, the abdomen, the end, or ultimate. Or, the head,
as a cause, involves, acts on, and produces all which the organism
usually manifests.
Still more plainly is this principle illustrated and represented in
the functional operations of the viscera, in forming that essence of
organic life, the blood.  First, the mouth, tongue, and its mucous
surfaces; secondly, the stomach; and thirdly, the termination of
the same in the small and large intestines.  Or, the saliva, the
gastric juice, the pancreatic and hepatic, or bile.  The saliva is the
cause, and performs the essential office of preparing the food for the
stomach.  Saliva produces an effect or immediate result, called gastric juice, which is the same juice developed and potentialized to
perform its grand end or ultimate.  Its termination is the active and





## p. 67 (#95) ##############################################


THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                   67
finely-secreted fluids of the small and large intestines, terminating at
the rectum.  Hence the element known as blood commences in the
mouth, and by the tongue dissolving and preparing the substances
which are to form such: and for the further development of the same
particles and substances, it passes to the stomach, and there is acted
on by the gastric principle, is coagulated,-and the ultimate of this
operation forms blood;-which is drawn by the forces heretofore explained, into the absorbing vessels, and terminates in the venous and
arterial circulation.  The gross and impure particles, which are not
capable of associating with the refined and progressed part, pass into
the substance known as feces or excremcnt, —while according to the
law of universal life, activity and progression, the blood becomes still
more refined. It forms a serum or lymph, which is the next stage of
its progression; and the ultimate of this is the insensible perspiration.
Or for further illustration: There is a chyle of the mouth and
tongue, an original substance-a cause of producing a second chyle,
that of the stomach and pancreas, and which is a still more refined
development of the same principle. And then a chyle is produced,
of the small and large intestines, as an effect or grand ultimate of the
whole functional movements of the formation of blood.
~ 23. Now to bring what has been last said into a comprehensive
condition, we will recapitulate: First, the head, chest, and abdomen.
Secondly, the pozwer which these have upon the system, as an internal force to produce external manifestaitions.  Thirdly, the mouth,
stomach, and intestines. Fourthly, the saliva, gastric and hepatic,
and pancreatic juices. Fifthly, chyle of the mouth, chyle of the
stomach, coagulation, blood, serum, insensible perspiration.  Each is
a cause to produce its ultimate.  These are all series-corresponding to the series in material existence.  And as the formation and
development of blood takes place through a functional operation of
the system, so Life and Sensation are produced by the developments
of the material system.  The Universe originally contained within
itself all the essential properties and substances which are now known
to be developed: so the food which is taken into the mouth, possesses within itself all the properties and essences of blood, but needs
form and condition of series and degrees, to produce such a devel
opment. And each force, organ, or function which is necessarily
called into action to produce blood, must possess within itself the
power to cause all which is ultimately developed.  Each has a series

consisting of three;-corresponding with the series and degrees in
universal creation. And man, therefore, stands as a representative of
the Universe,-containing within himself the ultimate properties of
all subordinate substances; —and consequently he is involved in all
things, which act for and on him as an ultimate.
It is proper, therefore, to deeply and seriously investigate the
original structure and motive power of man, together with the man),
zomplicated parts which are uniformly made evident external: and
by understanding the forms and forces, and the consequent perfection
which is manifested in the human organism, you will perceive a correspondence to all else, whether superior or subordinate, existing in
universal Nature and her laws.  Know one and you consequently
know the other; and by investigating and exploring all below the
power of mind, constituting your own nature, you arrive analogically
at the relative powers of the original laws of motion, which have
governed from the beginning, and do still manifest an undeviating
tendency to universal and eternal progression.
As motion is perpetually changing and exchanging particles, so
there are continual sequestrations and prominent developments of the
same in forms going on throughout all existence; and forms, forces,
and motions, are refined through successive stages, from the most
minute atom in existence, to the most perfect form and symmetryr
which are displayed in the physical organization of Man. The law
or power of procreation and reproduction (in the sense in which
these words are applicable), is universal and eternal.  There is not
such a thing as absolute creation; but what is termed such, is merely
a development of inherent principle3, which are eternally established
and.sustained. New forms and properties, new developments, and
refined and exalted conditions of matter, are merely the visible ultimates of the grosser, yet essential principles of Matter and Motion.
They are therefore produced, or rather made manifest by the law of
perpetual progression. The highest and most perfect form known to
exist, and manifest to the senses, is one link in the great chain of correspondences, which all particles immediately or remotely unite with;
and it is a representative of each successive link. Admit this proposition, and you are compelled through that admission to repose belief
in one Great Power which is governing and controlling all things,
and has established a Law equal to its own comprehension, —whereby
not one thing is existing but what is uniformly developed in forms,
series, degrees, and associations, according to the force and power

which is indivisibly and eternally coexistent therewith! Contempla.
tion is necessary; deliberate reverence and a submissive disposition
are positively required, in order to comprehend and enjoy the privilege of associating with the conceptions and argument herein set
forth!
For a further and familiar illustration of the motive forces of interbal existence, we will speak of the different motions which are developed in Nature, which act on geometrical and mechanical principles.
These are particulars and minutiae, and vary exceedingly, according
to the forms and circumstances of their outward manifestation; yet
they are all comprehended and contained in the First and only Great
Law of Motion, known as positive and negative Forces.
There is existing a motion termed rectilinear.  This contains undeveloped, and progresses to, the spiral motion, which is an ultimatce
of the same principle.  The first motion could not exist until there
were forns capable of manifesting it: and when such motion became
established, the curvilinecar motion was next developed. And other
motions legitimately followed, such as the vibratory, undulatory, eccentric, and spiral or ultimate motions. The many modifications in
which these motions or powers are developed in momentum processes,
were only displayed when there were developments in Nature, of particles, forms, and substances, capable of manifesting these essential
principles. First, the Great Law of Motion existed; and lastly, as
an ultimate development, spiral motion was unfolded; and between
these, intermediate motions were developed and became visible: and
then, and only then, could these motions be admitted or believed to
be existing.
Did not the first motion contain the specific properties and forces
of all the others? or were they individually and independently produced, or created? Is it not probable that they were produced by,
and according to, the law of universal energy and development, and
that they bear a likeness to all other progressions, in forms, degrees,
and consequent forces, such as Matter, Mineral, Vegetable, Animal,
Man, and their respective properties and essences, of Motion, Life,
and Sensation, display? Does not the whole form a succession of
united and corresponding links in the great chain of material development?
The first Power of Motion contained all forces that are now known
to exist. So also did Matter contain the specific essences and properties to produce Man.  Therefore the original forces and laws of

gross Matter and Motion, comprehended a1ll that may now be termned
purified and rarified effects and ultimates; and the whole corresponded, in a general sense, to the law of positive and negative, or
grosser and ultimate, cause and effect, internal and external: and all:ntermediates, and superabounding effects or manifestations, legitimately and indivisibly belong to, and are a part of, the Great Causc,
Effect, and End.
Facts have thus been accumulated, and these stand instead of assertions. They are demonstratively evident as sustaining the proposition first established, as to the existence of a universal and eternal
inherent Law of Motion in Matter, and its powerful and energetic
productions which visibly exist as its effects and grand ultimates.
And these all have been demonstrated in known and visible realities,
in order that the correspondences and laws of association may be
known and properly understood, so that the great question at issue
may be decided.
~ 24. Thus it may be considered established, that Matter contains
within itself an eternal Law of progressive activity. —And what has
been said of Motion, and the various ways in which it is developed,
proves also a corresponding law of life and action as existing indivisibly and coessentially with Matter; the whole containing forces
and materials to produce in future developments, all forms and submstances in existence.  It is thus also shown, that the Whole is composed of parts, and that the parts are necessary to compose the Whole;
and that the Whole is a vast Machine, operating unceasingly by an
inherent principle of perpetual action.  It throws out Effects, which
are the results caused by this action.  The whole is a mcchanical
operation, developing each principle and force, each object and form
which is known to the senses to exist. The whole is governed by
the principle known as the Law of Nature. Scientific investigations
lead to these conclusions, yet can not rest at this point, but look back
still further in search of the First Cause.  The inductive mind will
distinctly observe the indications which all Nature presents, as pointing to the Great First Cazusc, or Positive 11lind.  And upon such,
as a basis, the mind will rest satisfied, feeling that search to find out
a cause still ulterior is absurd, and even beyond its powers of conception.
But resting on the foundation of such a conclusion irresistibly estat)lished, the mind can not but look at the whole of Nature as pro

THEI PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  71
ducing grand effects in an infinite process of progression; and observe
adaptation of means to ends, as displaying external proof of design.
It can not fail to perceive that each part is necessary to the composi-:ion and structure of the Whole; and that the Whole, of necessity,
must be composed of parts; and that each part performs its specific
office in producing and developing new effects and ultimates.
This all proves that Matter and Motion are coeternal principles
existing in Nature; that it is impossible for the general and established laws of these principles to be changed or subverted; and that
these laws are eternally progrcssice, and consequently are eternally
producing successive states of perfection,- and that they consequently
form degrees, series, and associations, as successive stages of development, from the germ of existence to the highest point of material
perfection.
And anything appearing or manifesting operations contrary to the
laws of Nature, must, in such manifestations, be positively incorrect.
Such things do not manifest the inward reality.  And all scientific
investigations prove that external manifestations are not to be depended
upon as a true means of understanding the real producing cause; but
that the Reality-the Cause of all things-lies deeply behind all
external appearances.
And so with Nature. The Internal, the Infinite Reality, the Great
Positive Mind, is producing, as a Negative, infinite Effects and Ultimates, commencing from the inward, expanding and developing to
the outward. The Internal is infinite; and so likewise is the External.  The Whole may be comprehended by understanding the principles and laws of cause and effect; for the Cause is the begining;
the Effect is the Ultimnate. The Whole, considered as universal and
eternal, composes an intelligent, thinking, Positive Mind. Such is a
generalization of all things, setting forth the corresponding movements
and forces that govern this material existence, and proving demonstratively that Motion and Matter exist essentially together, and
possess the properties and essence of all things, organic and inorganic, and also the forces of Life and Sensation by which such are
governed.
And by the establishment of this principle, you have a safe and
sure basis upon which your hopes and anticipations respecting the
future may be rested, not depending upon any theories of a future
existence heretofore prevailing.  It evidently )'-oves a future life beyord a doubt, and makes it as sure and as eternal as the laws that

7'2              THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
govern the Universe.  The existence must be identical and progressive; for such it is known at present to be. And the whole is carried on by principles unchanging and eternal in their nature, and
which can not be in any way confused or disorganized; and thus all
things, from the first, progress with an energetic step to their ultimate
perfection.
It is not the object at this time to prove how (or in what state) the
existence will be, but it is the object to prove that it shall be.  And
by admitting the basis upon which the argument is founded (Motion,
Life, and Sensation), all else is plainly manifested: so that even a
disposition to disbelieve future identity does not in the least affect the
argument from past and present progression, and individualization.
Also a generalization of these truths makes the existence plain as belonging to a universal movement.  But if the detrils and larticul2ars
were noticed, many visible facts would seemingly rather controvert
the proposition: for in particularizing, the connexion with generals
and universals is apparently broken.  Therefore, as the only true
method, you are compelled to generalizce, in order to have one correct
glimpse of a future and boundless eternity.
It being established as indisputable (yet as an idea too vast for ordinary comprehension) that Matter possesses Motion inherently, and
that the whole contains the substance and properties to produce all
things, you, by admitting this, adopt the belief in the lpossibility of
future progression; and by admitting such a possibility, you are compelled (in consistency) to remain quiet until I trace generally and
particularly, from  the Great Positive Mind, the Cause, Effect, and
Ultimate, of all things: and this will exhibit the infinite progression of
all particles in existence, and show that this progression develops the
principle so long involved in obscurity, viz., SPIRIT.
5 25. The two great points, then, which it is the object to establish,
are, the original Cause of all things, and the ultimate of man, which
is Spirit.  The premiss is, the coexistence and universal action of
Matter and Motion. —This establishes the existence of an original
Cause, which latter it is the object to contemplate, so that from this,
tracing secondary causes and effects through Nature, may be proved
the existence and identical perpetuity of the principle of Spirit. - Nature is the fulcrum upon which the first is established of necessity;
and the second as a consequence not only proved by the iaw of progression and association, but by the science of correspondences, in the

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                      73
light of which all the combined sciences should be understood: for
it is by correspondential investigation that we are led to universally
connected and kindred truths. Therefore, if Nature displays universal motion, such as is manifested in all substances and forms which
are known to exist, does not this prove progression?  And progression develops the various spheres, which each substance and particle passes through. If universal association exists (as is proved to
be the case), does there not exist a corresponding future invisible principle? This must of necessity exist, as the result of motion and progression. And the whole combined forms one chain of proofs which is
eternal, establishing the truths which are seen and which are not seen.
Nature therefore represents things which exist in an original condition, and that which is to be in an ultimate Sphere; and all are established by her eternal laws. The beginning and ending form one
infinite circle of movement, development, and progression. Representations of this great principle are seen in the movements of Nature,
the whole of which is formed of concentric circles, from the smallest
particles in existence to the united and perfect form of all things.
It is the office of palatiological* sciences to set forth general truths
in the departments of astronomy, geology, anatomy, physiology, &c.,
all as in perfect harmony with each other, and as forming a general
and undeniable proof of the united chain of existences, and binding
the whole together as one grand BOOK, treating upon all proper subjects of investigation, contemplation, and aspiration-the only authentic and eternal Book of truths, which is inspired by the Original
Designer, the First Cause! From this Book properly interpreted,
should be derived the text of every sermon. In this, true theology
has its foundation; and the teachings of this should constitute the
only study of the theologian.
By collecting palaetiological facts, then, these things are gradually
developed; and thus is unfolded the actual demonstration of original
design, uniformity of motion and progression, and the consequent
adaptation of means (which are effects of ulterior causes), to produce
ultimates.-And thus is displayed the principle of Cause, Effect,
and End, commencing at the foundation of, and operating through,
Nature. And in the process of natural development, each particle,
substance, and form, enters into the composition of vegetable, animal,

and all else existing, by which process the substance or essential principle becomes inldividualized, but not until Mlan is made tile instrument. And by such individualization, it becomes the future and
corresponding principle, Spirit- representing, in a second condition,
the instrument of its individualization.  And as Matter contains the
essence and properties to produce Mlan as a progressive ultimate, so
Motion contains the properties to produce Life and Sensation. These
together and perfectly organized, develop the principle of Spirit
This is not a production consequent of organization, but it is the re
sult of a combination of all the elements and properties of which the
organization is composed; and the organization serves merely as an
instrument to develop the principle of Spirit.  But such principle
must have existed eternally —as emanating from the Great Source
and Fountain of Intelligence; but it could not be individualized and
made manifest without a vessel like unto man.
The subject of which we are now speaking comprehends too much
to be readily and distinctly apprehended, and from its obscurity you
may be unfavorably impressed;but not if you are reminded of the
proposition heretofore established, That no substance or principle
contains within itself the power of self-comprehension and investigation. But to analyze the principle of spirit, would require self-comprehension on your part.  Such a thing can not exist while all investigration and research is depending on the material organization.
Therefore, when in a sphere exalted beyond this one, you will be
able to comprehend the compound existence in this sphere.  While
occupying the second sphere, you will comprehend all below, but can
not in the same sense comprehend anything above you. The human
embryo, if it possessed intelligence, would require as much argument
to prove its future existence as it requires to prove the future exist
ence and identity of the Spirit.  The embryo would not progress to
a perfect being, if it were not for the instruments and vessels fitted for
its development.  So likewise Spirit could not be, if it had not a corresponding instrument adapted to its development.  But when the
foetus is perfectly formed, there is a symmetry and beauty of design
manifested in all the various parts of its formation.  Each organ
must exist in order to produce a perfect form; and the whole must
act on each part, and each part must necessarily exchange particles
with the whole. And so each part has its specific office to perform,
in order that the whole may form one united series of concentric cir

THIE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  75
cles of cause and effect.  Such is itsfirst sphere of existence, corresponding to the first of spiritual existence.
The body progresses in size and symmetry until it attains the ultimate of its progression, according to the inherent properties which
the germ contained; and from childhood to youth, from youth to manhood, and from manhood to old age, are therefore spheres which the
organization passes through. Accompanying these various spheres
of the organization, are corresponding spheres of knowledge and experience. Hence there is an accumulation of intellectual essences
and properties legitimately belonging to the individual.  This corresponds to spiritual progression. Only as the same is developed in
the visible and material form, is developed invisibly and in future, the
principle of spiritual life.  The whole forms one chain of progressive
correspondences: for as the human embryo contains an essential
principle and quality to produce the perfect organization of man, so
does the germ in all existence possess the essence and quality to produce its corresponding result and ultimate, which is Spirit.  This
forms one infinite and eternal Circle. Finite circles are correspondences to those which are eternal; and there is a commencement and
an enid to every particle, visible and invisible; and each one possesses
tile same essential power and motion which the whole contains.
~ 26. Therefore the Whole is composed of parts, and the parts
compose the Whole; and all these combinations in Nature are producing designedly that principle which is so vague and indefinite to
the mind-which is the subject of much contemplation, but not a substance which can be proved to exist by external investigation; though
it is known to exist as an eternal ultimate, of which proof-mathematical demonstration — exists in Nature. And it is only necessary
to comprehend general and universal laws, as these point to that spiritual and intellectual principle, which can not be known to exist by
any other process of investigation, external or internal.  But it is demonstrated by these known laws, which are constantly producing and
developing corresponding principles, ascending in their degrees of
perfection.  For these laws exhibit an infinite chain of progression:
and as the whole forms one great circle, it comprehends and combines
all other circles or corresponding motions and developments that exist in subordinate spheres. And so the original Cause uses Nature
as an instrument —a means —a vessel fitted in all its various parts
and complicationrs, to produce its ultimate, which is Spirit.

76               THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
It is the object, then, that spirit should be individualized.  The
object of such individualization is to establish a communion and sympathy between the Creator and the thing created.  For the Spirit
progresses to the Source whence it came, and then only becomes
fitted for new spheres of its eternal existence.
The proofs of such design are found in physiological indications —
also in the astronomical and geological appearances, and the evident
truths which each of these separately unfolds. And the whole combined forms proof of original adaptation of parts to produce results
corresponding. But such design can only be known or comprehended by induction. And finding that each of these successive departments of Nature forms one circle, which is eternal, the conclusion
irresistibly follows that their combined result (individual man) is
equally so. Thus the Basis, or original Cause, is using Nature as
an instrument, which may be termed an Effect, to produce Spiit as
an End or Ultimate. - The Foundation, the Effect, and the Ultimate,
are all eternal.
For natural and external evidences to demonstrate the great points
at issue, more particular recourse must be had to the received palhtiological sciences, as these exhibit a general connexion between all
sciences, and between cause, means, and ends.
External and visible facts in Nature relative to the whole circle
of forms, and the laws which they observe, are necessary and natural productions of the original Principles established. And an
exhibition of the circles, or of the united and progressive motions of
all things, will serve as an index to direct the mind to the original
Cause, and to conclusions concerning the grand result and ultimatum.
For there are seen undeniable facts, which prove the circular motion
and perpetual progression of each particle and substance.  Also each
science furnishes facts proving the inseparable connexion which all
particles, forms, and substances, observe.

as perceptible, all the essential qualities of its future being.  For
soon after being deposited in the earth, there is, according to laws
which Nature has established, a commencement of its germination.
Not long, and it makes its appearance, assuming a body, a form, a
peculiar sphere. It becomes visible: it progresses to its physiological stature, and is fully developed in size and symmetry. Leaves
gradually are unfolded. And thus from tile germ to the ultimate

exist and are developed the powers originally embodied.  Hence
the germ was the Cause; the form, the effect; the seed, the ultimate
individualized.  This not only establishes the law of progression!
but it proves that there is a circle in the progression; for the plant
ends precisely where it commenced.  It only makes Pefcct what the
original essence contained imnpefcct.  This is a representation of all
germination throughout Nature.  It proves, by analogy, parallel
developments in all other things. And as each vegetable reproduces
its like, it continually re-forms, and produces new identities. One
law governs all; yet each is minutely manifested, and generally developed in its own peculiar way.
The material Universe is a Vortex, from which all forms, material
and immaterial, are unfolded and developed to the external or surface. The forms assume the force and form of the Vortex; while
the Vortex possesses the form and force of the Whole; and from it
new particles and developments are constantly and successively emanating.  And each is in immediate juxtaposition with every corresponding part or particle. Consequently, Nature also forms an
arch, —and as such, to sustain itself requires parts to form the
Whole. And if any part should become disunited, the whole would
become prostrate and disorganized.  But instead of this, each part
performs its specific office, as an end, in the great Arch composed
of them all. It even requires an ultimate to join the great chain or
circle of united mnotion, as the keystone is required to unite and i)erfect the whole arch of existence.
Therefore each part must of necessity constitute an essential substance, and accomplish a particular object; and thus the arch is rendered perfect.  But if any part did not perfectly unite with the other
parts, and with the general formation, the whole would be internally
and externally confused and disorganized. It consequently forms,
as a whole, a perfect Structure; and in ])rt'iculars it is constituted
of the various particles and substances, as means, effects, and instruments, to develop and unite the whole, so that a perfect system
may be formed, to accomplish the ultimate design of the original
Contemplator!

composed of organs, each of which gives to and takes from, every
part that composes the system.  There is a constant inspiration and
exhalation-a constant interchanging of particles going on throughout the whole organization; and thus the whole constantly produces
and reproduces new particles, fitted to its progressive formation.
Again, the whole is composed of minute and particular parts; and
the whole depends upon these for the harmonious results which are
constantly occurring. It not only constitutes a system analogous-to
Nature, but it contains the specific forces and laws of procreation.
Therefore, Man is a representative of the whole material Universe;
and the laws which he constantly develops, correspond with the
motions of matter and its reproducing effects, according to the law
of Nature.  Man first germinates, until finally the original Cause
develops in his maturer condition, the principle of spiritual lift;
while he, again, as a material substance, reproduces his like. C(onsequently, he forms one grand circle of united action.  Naturalists,
anatomists, and physiologists, are aware that these general principles
are established as irresistible truths; and as such they are made to
subserve the purpose for which they are here used.
Again: The geologist forms his speculations concerning the inner
structure of the earth, from the general appearance of the external
surface. Observing the upper strata, he is led to the conclusion that
there are corresponding ones.  And by research and investigation
relative to the primitive formation, he penetrates deeply into causes,
and the primitive condition of all matter; and then reversing the
order of his thoughts, he traces primitive formation to the surface,
which is the ultimate development and progression of the inner principle which the former contains.  Therefore, by observing the various strata and layers of earthy formation, and with them  the
remains of the mollusca, radiata, articulata, and vertebrata (forms
and animals existing, which were successively and gradually developed, accompanying the formations of rock in which they are respectively found), he perceives that each forms a successive link, developing from the centre to the outside, various appearances and forms
which the earth has produced. And at each geological epoch, there
are also seen corresponding productions of the vegetable and animal

kingdoms.  Geological investigations thus correspond with physiological investigations.
Then again, the atmosphere which surrounds this globe has corresponding strata of formations, each one holding a position in relation to the earth according to its specific rarity. The earth possesses
an attractive power over the same, the influence of which counteracts
the expansive force, and prevents the formation of an atmospheric
connexion with the other earths in existence.  Consequently the atmlosphere terminates but a few miles from the earth's surface. Hence
it forms strata or layers; and each exerts a pressure on that which is
beneath it: and the whole produces a weight which is confining to
every particle or substance existing upon the surface of the earth.
Hence the geology of the atmosphere corresponds with the geology
of the earth; for each contains strata equal to its primitive force of
successive development. The whole consequently forms concentric
circles of atmospheric and material formation.
The progression from the lower stages of the radiated to the vertebrated animals, forms also a corresponding circle of development.
And from the lowest stages of the vertebrated (or those which possess
skull and lateral appendages), to the perfect organization of Man,
forms another circle of physical progression. The Motion of original
matter toward the Life existing in the lower spheres of vegetable and
animal existence, and to Sensation in Man, produce another circle or
chain of development from internal to external.  Motion, Life, and
Sensation, combined and perfected in Man, and the purification of
matter as united with these, forms a compound fitted to produce spirit
individualized.  This is the beautification of all beneath and inferior
to its sphere of existence; and consequently it completes one united
chain or circle of progression, from the germ of the vegetable existence, to its own development.  Therefore it is an expansion —an
opening of the invisible principles and properties in existence, to an
ultimate. or perfect state.
Then Nature also must, of necessity, contain and form that which
is analogous to what minimum particles contain and form. And if
Nature manifests one principle of Motion, Life, and Sensation; one
law of progressive and reproductive development, - it must, of necessity, according to an eternal law, operate as an effect or secondary
cause, to produce higher and more perfect spheres of material existence.
It was the object, then, for the earth to gradually progress in its

material perfection to produce plants, animals, and Man.  It is also
the object for Motion, Life, and Sensation, to combine with the perfection of the former, to develop the principle of inner lifc.  Each
form and substance in existence, therefore, is constantly operating as
cause, effect, and end; and the object of each is to produce higher
and corresponding results. So the First or Great Positive Mind
operates as a Cause, through Nature as an Effect, to produce Spirit
as an Ultimate.
Every paletiological science, therefore, adds proof of the great
subject under contemplation.  If Nature in a particular sense manifests unchangeable productions, having so many and various forms,
complications, and correspondences, does not this amount to an absolute demonstration of her inherent and eternal operations in a general
process of development?  And as the germ of the herb produces
body as an effect, and seed as an ultimate; so the Great Essence and
Spiritual Fountain of all existence, produces Nature as an Effect, and
Spirit as an Ultimate. Is there not internal and external evidence
of this, which transcends the mere force of words to express thought?
Are there not inward convictions dwelling in the mind, corresponding
to its desires for a future and eternal state?  Does not the inzternli
constitute the substance of the external? Does not Nature, as an
external Effect, point deeply and directly to the Internal, or Fountain
of its original production?  Is it not a chart whose various lines lead
directly, and with almost mathematical certainty, to a future and
higher state? Do not the inseparable truths which each science unfolds, constitute paths which terminate at one common Focus?
And man contains all this evidence combined within his own physical constitution.  Yet it would be impossible for him, in his present
sphere of existence, to have the subject of a future life demonstrated
to his senses.  Therefore, he contemplates Nature and her laws, as
invisibly and eternally producing results according to their inherent
qualities and forces. And yet the highest and most important subject, and the one most desirable to comprehend, is the principle, the
substance, the inward reality which constitutes the ultimate existence
of the contemplator!,~ 28. The facts and phenomena of all the physical sciences; the
geological history of the earth up to the physiological formation of
man; and the motion, activity, and progression displayed, in all things,
afford abundant proof of the propositions established.  The particu

lars and minutia of these various sciences, and the discrepancies in
the opinions and hypotheses of philosophers to which they have given
rise, do not in any case destroy the force of general principles.
Conclusions arrived at from the apparent indications of minutiae and
isolated phenomena in Nature, can not alter the force of —can not
be irreconcilable with-universal and established laws.
Even if research into the particulars of geology has given rise to
various opinions; if each species of rock or earthy formation contains
various species of animals, whereupon doubts have arisen relative to
the original uniformity of organic development, from the lowest to
the highest spheres; and if marks of organized beings are found only
in some parts of the face of Nature-does this alter the great fact
that they all may in general terms be demonstrated to have existed
in different periods of time, corresponding to our previous propositions?  Such is the uniformitarian theory, as it may be termed; and
internal and external evidence demonstrates its truthfulness.
In various parts of the earth, strata must have been deposited which
are wanting in other parts; for does not Nature, in a particular sense,
manifest evidence of catastrophic events and occurrences?  Does it
not likewise, in a general sense, manifest steady and universal forma —
tion of the various systems of strata?  If, therefore, formations are,
to be found deeper at some places than at others, does not this provco
the action of some particular and modi/iing circumstance or occur —
rence?
These facts, particLtlarly considered, seem to refute several opinions of geologists; but gencralization establishes the principle of uniform and progressive geological development.  Hence the science

must be regarded as having been produced by local causes.
As particular conditions of the earth vary firom the general appearance, so do zoological formations present corresponding variances.
But zoology generalized, establishes the principle of' nnijrmity inr

zoological. Each adds evidence to! the great doctrines of' universalf

assists the mind greatly in properly comprehending their relations to
former forms in existence, and to conceive of the spheres which it is
their nature ultimately to occupy.  In observing the vegetable kingdom, you will notice 1)articular parts which seemingly refute the genera] idea of progression. All plants have not the same mode of progression and reproduction: and even if the smallest vegetable form
should bear a correspondence in a jart cular way to the stupendous
and massive oak, you would lose the representation in a general and
universal point of view.  Hence in investigating the anatomy and
physiology of the vegetable kingdom, the basis upon which the mind
must rest to arrive correctly at truth, is that of known and universal
principles-but not particular and seeming contradictions which the
intricacies of this kingdom may sometimes present to the mind of the
contemplator.  Therefore, if, as a whole, this kingdom presents regular and corresponding appearances, the connexion must not be broken
by isolated and seemingly-conflicting facts.  But if your contemplations are sufficiently deep, searching, and universal, when your conclusions are legitimately induced from the mass of physical facts,
former deductions from scientifics will only serve to confirm them.
But if the manifestations are correctly and philosophically traced,
they will produce an harmonious and united mass of evidences, leading to truths as pertaining to the future, and of which the whole is an
external representation.
No morphological* theory can arise out of a general and united
survey of the whole arcana of Nature.  Morphological theories have
arisen from apparent discrepancies existing between detailed facts,
and from observing these without reference to the whole.  The smallest plant, and the largest tree, present to the generalizing mind one
reflection and one impression; while to the mind which is not capable of receiving universals, or perceiving the relations of cause and
effect, small and ltaige  present the appearance of disunity, not even
manifesting a correspondence.  Consequently theformer mind would
comprehend Nature in her united action; the latter would hold to
morphological opinions, and consequently would observe in Nature
apparently illegitimate productions.  Therefore he would see no
steadfast law, but only repose and impulse, rest and activity, and
eatastrophic and irregular productions.  Hence the power of individualization and generalization in the former can perceive no har*The word "morphological" (whether entirely a nenw coinage or not, I am not:able to say) relates here to a heterogeneous and irregular succession of forms.

mnony and unity of action, but merely a chaos of universal confusion
and development.
Is it strange, therefore, that theories based upon the idea of chancc
should have arisen?  Is it marvellous that men whose intellects were
not in a condition or sphere of general and united comprehension,
should not receive impressions of general and eternal truths?  Is it
a condemnation to such minds that they have formed such theories
in reference to Nature and her origin?  For the cause of such a theory being formed is evidently seen: it is the want of a perfect organization, and owing to the inferior state or sphere in which its framer
exists.  Is it not to be expected that a person whose organization is
perfect in all its parts; whose intellect is expansive and searching;
whose aspirations are exalted and refined —will produce theories
nearer truth than those in an inferior state of spherical association?
~ 29. Again: The anatomy of Man, as connected with that of the
whole animal kingdom, adds strength to the chain of our circled inductions.  The anatomist, like the geologist, observes various forms
and adaptations.  The form of each joint shows original design, and
the internal and external formation of the bones demonstrates the intention of producing strength, lightness, and beauty, combined.  He
sees, in the hollowness and cylindrical form of several of the bones,
a design to combine the greatest amount of power with the smallest
amount of material.
As he passes to the sacral bones, he there observes a basis and
support for the lateral appendages, and observes that its form could
not be dispensed with, and the same amount of strength and action
be combined within so small a compass.  And proceeding from the
os coccyx up the spine, he observes twenty-four different parts united
in one column, combining strength with beauty.  Reflection discovers the lltU)ose of such a formation.  Between each part or bone are
spaces or intervertebral substances, the object of which is to give
elasticity to the whole column, and to adapt it to sustain with ease
and comfort the cranium, with other connected parts.  Again, if the
spine were straight and immoveable, the body could not perform the
necessary movements.  Nor could it sustain the same amount of
weight; for the slightest incidental inclination would disunite the
column.
The adaptation is otherwise manifestly perfect: for the whole
umn possesses twenty-four distinct s2rin'.s.  Consequently

parts unite in performing one motion, and are necessary to the great
whole, characterizing it with strength, elasticity, beauty, and usefulness.
Finally, the anatomy of the human body, and also that of the inferior species of the animal kingdom, teach this grand and important
truth -original and eternal design!  These things are inimitable by
artificial skill!  No means have yet been conceived of by the human
mind, to combine within so small a space the same amount of power,
and the same variety of motion, which the anatomical structure of
man and of the inferior species clearly manifest. Hence the great satisfaction which the true and comprehensive anatomist derives from
his studies.  In this science he contemplates all things previously
existing-still further, the original Ca-use and perfect Designer of all
material and physical existences!  An internal conviction is produced in his mind that there is an inherent and necessarily intelligent Principle existing; because, from the lowest point of unprogressed Nature to the anatomical structure of the animal kingdom
and man, he perceives a united chain of harmonious development,
displaying the principles of order and progression, and exhibiting an
adaptation of all parts to produce a perfect system. And his field of
reflection is too broad, too comprehensive, not to lead him to the
conclusion that there will be a correslpondinog and ultimate ]Pefection
of the same principles which he, in the sphere of anatomy, contemplates as an original production of the Great Positive Mind!
The true anatomist, therefore, will not detail and particularize the
parts of the whole, if the desire is to arrive at general ]pritciz)les;
but he will investigate the parts as composing the whole, and the
whole as composed of the various parts,- and will observe the true
and leading principles exemplified, as corresponding with those gov.
erning the great framework of Nature.
The physiologist,* if he correctly investigates the laws of the human system, and of the animal kingdom, will observe the same interchanging and transmutation of all living particles throughout the whole
animal economy-a constant and universal absorption and exhalation,
a universal order and harmony as pervading the organs of the body.
* The speaker here remarked parenthetically as follows: I;  am compelled to use
circumlocution in examining the various sciences; to induce various conclusions to
form one conclusion, and to plainly bring the subject to one mind by one process of
reasoning, and the same to other minds by a different process,- so that the truths
may be confirmed to the different mental orga.nizations which may peruse the contents
of this work."

truths may be harmonized. The consideration that all Motion, Life,
and Sensation, subsist as dependent upon every part, leads to universal principles,-thus to the idea of existing harmony.  The tr7ue
physiologist observes that the lowest form of life passes from its
sphere, in other forms, through each stage of animal existence, until
it becomes fitted for the nourishment of the human form.  He observes and contemplates this as a progressive fluctuation of animal
life toward higher spheres of perfection. Also, this forms one united
circle of assimilation of lower with higher substances, and consequently adds to the whole united mass of living species and beings
universally existing, depending upon the interchange of these particles to sustain their original forms, and also to constantly reproduce
new systems at different periods of time, as determined by the perfection, influx, and reflux of animal matter.
Hence the Whole, in a broad and comprehensive sense, is necessary to the mutual and perpetual action of all particles, which leads
to the perfection of matter and fits it to sustain the physiological
structure, symmetry, and beauty of the whole animal kingdom. This
represents Nature in all spheres of anterior production and procreation. It bears a correspondence to the teachings of every other science,-and distinctly points to the original Focus and Fountain of
Spiritual Intelligence which is thus universally manifested.
Each palaetiological science, therefore, in its general application,
confirms the internal and external harmony and unity of Nature's mo*tions, as leading to perfection in all its parts; and from the smallest
and internal circle, and the remotest period of primitive existence, is
constantly observed a perpetual progression and development. From
minimum points Nature expands in comprehension of beings and
substances, until there is an infinite expansion of all particles, and of
united circles of life and activity. For as the whole is a Vortex of
reproducing causes, the ultimate must bear a correspondence to the
eternal Fountain or internal Vortex of external development!

there is none who holds a more conspicuous place, and whose experience is more useful, than the true mechlanic.  To him are due the
many inventions which have from time to time been produced, anal

and magnetic forces have been constantly producing and rep)roducing
the smallest particles which are distinctly seen undergoing changes
constantly. They not only produce life and motion in all forms, but
the powerful action of the muscular fibre of the animal creation, is
produced thereby. By this means certain animals are enabled to lift
an immense weight, and to draw many tons; while without it they
could not exhibit any muscular manifestations. The motion existing
among all forms, spheres, and planets, can be legitimately -traced to
the omnipotent power which is contained within these principles.
And water, also, has been observed to pass intd an unparticled and
rarified form. In the dew-drop, and in the broadest ocean, constant
evaporation and refinement of this element is taking place. But not
until lately was discovered the energetic power that existed in the
expansion of watery vapor. But now such power is employed for
practical purposes, though it is not yet fully developed. The progress of knowledge in these principles has been corresponding to
their outward, physical manifestations. The power of steam was at
one time unknown and disbelieved; and those minds, who by unwearied research became internally convinced of the existence of such
a power, and openly expressed their convictions, did not escape the
charge of fanaticism.  Visible and ocular demonstrations have at
length convinced the skeptic and the world, that there is an inherent
power contained in water unparticled; but how much, and to what
extent it may be applied, is not yet known.
Did it not originally require the same amount of argument to convince the understanding that such a principle and power existed, as
it requires to convince the mind of a similar principle as existing in
other rarified and unparticled matter?  The first allows evident proof;
the latter does not admit of the same. For the latter is the highest
and most perfect condition of all things existing; while the former is
a mere subordinate and mechanical development,-notwithstan(ling
it corresponds with the inherent principle that constitutes the reality
of all things.
Inventions, then, are mere imitations of Nature, and applications
of principles therein contained. Nature, in a mechanical respect, is
acting in a perfect way; while man's inventions are but an imperfect
representation of the same.  Consequently, there is no inventionno creation of 1priilciplcs-no forming originally what has not primitively existed.

through the instrumentality of which other planets and spheres will
become still more visible, and their physical condition more distinctly
apparent, is, with all its perfection of formation, and the millions of
particles which compose it, only an imitation of the principles
involved in the hluman eye!  Yet the latter in its construction, and
in the principles on which it acts, is of itself an emblem of original
and eternal Design. The whole forms an instrument combining
beauty and usefulness.  It is not yet properly imitated by this great
and wonderful telescope, which is now about to be developed on
corresponding principles.
The true mechanic receives his lessons from Nature, in each of
which he discovers his inability more than partially to imitate the
principles therein manifested: and when forces are combined and
developed in the various machines which he constructs, he only finds
them to be an imitation of some great principle which Nature originally and eternally contained.  And if his inquiries are first to know
the laws and principles existing in Nature, his action next will be to
apply the same mechanical principles, only in an inferior degree of
magnitude; and thus he avails himself of the usefulness of such
seeminin  inventions.  And when observing Nature as a Whole,
operating in her various parts on mechanical principles, all his reasonings and inventions will be of a corresponding character.  And if
he did not soar too soon from the surrounding and visible manifestations of these potent principles, to the origin of motion in the centre
of the planetary system, he would receive more truth and light upon
these subjects, by properly understanding that which is around him.
But desiring to be free from  external intrusions and interruptions,
which his connexion with the world subjects him to, he vainly
attempts to shut all the senses which connect him with such, and in
this state of abstraction, while the internal principle takes unto itself,
as it were, similar senses, he endeavors to associate with a higher
sphere of material existence. Not satisfied with the general and
minute representations of Nature that are around him, he, with the
internal principle, views higher spheres, for the purpose of investigating the laws which govern their perpetual motion and activity.
Hence, theories and hypotheses innumerable have been produced,
merely because abstract reasoning can not be perfect, while the intellect is still connected with its original tenement, and because men
have not reasoned correspondentially from  principles which are
abundantly existing around, above, and within them

The phenomenon known as gravitation is universally observed.
Why not, then, investigate the cause of gravitation?  And by correctly understanding this, you would establish the true theory of all
other and corresponding manifestations throughout the planetary
system.  Many disquisitions have been given to the world, relative
to thef.ct of gravitation, but none particularly explaining the Cl'ose
of the phenomenon. It is well, therefore, not to pass above or
beyond immediately surrounding manifestations, until you have
become thoroughly convinced of the inherent properties and principles which cause such.
~ 31. Mechanical principles, therefore, constitute the united action
and forces of Nature: and by and through these, the true mechanic
receives his unchangeable instructions. And by following these as
he has done, he gradually develops the principles contained in them
as invisible and universal. Also, each motion, from the curvilinear
to the spiral (the only motions which he knows as existing, but which
have eternally existed in Nature), have been isolatedly manifested ill
the various machines which he has seemingly invented.  And having
the various forces and motions concentrated in a small space, he for
the time being loses the thought that his invention is a mere imitation
of Nature's original laws, and feels a self-elevation in contemplating
the great and inimitable production, of the creation of which he feels
he was the cause.  But by reflection, he observes that Nature and
ner inherent principles, are only developed and made manifest in his:ontrivance.  And by having his contemplations extended througlh-,)ut the various parts of creation, in reference to the Whole as a
reflection of each part, he quiets the ambitious principle within him
by the consolatory feeling that what he has seemningly created, was
established by the eternal design of the First Cause or Positive
Mind! As these principles are all impressed indelibly in Nature, he
feels that a correct knowledge of them leads to corresponding truths:
and the first idea of original design impresses the mind with a Final
Cause. And if they exist in one particle in Nature, or if they are
(as they are acknowledged to be) spread throughout Nature, and are
manifest in all her movements, they must be of necessity eternal
principles; and when developed, they correspond to intellectual
progression; and that progression with the conviction of the mind's
eternal existence; and which conviction, when properly developed
in the mind, leads to all corresponding truths.

A law can not be different in different parts of the Universe; and
when you properly'understand the cause of gravitation in a smalt
substance or particle visible, you may know  that the same cause
produces corresponding effects in every other state of material
existence. *
The principles of Nature (as now  manifest), and the laws and
forces of mechanics, are a progression of the inherent properties and
essences primitively contained in all things. The true mechanic
looks through Nature, and obtains a conviction of its primitive and
original condition: and also from Nature forward and upward,
through the Spheres of future and eternal progression, and spiritual
development.  If he has not a comprrehension, he has still an irresistible conviction, of these things.  He observes cause, effect, and
end, in all things. He can contemplate the state which the natural
progress of all things tends to develop.  Original design is not manifested, without means to produce an end. He arrives at the conclusion that there can not be too much activity nor too much rest;
that there can not be illegitimate or catastrophic productions, as
arising from the general law and motions of Nature. t  He will not
take the details and minutia for general and universal truths.
The contemplation, the reflection, the experience, therefore, which
the rational mechanic derives from Nature, adds one other link to
our chain of paletiological science, and to the great circle of universal truth.
Thus mathematical and mechanical instruments have been produced; and they have afforded means by which new truths could
be developed.  The principles of Nature give lessons to the searcher
*By way of note it was here observed by the speaker, that although perpetual motion is an inherent principle of Nature, yet of necessity man could not imitate it by any
mechanical construction or process. It had been already remarlked, that " no principle
contained within itself the power of self-investigation" - that spirit, for instance, can
not comprehend spirit. Now man is of himself a perpetual motion; it is this that
investigates; and the production of perpetual motion by him, would involve the principle of self-investigation or comprehension.
fIt was here remarked incidentally by the speaker, that catastrophes, or irregular
impulses of Nature, were by some thought to account for the production of man and
other living beings; but that this can not be true, according to principles previously
laid down. The harmony existing between the various parts of the organic kingdoms, and their development according to the precise order of a graduated progression,
preclude the idea of any irregular or paroxysmal efforts of Nature being engaged in
their production. The generals of this subject will be understood by perusing the
author's theory of creation, as it is progressively unfolded in the sequel.

into their essential constituents, which are of immense value.  Yet
there are instruments by which principles have been found to be
existing, which were before unknown. These have been useful in
the investigation of the inherent properties of Matter and Motion,
besides in the developing of mechanical laws. And thus Nature
and her general principles are made to yield to man the internal evidence of external truth.  He can see an absolute display of Nature's
laws in every form and particle of material existence. He can
observe the close connexion and inherent sympathy existing between
all particles that compose the fabric of the universe.  No being is in
a condition or sphere of association with more inherent truth than
the true mechanic. He can see the inherent properties of every
production of his hand, contained in Nature: and when reflecting
that his invention is but a mere uc-simile of Nature, he rejoices in
the inward conviction that the Fountain of Nature is overflowing
with truths which are gradually assuming new forms, according to
their specific character, in order to present themselves in a more
perfect state of progressive existence.  He feels the inward conviction, fiorn the evidence of external truths, that Nature is inexhaustible; and that what is required is for him to continue his precise and
indefatigable researches, not with a previous bias of mind, but with
a freedom to receive any conclusions which a reasonable amount of
evidence may establish.  He sets no limits to the expanse of thought.
He establishes no belief until he is forced by the preponderance of
evidence impressed upon the internal understanding. He observes
all laws as tending to a state of ultimate perfection; and through the
same laws he casts reflection back, and contemplates the original,
intelligent, Organizer of the Universe!
Such mechanical investigations are of too deep and rational a na
ture to permit superficial or external appearances to divert the mind
from internal and ultimate conclusions.  The inductions carry the
mind back from each effect to its original cause; and each cause,
being an effect of a cause still anterior, the intimations of uninterrupted causation which are seen in all the corresponding sciences,
carry the reasoner back to the First, Original, Positive Principle,
which he can not but believe is the very essence of perfect intelligence.  And then he can see a design in all forms presented to the
senses. But can he confine his belief to these points? And is he not
forced to believe that which is to be?  For the First and Last are
constantly demonstrated in Nature. Organizations and forms are

constantly being reproduced: disorganization and decay are secmningly
the counterpart of life, —but in reality are only the process of metamorphosis from the first sphere to some other state of progression
Hence the disorganized being appears in a new form-is organized
in new spheres-but still is a continuation of its previous inherent
properties. It is also fitted for a new work, in which there is a manifest design to form some part corresponding to other parts of the
whole Fabric of Nature. Life and death in any particles, are not
opposite to each other; but the first must exist to produce the last:
the last must occur to reproduce and' continue the progression of the
former.
~ 32. Each form, therefore, is constantly passing through an endless succession of spheres, in order to associate and correspond with
the particles and essences that compose its original nature. And
when the mechanic observes all these appearances, which are constantly developing themselves with accompanying principles of life
and activity, he has the consolation of knowing that these all operate
upon eternal mechanical law.  And as developments in Nature become visible, he observes that all principles which are gradually
evolved from the internal, are manifest in proportion to the perfection
of the substance, form, and instrument, through which each motion
and law is made visible. His experience corresponds with truths
established in other sciences.-And the whole confirms the propositions that have been established: That there is a constant and universal motion existing in matter, as an essential property of its nature;
that it is continually (and must of necessity be) progressice; and that
it also reproduces forms by virtue of the inherent properties of its
nature, and that each assumes a degree and species and consequent
peculiar association: that these are the production of 3Iitter, and
Life and Sensation the production of 3lotion; that the continuation
and perfection of the two principles conjoined, compose Man as an
Ultimate; and that man is composed of particles and essences of all
things else existing.
Consequently all below man must, of necessity, enter into the composition of his being.  The perfection of his material organization
(including all the essences which have originally become refined to
associate with the same parts of matter) produces, as a specific ultimate, the principle of Intelligence. The ultimate of this, corresponding with all other progression, composes S]pirit indirzidualiz-ed. An('

according to the eternal impetus which this first received, it ascends
through.new spheres of existence, corresponding to that which it previously occupied; and also represents the universal perfection and
refinement of all parts as becoming unparticled,-and which then,
like spirit, form a counterpart to material progression.
Hence the whole develops the science of correspondences. It
proves the concentric movements of all Nature; it establishes the fact
that the reality of all external things is existing in an invisible condition, and that forms are but the constant manifestations of their inward
reality. And the mechanic feels these laws to be associated with his
mind as Truth is associated with Nature.  Consequently he can
also appreciate and realize the internal truth which Nature openly
manifests.
This all recalls to mind the sublime and established truth, That
the Cause is using Nature as an Effect, to produce Spirit as an
Ultimate!
The Original Cause of all things must produce Ultimates to correspond with its own nature.  If the First is perfect, the End must be
also.  If the first'Essence is progressive in its nature, its Ultimate
must be the same. If the original Fountain was Supreme Intelligence by nature, it must produce intelligence as a legitimate result.
If the First was divinely pure, the Ultimate must be the same in all
its specific qualities.  If the First was eternal, the Ultimate must be
equally so.  If the Original, Positive Mind-the Germ-the intelligent Organizer of material and universal Nature —contains within
itself all the perfection of beauty and intelligence, infinitely beyond
the comprehension of finite beings, must not the Ultimate, the spirit
of man, of necessity, be in harmony therewith in all its specific
essences and qualities?  Must it not, as a legitimate offspring of the
Great Omnipotent Productor, be correspondingly pure and divine?
If Nature, in any of her chains of visible production, contradicts
any general principle of this conclusion, then the mind is not called
upon to respond to the teachings of her immutable laws as producing
-from the internal, external effects.  If the germ of a plant, of an animal, of any reproducing form or sphere in Nature, produces an ultimate unlike itself, then you may reasonably conclude that the seed
or ultimate is contaminated in the process of passing from inward to
outward spheres. -But it is evident that the seed (or ultimate of the
original germ) has assumed a more pcfJ'ct sphere of existence.  It

has not become more pure or refined in its qualities and essences;
but it has ascended to an ultimate sphere of a nature corresponding
to its first, and exists in the beauty and freshness of its newly-assumed
condition. Hence, though not intrinsically more perfect, it is more
Beautiful and reproductive. Consequently spirit, individualized from
the Germ of an eternal existence, through the instrumentality of-Nature and Man, has become like the Primitive Essence, only progressed
by its internal freshness of beauty and refinement. I-ence it bears the
impress and contains all the essential properties of the Original Source!
It is divine, pure, intelligent: it of necessity must be so, because it
is a legitimate Termination, an Ultimate, an entity composed of the
substance, the particles, the inherent qualities, which were contained
in the Great Spiritual Fountain.  Therefore its nature is inexhaustible, perfect, and refined, —generating intelligence of a progressive,
identical nature, equal to its combined essences as originally contained in the Vortex in which existed the Great, Omnipotent, Positive Mind!
Spirit may be considered as a negative result, but it is no less pure,
no less perfect, on that account.  It is what the First was: it will
be what the First is. And here again the mind is internally impressed with the' truthfulness of that eternal chain of cause and
effect!

too valuable, and of too convincing a nature, to be here disregarded.
And by noticing them, there will be no less good done than appealing to his reflections, and conveying to him an internal confirmation
of the principles heretofore discussed.  As his associations are wsitlh
Nature and ber developments, deep and truthful impressions must of
necessity be made upon his mind thereby.  Even the laws of art are
in accordance with Nature, and coincide with all general principles
which are correct and infallibly true; and these laws point him to the
magnitude and beauty of Nature's general and detailed manifestations.
His associations are worth more than they are supposed to be by the
mass of other researchers in the various departments of science to
which we have alluded. The manifestations of Nature are by him
constantly intended to be impressed upon the understanding, so that
these may answer as symbols and types, shadowing forth to the mind
the internal and invisible causes.  And as all scientific investigations
are based upon the appearances of things, so likewise is the deep

meditation of the true and profound artist based upon such appearances. And the innumerable processes by which he has explored
the many parts and avenues of Nature, bring convictions to his mind
corresponding to the conclusions drawn from  all palamtiological sciences; and as these convictions emanate from the Source of all true
and correct impressions, they should be, and are received.
It is not because his pursuit tends to soften and refine the feelings
of his nature; it is not that it has such an overwhelming and subduing influence upon all his actions and internal desires-that I here
call up his meditations and experience: but it is because it pertains
to the source, the fountain, the manifestation of all things in the material landscape of existence, and because his communion with these
things conveys truths at once subduing and convincing- and which
truths are beyond the conception of any class of mankind who do not
associate with the same things which he is compelled to associate
with. His main desire and effort is to copy or imitate the general
appearance of that which is before him. He feels that in doing this,
he accomplishes a great work, merely because it is based upon that
which is inexhaustible.  He feels that Nature contains all the variegated scenes and manifestations which he would fain grasp and familiarly develop.  He also is impressed with the thought that all his
efforts are to develop that which is internally and externally manifest
to his senses. He feels also, in recalling the experience of the effect
of that which he has previously accomplished, that it is to him like
the machine to the mechanic-an imitation, an outwatrd development
of that which is internally existing.
In analyzing the laws of colors, he arrives legitimately at the conclusion that the five or seven* original colors can be, and are, evolved
from one; that that contains within itself the properties and qualities
friom which all other distinct reflections may be unfolded. EIe also
is aware that these colors may be produced and reproduced according as there are instruments, agents, or substances, through which
they may be manifested.  It is owing to the developments which
Nature is constantly producing and reproducing, that these various
colors are unfolded. Light, as originally and universally existing,
contained the specific essences and attributes which are contained in
the various colors as they are at present distinguished and classified.
And each of these colors was revealed according as suitable outward

instruments were developed. All of this teaches him the undeniable
and important truth, that the Original contained undeveloped that
which exists in present forms, and that all which does thus exist is
owing to the progressive principle which is inherent and eternal.
Then by these deep, solemn, and irresistible convictions, he perceives the connexion which he sustains with all other existences.
He also feels the conclusion pressing with redoubled force, that Nature and her manifestations are leading to a higher and corresponding Sphere, to which it is his constant desire and aspiration to attain.
These correspondences are to him  a mediator —a fulcrum-upon
which his accumulated knowledge and experience performs its various operations: for they are not only established by that which is
demonstrated to the senses, but they afford as deep and convincing
proof of the invisible and real Reality.
Back of Nature, he silently contemplates the CGause which produced this theatre of human existence; and with the highest reverence for truths pertaining thereunto, he can almost associate with the
first Principle of Life and activity! His aspirations are purely of an
intellectual and moral character, intending his highest and best productions as a familiar development of that which Nature so vividly
manifests. And when contemplating that which he has produced,
there is an exalted and elated thought which forces itself upon his mind
(and which is altogether imaginary), that he has created something
which Nature does not contain.  But in observing the many forms
and substances which are constantly developing and reflecting new
truths to his mind, he recognises something infinitely surpassing that
which he vainly supposed to be created by his skill.
Then, again, the draught of Nature suggests to his mind that she
contains inherent truths; for in viewing his production, the impression
is called up that Nature nowhere presents a parallel.  Thus, at second-thought, his picture loses its intrinsic beauty; and the exalted
imagination which created it proves to be as evanescent as the colors
of the eastern sky when tinged by the innumerable reflections of the
horizon.  For as his imagination is excited upon subjects distinct
from his production, a change, corresponding to the change of
thoughts, takes place in the appearance of the latter.  For Nature,
with a renewed reflection, impresses his mind with more intrinsic
truth than is represented in his imitation, which is of so shadowy and
evanescent a character.

~ 35. All the imitations or types of the appearances and substances
existing around him then, are merely a developing of original truths
in a familiar manner, so that he may associate mole closely with that
which it was his constant desire and intention to produce. Being
convinced of this truth, he does not strain his mental and physical
powers to outdo or misrepresent that which is before him, but he is
contented if his production is a fac-simile of that which does constantly develop itself to the senses.  His occupation also tends to impress
his mind with the truth that generals and univcrsals are the only reli
able evidence of truth in contemplating the boundless landscape of
Nature.  He finds that in detailing and particularizing, he spoils
the grand and sublime effect that it is his intention to reproduce.
For the general view presents beauty and perfection; the particular
disconnects and disorganizes the grand features of the whole.  His
experience teaches him that detailing disorganizes and disunites the
truth which it is his object to impress; but that generalizing presents
one unbroken chain of connected beauty, magnificence, and perfection.
And above all other aspirations to which he is led, is that to have
the effect of his production such as will precisely accord with original and eternal Truth. He finds that the lparts- the lights and shades,
the distance and perspective-compose the whole, and that the
whole is necessary to the parts. The whole combined presents the
internal conviction that the Effect must, in quality and principle, be
like that which originally produced it.
Thus his meditations are impressive; and, like all the others referred to, are irresistibly convincing. For each representation of necessity connects the mind with its antitype; and by this means truth
must necessarily be unfolded to the understanding. Likewise, from
the invisible to the visible, and from that to the ultimate, he observes
a circle, or a series of concentric circles, of corresponding and neverending truths. And while his thoughts and feelings are thus exalted
by a contemplation of the beauties which Nature manifests, he also
is internally impressed with the proposition before mentioned, that
the Original, the First Organizer of all the concentric and progressive circles of material existence, must of necessity and absolutely,
from its inherent nature, produce like Ultimates.
As the First is positive, the Ultimate is negative.  As the First is
inward, the End is outward; and as the First is eternal, the Ultimate must be the same. And as the First, or the Omnipotent Positive Mind, contained all the essential attributes of purity, refinement,

and perfection-the grand, sublime, and legitimate Result of this
First Principle can not be of a less pure and perfect nature.
Thus the experience and conviction of every true artist; the impressive lessons which he receives from the various symbols and
types of internal beauty and perfection; the subduing effect and controlling and tranquillizing action which these have upon his disposition; the general appearances of things, and the indestructible union
which he perceives existing between all particles composing the mass
of the material existence; the confidence which he is enabled to repose in Nature, and the internal design manifested on the externalall go to establish the main truths and conclusions which it is necessary to impress.
Consequently, his thoughts and affections are associated with truths
His desires and interests are no less pure and perfect than the lessons which cause them to exist. His reason leads him by connected
steps to the truths and inductive conclusions above established, respecting the First and Ultimate of existence.
When he becomes disconnected from the manifestations of Nature,
and associates with the innumerable thoughts and feelings which areconstantly agitating the external world; when unprincipled and impure interests obtrude upon his feelings and attract his mind from tile
train of thought and contemplation in which he is naturally engaged
while copying Nature and her inimitable beauties; and when his mind
becomes involved in the pursuit of an individual subsistence and
preservation of life —he then forcibly realizes the great extreme of
commotion, immorality, and imperfection, that pervade the external,
world of mankind.  HIe then can see that truths can not be received
from man alone, but from Nature; and that the truths thus received,
are irresistible and eternal.
The extremes also impress him with the conclusion, that' the innlmerable capacities, powers of perception, and spheres of associationi
into which mankind are divided, have no,foundation in Nature or herlaws. He is in a condition to perceive the great disconnexion between Nature's established laws, and man's present ignorance, imperfection, and grossness.  In the former, he is impressed with tlhe
immutable and imperishable harmony and truth which are constantly
and openly manifested; and in, thelatter, lie sees general, superficial,
and erroneous conceptions of the principles of organic life, -and still'
a greater perversion of the affections, the understanding, and the in-.
award principles, which constitute the spiritual nature of man.

98              TIHE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
The beauty, the magnificence, the degrees of perfection manifested
in all external appearances, upon the broad plain of material existence, enforce the conviction of an inner life of corresponding beauty
and perfection.
Between the lowest and highest conceptions; between the meaner
opinions and desires of illiterate persons, and the most brilliant and
refined imaginations of the intellectual man; between the lowest germ
and the highest sphere of vegetable existence, and between the
diminutive and instinctive animal and the highest and most erudite
man of science, -can be observed a medium, a centre, afbcus, which
is an ultimation of the two extremes. Truth may in this way be
manifested and correctly arrived at; for the extremes of two points
must, of necessity, be poised upon an intermediate point: and this
may represent the truth which it is absolutely necessary to impress,
— that there must exist invisible truths corresponding to all that is
seen, known, felt, or desired. For each object of sense must have a
a ucse back of its production.  So also the intellectual and aspiring
disposition of mankind is, in reality, a symbol- a type of truths such
as correspond to the workings of the mind.  Therefore, between the
Great Positive Mind and the human Spirit, there must be a medium,
a type, a symbol, through which may be seen the original Design,
and the future, ultimate Perfection.
To the searcher and observer of external manifestations, the Universe is a symbol, a type of that which was and is, and of that which
must and will be.  Hence, taking Nature as truth, it carries these
convictions,- which have been heretofore impressed. Like all other
mediums, it must be truth, or it could not be a medium. It answers
as a guide to internal meditation, and as a subject of external contemplation.  Therefore, the First and Ultimate of all things are
rational and irresistible inductions that can be drawn from the prolific,
fertile, and truthful experience and meditation of the true artist, and
who associates with Nature's inimitable beauties.

and also upon the subject of the Supreme Organizer of the material
Universe; and as these two subjects are of like nature, though manifestly extremely remote in their connexion (especially as they ap.
pear to the intellect of man), various thoughts have been in order
communicated to the world in reference to the origin of Matter and
Motion, and respecting the formation and organization of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, together with the three powers combined
as vitality: and many well-written theories upon the subject of intellectual and spiritual composition have been produced. Each person
who has presented these subjects according to his individual perceptions and convictions, has set forth some very important truths, and
has fallen into as many errors of like magnitude.
Tile persons who have thus presented their impressions to the
world, have done it under circumstances and conditions exceedingly
unfavorable to the communication of truth without disconnexion.
Nature and their impressions have afforded some deep convictions,
which they could not express with sufficient clearness to be familiarly
understood.  The sphere that they associated with, was likewise unfavorable for acute and correct. perception. Being surrounded by all
the interruptions and intrusions of life and activity in the external
world, and their senses being too familiarly associated with the same,
and the utter impossibility of their rising above the first sphere of intellectual existence, have prevented the full communication of eternal
and imnperishable truth.  It is not strange, therefore, that men thus
situated should communicate their thoughts to the beclouded and
unstable minds of the world, tinctured with various sophistries and
untruths, which, if they might justly be penned as convictions, were
nevertheless misconceptio2s of those internal and ultimate principles
which govern the spheres upon which their theories have been founded.
It is not strange that men, thus reasoning from Nature alone, and the
temporal and celestial appearances that she irregularly develops, should
arrive at erroneous conclusions, -for which they are not condemnable, yet not justifiable.
For let it be again impressed, that Nature must be the result of an
anterior Cause; and that the First Cause, or Organizer, instituted,
or, in other words, from its eternal nature, organized the many spheres
of material existence that are disseminated universally throughout the
broad expanse of unimaginable space. These laws, thus divinely instituted, acting through that mass of nebulous matter which existed
from the beginning, have gradually produced and reproduced new

forms, and finally have developed just such worlds of material formation as are now manifested. Then why take Nature, or rather the
small particles of the Universe, of which this world is one. as being
the p rimary Cause of animal organization, and this as having progressed
to Man, through chance and change of the elementary particles and
compositions of matter, until the necessary particles have philosophically and mutually agreed to perform the specific office which the
human organization manifests? That, too, while each function of the
system is so perfect, so genuine in all its reproductions, that one effort
-one energetic impulse —started, and has ever since continued, the
whole in'motion! For at the very moment the heart contracts and
sends forth the blood throughout the indescribable parts and avenues
of the human form, the lungs, the brain, the whole system becomes
active; and that activity produces intelligence!
And the conception which has been formed of the original production of man, is no less groundless as applied to the intellectual principle of his nature.  Taking Nature as almost containing the laws of
* her own existence, independently of any coexisting Power, vain attempts have been made to account for the production of the principle
of Mind; and in these attempts, there have been thoughts and impressions received into the minds of many, that the First must have
been Matter, and that Man is a production of some energetic and
violent effort of Nature and her constituent particles-that Man thus
exists by an indefinite Chance!
As the First is the Omnipotent, Original, Positive Mind, and the
Third, Spirit individualized and unparticled, constituting a corresp2onding intelligence, and approximating to higher spheres of intellectual perfection, these theories arise from mistaking the Effct (or
Nature) for the Causc.  They consequently darken the perception
of future and corresponding spheres of intellectual existence; and
their adherents take Nature as the Cause, Man as the Effect, and
Mind as a natural result of physical organization.  The first is visible: the last is thought to be also; for, taking external appearances
for realities, and depending upon them as the only source of undisputable truth-as ocular demonstration-man loses sight of all connexion between internal reality and temporal substances, and between
body and spirit.
The connexion thus broken can not be united in a mind thus observing Nature. The result has been to throw upon the world theories misconceived and misconstructed. But by observing (through

the power of analysis) the invisible, the reality of all things, and taking
this as a basis of reasoning, — by virtue of a concentration and analogical application of the mind to the subject under consideration, and
by tracing distinctively, collectively, generically, progressively, and
universally, all things,- the conclusion becomes irresistible, that
Spirit must exist as an absolutely necessary result of the nature, essence, and composition, of the Supreme and Omnipotent Productor!
I have not brought up theories previously presented to the world,
in order to refute, or even to criticise them.  I have not presented
Ihe subject in such a manner as to cast disparaging reflections on
those who have conscientiously penned these theories; but I have
briefly spoken of these in order to establish and make plain three inductive conclusions: First, that a man, subjected to the interference
of the commotions of the outer world, can not, by any possible means,
fully perceive and comprehend general truth.  Secondly, that, instead of legitimate inductions and conclusions, the above theories are
unjustifiable assumptions, and illegitimate conclusions drawn therefrom. Thirdly, that the Original Organizer of the Universe has been
even forgotten or misconceived of, by ill-directed veneration for truth;
that Spirit has consequently been annihilated from the sanctions of
the reasoning powers, and has had no part in the admissible conclusions of such minds,-and that, in consequence of receiving the
above as the basis of reasoning, the First and Ultimate were thus
obscured in the minds of men, and shrouded in inextricable and impenetrable mystery!
~ 36. These three are the conclusions I intended should be
drawn from the general survey of misdirected reasoning.  I do not
wish that the above should be considered as a refutation or discussion of any principles referred to, or that it was for this purpose that
these theories were called up for present meditation.  The intention
has not been to show the errors of human judgment, nor even to
offset these conclusions by opposite reasonings; but it has rather
been to excuse such investigators, and to encourage them to look
deeper and further for real producing causes; to justify their impressions so far as they contain truth, and to point out the great distinction between interior truth, and the error conveyed by visible and
external appearances, though such are still considered as ocular
demonstrations of unchanging truth.  I would show the impossibility

of such theories and hypotheses being true, not in a spirit of exultation or self-approbation, but to direct the minds of their believers
to a deeper and indestructible basis, from which are constantly emanating through the veins and avenues of Nature, never-ending Truth.
Not that the mind should leave its rational resting-place, and cleave
to that which is miraculous, superstitious, or without demonstration:
but the reasoner upon these subjects should be like the chemist, and
not base his conclusions upon the visible apl)caraclcc of the substance,
or form; but analyze the composition to find its elements, and invisible
reality.  Then the arguments based upon these internal principles
will lead synthetically to irresistible conclusions, irrespective of the
form or appearance of the substance external.  And then the truth
will become manifest; and to it, as such, you should respond with
the deepest, internal, true affection and veneration.  Then may be
understood the force and propriety of the expression (which is as true
as the laws of Nature), that " the things which are seen are temporal;
but the things which are not seen are eternal."
Under whatever circumstances, or by whatever individual, Truth
may be conceived of, or whenever it may be found or written, it
should be duly appreciated.  No direct course of reasoning can be
entirely barren of truthful conclusions, notwithstanding these may be
mingled with errors.  All investigations of a scientific and theologic al character, have conduced to some important conclusions; nevertieless in these some deductions have been made which are incorrect.
The mind should observe a train of connected induction to arrive at
truth: a mind no20t thus concentrated, would come far short of correct
impressions.
The subjects of the First and Last, as seen through Nature, have
been much thought upon, and discussed with pure dispositions and
intentions; and in the numerous productions of men upon these
subjects, many valuable truths have been set forth.  The whole truth
could not be conceived of, for the want of a higher sphere of association.  No metaphysical researches, therefore, have yet established
or adequately demonstrated to the comprehension, the principle of
Spirit, or inner liSe.  And if the decisions of minds partially
clouded and obstructed by surrounding circumstances, have occasionally, and to some extent, been correct, a confirmation will be found
in the Revelation.  Those which are not true, and have been the
resuhlt of unjustifiable modes of reasoning, the Revelation will also

place in their proper light.  And whactever truths have entered the
minds of investigators, they will see the same reflected; which will
be a source of inward gratification.  There will also be a consolation derived from the things contained in the Revelation, consisting
in the reflection that the dross and impurities of systems and theories
have become purged off, or rather repulsed by the truth which is
positive and eternal.
The claims which I would prefer, are that the conclusions offered
are correctly and instinctively arrived at; inasmuch as I become
associated with the various spheres of intellectual development and
progression, and by this means am enabled to communicate that
which exists in the sphere or state of existence below that in which I
am situated. Of' this I have spoken before: and the inquiring mind
is solicited to venerate the truth as it is herein presented, and as it
may be convincing to his understanding.  Such truth should be venerated only the same as it should be if it had been conceived of and
accumulated by any other process.
In speaking incidentally of theories which have been founded on
Nature and her laws alone, and in explaining the cause of such being
produced, the impossibility of their enwtire incorrectness has been
shown, with the intention of calling up these latter contemplations.
It has not been the intention to demonstrate the yroduction and sutbs'tance of Spirit, but the intention has been to prove its existnclce;
and by doing this, to establish the idea of a corresponding, yet
Eternal, Omnipotent Productor. And these two have been established by indirect and direct appeals to the general and universal
manifestations of Nature and her inherent laws.  And the unchanoeable and undeviating connexion and progress of all parts that compose the Universe being established, the mind is thus led back to the
potential laws of causation, and forward to the natural and positive
result of material perfection.
A definite understanding can not be had of these two important
subjects until they are explained, or rather developed in the progress
of the Revelation.  But the First, or the Great Positive Mind, and
the Ultimate —the Negative —or the Spirit of man, have been conclusions irresistibly received from the various appeals made to Nature,
and the experience of men who are associated with her laws.  Her
prominent principles, as developed through the received palaetiological sciences, have been connectively investigat(ed and set forth in this

key, in order to convince the mind of the possibility of spiritual
existence.  And to make the train of argument still more impressive
and certain, it was shown that it must of necessity exist, according
to the Nature and essence of its Productor, and the principles and
laws which govern all things that are of a like eternal nature.  Thus
Spirit must of necessity exist, to correspond with all other existences
that by these continued operations are constantly being developed.
Matter and spirit have heretofore been supposed to constitute two
distinct and independent substances, the latter not having any mateuial origin.  And minds not being able to comprehend this classification, have been driven to extreme and illegitimate conclusions.
And this would naturally tend, more than any other classification,
to produce a disbelief in the united action of Nature.  Instead of
making material and spiritual existence totally disconnected, the
object and intention of the foregoing has been to prove by acknowledged laws and principles of matter, the production of Intelligcnce,
the peifection of which is Spirit; and to unite the whole operations:and mutations of Nature's inherent properties of Motion, Life, and
Sensation, from the Great Positive Mind through all intermediate
things, to Man; to show that in Man this eternal principle of Spiritual Nature becomes individuclized, -and that the First operated
through Nature as a Second, to produce Spirit as a Third and grand
ftesult.
The former conclusion, then, may be again repeated, in order to
impress the mind still more strongly with the perfect harmony existing in all things,-That the Organizer and Great Positive Mind
uses Nature and all things therein, as an Effect, to produce Spirit as
an End and designed Ultimate.
~ 37. For a proper comprehension of the QUALITIES and ATTRIBUTES contained in the Great Fountain of Causation, and unfolded in
the various stages of material progression, it can not be inappropriate to
appeal to visible and invisible truths and facts in Nature and experience. And by receiving almost the whole truth in reference to the
First Cause, and the various attributes of its nature, the mind would
be prepared to enter the higher stages or spheres of the Revelation:

and this would also prepare the mind, if well-constituted and directed,
to perceive the close and connected order of development existing
between the Beginning and the End of all things.
Thoughts, feelings, desires, and passions, which are existing in the
minds of men, are not appealed to, to respond to what is herein contained. It can only be properly conceived of, and comprehended,
by the Reason and the internal light of the love of Truth. And
Reason will respond to this, if properly developed, and disconnected
from all improper interests, or interruptive external influences, during
the investigation.
The rational and well-organized mind has an unquenchable thirst to
search and inquire after the First Cause. And this is conceived of
by observing the causes and effects which are constantly developing
themselves and acting in all particles composing the Universe. Every effect presented to the mind, presupposes an adequate cause for
its appearance and development; and the chain of causes and effects
which are performing their operations in all parts of Nature, is to the
generalizing mind, unbroken.  All inductive philosophy, together
with all conclusions based upon palaetiological researches, converge
to one point —that of the First Catuse of all things. All Nature, in
hler powerful and energetic movements, operating upon principles
which can not be misinterpreted, proclaims to the mind the truth of
the Great, Positive, Omnipotent Mind.
The mind must of necessity have some foundation whereupon it
may rest, as it must investigate from a point established.  The indications of Nature are of such a character as of themselves to convey
a conception of the First Cause of all subordinate existences.  Reasoning from the established axiom that tilere must be a Beginning, or
a First Cause, to produce corresponding ones, it follows that either
1Izatter has existed from all eternity, or else the essence of an intelligent First Cause.  One or the other of these conclusions must of
necessity be drawn from the indications which all external substances
and forms present.  The idea is indisputable that something must
have origtn(ally existed to produce that which does now exist; that
TMatter and Motion must have existed independently, or that the
Great Cause must have been the Productor of that which does exist. The mind, therefore, is led back from effect to cause, until it
conceives of the First Cause, or rather is compelled to admit the
existence of such.

;106            THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
The conclusion drawn from this reasoning must be irresistible,
since Nature presents indications which constantly carry the mind
through its connected chains of progression to a true conception of
a FI1irst Existence, and of that which is to be produced.  There must
bie a Be.,-ginninTg', and also an Ultimate: and of this all things afford
demonstration to the mind.
The mechanical forces which are constantly being developed, and
the chemical properties and affinities existing in all things, are manifestly of a corresponding nature.  The motive powers and vital energies of the vegetable and animal kingdoms; the perfect exchanging
and reproduction of all parts; the decided development of perception
and volition; the inherent properties contained in the subtle fluid
which is producing these phenomena; and finally the beauty and perfection of the human organization; its power, and the consciousness
that the mind is capable of conceiving ideas and thoughts even transcending the power of expression-all these wonderful manifestations
and developments move the mind with a deep and solemn veneration
for that which first existed.
Again, the bone, the flesh, solids, nerves, skin, nails, and hair, are
composed of elements which no chemical process yet known can
fully unfold and demonstrate.  All things so refined, so rarified, as
to be beyond the reach of any known process of chemical analysis.:and as to exclude the possibility of a full demonstration to the mind
of their internal essences and qualities, require some other means besides sciences yet learned, to unfold the interior truths which they
contain.  Therefore from original Matter and the mechanical powers
which it displayed, to the inherent particles and properties composing
the human organization, there is presented to the mind one broad
and extended field of united action and motion, operating upon the
principle of cause and effect, until effects have become so apparently
disconnected from the Origrinal Cause, that the mind has no basis, no
cadence, no bounds to its conceptions; and hence it receives or repulses in a hasty and unqualified manner, that which should not be
quickly either grasped or rejected.  Hence, too, it is that belief or
disbelief is so impecratively enforced in the intellectual world upon all
subjects relating to an inherent, invisible Cause of all else existing.
It is by such thoughts as the foregoing that a conception of the
First Cause is forced upon the mind of the investigator. And in
reference to this great subject he argues as follows: Some principle,
some substance, must have previously existed, or things which do

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                  107
exist could not have existed.  He can not conceive that from nothing, soineth/ting could have been produced and organized into forms
such as are evident to his senses; for Effect could not exist without
Cause.  But he finds all beyond this axiom to be clothed in impenetrable darkness and mystery; and therefore he searches no further.
He is convinced of the uselessness of asking Nature or his own mind,
What was the beginning?  What form must the First Cause originally and eternally have assumed? Or what motive, desire, and ultimate design, must have determined the action of the Eternal Mind?
All things are effects, ends, and uses; or, in other words, they are
instruments and agents to develop externally that which they inherently contain.  The internal contemplation of the First Cause is of
itself a chaos of contemplation.  Therefore we will now take for
granted the established and universally-admitted axiom of the First
Cause, and speak of the ATTRIBUTES which are constantly flowing
from this Eternal Source, through the bodies of the stellar and solar
systems, the earth, vegetable and animal existence, Mankind, and
Intelligence.
These attributes are distinctly displayed throughout every department of Nature, and in all things therein contained; and uniting (as:
all other principles invariably and unchangeably do), they form eacl
successive link in the great chain of universal progression and development.  And so, in contemplating the First Cause, a correct idea
is obtained of its Nature as an Eternal Mind!
~ 3S. No possible combination of figures would be adequate to
present to the human mind the number of spheres contained in the
broad ocean of the stellar system.  If each particle of matter composing this sphere could be numbered, the whole would not even
convey an idea of the number of worlds contained in infinite
space! A constant formation is taking place in every part of the
Universe.  Each of these parts is changing and exchanging; and
particles are thrown from existing spheres and added to others, or
unite in forming new ones. There is a universal condensation and
consolidation of mnatter constantly going on, caused by the dissipation
or repulsion of that heat and ether which it contained in its fluid state;
and consequently there is a constant reception and rejection of particles taking place between all bodies in the Universe.  This constant
formation, creation, or rather reproduction, is caused by the law
originally instituted, and which is perpetually discharging its legitimat/

office. Besides this, there is no disqualification of the united Whole
to produce essential and particular results.  Also the universal motion and recreative activity of the Whole, is caused by the same progressive law that produces the modifications and refinements which
are constantly observed in the parts: and hence the Whole becomes
fitted for different spheres of association.
Orbs, planets, spheres, are thus organized; and the whole plane
of the solar system is presented in corresponding formations to
the mind.  Thus are represented the constant, unchangeable action
of all things, and the ascending forms which each assumes; and thus
is represented the mighty power which eternally acts through the
Whole!
There are therefore centres around which innumerable planets revolve; and planets revolve around these again: and thus one circle
after another is developed.  Like the sun and its planets, there is
formed one sphere of action, around which subordinate spheres move
with undeviating and mathematical precision, until from the centre
outward there are concentric circles constantly developed from the
one circle, until the farthest point of its powerful and controlling influence is attained.
Conceive of the sun, its planets, and their satellites-their composition, and the offices which they perform-and you will be able,
by the laws of analogy, to indefinitely comprehend the movements of
infinite space, and to conceive of the innumerable suns and centres
of like motion and activity.  For each sphere or orb in boundless
space may be conceived of and comprehended by the light of analogy. Contemplate a Power so great, so omnipotent, so eternal, as to
institute a Law in matter which thus produces what is known to be
existing! Meditate upon the unimaginable number of spheres that
are contained below, around, and above your more transient theatre
of existence; and let the thoughts which are contemplating the things
and powers that are contained in the celestial spheres of existence,
be no less active. And think of the omnipotent force and power
which they manifest in all their united and harmonious motions!
You thus have a perfect system of material formation, supported by
an invisible Power and Law, perfect in all its forces and motions
which are openly observed and known to exist!
There can be no thought profound and expansive enough to comprehend the overwhelming idea of Infinite Power! For this power
is no less perfect in the solar syste'n than it is in all the systems and

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                 1 09
kingdoms existing upon this earthly sphere which you are associated
with.  It is manifest in the various divisions of formation; in the
general kingdoms which have been progressively developed; and in
the perfect and efficacious process by which they are constantly and
unchangeably being produced.  In every kingdom  of the physical
and organic formations of the earth, there is evinced an inexhaustible, incomprehensible, and omnipotent force, which actuates them
and all their developments and reproductions! So perfect is this
force, so harmonious and beautiful is its action, that nothing is destroyed or annihilated; but all things answer the end for which they
were originally designed.  And both in a minute and general field
of observation, the same power may be seen as unchangeably active
in the production and purification of particles, as also in causing their
association with those of like affinity, until the very substance of Sensation is developed into Intelligence; and then intelligence, as a refinement of all else existing, can associate with all corresponding
intelligence. And thus the reason is made manifest why the mind
is pleased to associate with that of an intellectual nature.  It is thus
able to conceive of Intelligence in Omnipotence.
The earth and all things therein contained, and the system which
is above, below, and occupying all space, unite in all their unspeakable manifestations in impressing the mind with that deep and solemn
truth which is the great pillar of all truth, that the Great First Cause
possesses as one attribute, the essence, the quality of unimaginable, incomprehensible, and eternal PowER! The impressions received
firom all these manifestations are irresistibly subduing, convincing,
and wonderful!  The expressions which are used by Nature to convey such a conclusion, are of such a character that the internal mnan
only can receive and associate with them.  The evidences of such
can not be adequately expressed by man; but they are demonstratively convincing and penetrating, as the inward voice of.all Nature., 39. Thus the foregoing train of remark establishes the eternal
attribute of Omnipotence. -And while observing the powerful movements of all things contained in the terrestrial and celestial spheres,
there can not but be a conception of DIVINE WISDOM legitimately
accompanying the former conclusion. The innumerable centres of
the stellar system; the many suns, with their accompanying orbs,
planets, and satellites; the perfect precision of the general movements
of all these bodies; their regular and connected adjustment and- unity;

110             THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.
the distributive harmony and equilibrium of forces and motions which
they constantly display-are all manifestations of grandeur, beauty,
and order unspeakable. The regular inclinations of orbits and axes,
and the definite distances of globes from each other; their constant
sameness of motion, and the uniform direction which all take; the apparent sympathy and reciprocation of the spheres and atmospheres of
the innumerable and apparently-independent bodies; the united and
constant action which each of these manifests-all conspire to force
upon the mind the irresistible impression that the great and united
movements of the Universe are all being performed according to a
most inconceivably-perfect adjustment of mathematical and mechani
cal laws, and that all things are guided in the very motions of their
inherent life and activity, by the essence of Omnipotent WISDOM!
Their formation and procreation; their particles and constituent parts
manifest in their order and arrangement, the perfection of pure Wisdom and Intelligence- while their numerical extent and diverse
modes of development, infinitely transcend the highest powers of humnan calculation and demonstration.  No process of analogical reasoning or of mathematical calculation has yet reached that point of
perfection by which may be demonstrated and calculated the exact
distances at which these spheres revolve, the immensity of space
which they occupy, and the harmony of the Whole!
Again: Geological investigators have decided upon the relative
eras at which the various formations were gradually produced.
Also that the various strata, from the first to the last, were successively developed, according to the induction received from the internal appearances which they now present.
Accompanying each of these developments, were corresponding
productions of vegetable and animal life. And whether the chain is
unbroken from the first development of living species to those which
now exist, is a question which has no essential bearing upon the inductions legitimately received; for the generalization of the geological and
physiological sciences leads to corresponding universal truths. Therefore the orderly development of the earth, and of accompanying and
corresponding organic beings, manifests unspeakable WVisdom and
Design!
So also throughout the labyrinths of the many inferior developments up to Man, is the same constantly observed. The operation
of Nature upon the principle of cause and effect; the succession of
the four seasons; of day and night; the continued production and

THE PRINCIPLES OF NALTURE.               111
reproduction of all things, as determined by the constant and harmonious operations of these last principles in Nature, and which cause
the fertility of the earth; the constant perfecting and purification of
all particles composing the material and organic universe; the coinparative repose of the functions of vegetable life, dturing the hours
of darkness, so as to produce mature perfection,- all these speak
decisively and impressively of unbounded [Wisdom!
And there is a time also for human physical repose, in order that
the many organs and functions of the body may regain what has been
expended during the hours of activity, so that there may be a constant and uniform supply of materials and forces generated hourly
and secondly, by the energetic movements of the organization.
Contemplation on the structure and mutual adaptation of all the parts
of the latter, and the uses therein manifested; on the essential
chemical properties and qualities composing the fluids and solids;
the regular reaction and transmutation of each particle of the solid
and fluid substances of the body; the harmonious and undeviating
law upon which the whole is sustained, developing cause, effect, and
end, in every motion and particle of its organization, —all these, connected with the previous contemplations, carry to the mind the internal and deep conviction, that from the planetary system to geological
formations and developments, vegetable and animal creations, and
Man, all things are ordered and arranged by Divine TWisdom.
The law of gravitation; of repulsion; of progression; —also the
evaporation and refinement of particles existing upon the face of
Nature; the immense and inconceivable good.which is thus constantly being produced; finally, the beauty and harmony of ALL
THINGS; the. Cause, Effect, and End; the Design; the uses; the
unchangeable and eternal simplicity of movements externally manifested, still which are too immense and powerful to be comlprehended,-speak only the voice of eternal Power and Wisdom!
And the mind thus contemplating Nature and all her various forcesand motions, receives distinct and impressive truths from the universals of existence, that kindle within it an intellectual flame of reverence and adoration! And by steady and profound meditation, this
will burn and brighten, and purify the internal principle of organic
life. And the field of such meditations is unbounded, inasmuch ax
thoughts themselves are inadequate to conceive of the high and
deep Wisdom emanating from the Great Cause of causation!

~ 40. And while admiring the wisdom as seen and felt in all things
around and above, the mind is impressed still more deeply, and with
a clearer perception, with an attribute still more perfect, viz., that of
GOODNESS! The incalculable number of worlds which the mind has
previously contemplated, with their power of action and wise adjustmelnt of motion, display goodness and design in all their various
spheres and states of activity.  Goodness is manifested in the fact
that each law of a positive nature produces effects of anegative nature; and the equilibrium existing between all motions and forces,
causes the principle of goodness to be displayed from the very centre
to the circumference of their united actions. And also all the palmtiological sciences, when traced to the present time, or retraced to
causes anterior, show the constant adaptation and succession of parts
serving as agents and instruments to produce future effects, and which
produce others still, until the whole, up to the formation of Man.
presents a united chain of progression, —a system  of concentric
circles of development,-and the Whole displays beauty, purpose,
and design. Each successive circle evinces an infinite amount of
power, wisdom, and goodness, until all combined produce Man as
an Ultimate-and that these all were essential principles and operations carried through Nature, for the very purpose of producing this
sublime Result!
And as Man contains the perfected and refined substances of all
else existing, he stands as an emblem of this great Attribute.  For
man, through this principle of goodness, possesses an intellectual
composition whereby he exercises power, wisdom, and goodness, over
all below his exalted state, in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
And that the earth might be made useful, and that plants and animals
might add to the usefulness thereof, it was plositively necessary and
good that they should have a lord and governor.  If all things below
the composition of man were existing without him, there could be
no good results seen, known, or appreciated. For then the life of
plants, and the sensation and instinct of animals, would have been
the highest developments, and there would have been no further perfection of the same principle. Consequently, according to the laws
of wisdom and goodness, Man, with all his physical powers and his
capacities of mind to exercise judgment and justice toward all things,
conceives, by the action of his inner principle, the perfect adaptation
of all things to him, and also of the perfecting of all things approximating to him, so that he may subsist upon the constant production

and refinement of the elements and substances contained in the various inferior kingdoms. And thus he is a controller, inventor, and
designer, in respect to all things thus presented for his meditation
and use.
This perfect adaptation and harmony of all things, thus sends
forth throughout the Universe the unchangeable message of the
divine attributes of infinite Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; and in
so impressive a manner that expression does not answer as a proper
means to convey the thoughts caused thereby!
~ 41. Again: Throughout all this vast ocean of organic life, all
known laws, forces, and motions, whether in the celestial spheres or
on this present globe, are acknowledged to perform their office
(unless incidentally obstructed), with the most perfect Justice and
Equity. And again, as the material constituents of all things aro
combined in the constitution of Man, he can exemplify this principle,
and thus a true conception of corresponding Justice may be obtained'
The laws that govern the organic and mental constitution, are operating, according to their nature, with a steady and undisturbed actions.
But if any of these laws are interfered with by any incidental or irttentional impediment or violation, they bring with them corresponding
natural results.  If all the demands of the physiological law are not
properly and justly obeyed; if this law is in any way interfered withy
or violated in any particular or general sense, there must, and of
necessity will be, a corresponding result following the violation.
Likewise the mental law, if violated or disregarded as to its
demands upon the being subject to it, will in all instances produce a
corresponding result.' And therefore if the physiological and intellectual laws are at any time interrupted in their movements by any.
cause foreign or immediate, they will illustrate and demonstrate to
the mind the perfect harmony that exists in alli the motions and laws:
of Nature-that they are equal and just; and that good or evil
results must of necessity be produced according as they are obeyed
or disobeyed.
For all movements must produce natural results.  Hence if any;
law is impeded, it produces as a consequence, impfure results; but if
not interfered with, but obeyed ini all its requirements and demands~.
it will produce pure and happy results.  Therefore there is constantly in operation the law and principle of Goodness, to, produce,

ruption of its forces produces impure results. And between the
pure and impure; between goodness and its legitimate effects; between harmony and disunion, may be seen still more distinctly the
infinite attribute of never-ending JUSTICE!
Thus Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, are combined in the general and specific compositions of all things. from the lowest, up to
and in Man. They point to the united and infinite Source from
which they emanated, —and develop the principle of eternal Justice,
which is universally displayed among every class and species existing in the terrestrial spheres.  And the whole is indicative of higher
and more perfect attributes, which will be gradually manifested,
directly and indirectly, in the various portions of the Revelation.
The bodies and spheres contained in the immensity of inconceivable space, thus follow in order the powerful Law by which they are
produced and governed, and that with inconceivable precision, unifobrmity of motion, and reciprocal actions upon each other.  The
perpetual and mutual intervolutions and revolutions; the strict exactness of the specific forces and motions uniformly existing in each
part and particle composing the celestial spheres; the beauty and
harmony displayed in these motions with respect to each other, and
around their respective centres, and the perfect precision manifested
in every line and path in which they travel, —throwing off particles
and attracting the refined ones of others; the constant, reciprocal,
and universal sympathy which they display, —manifest in their general, indications, the divine attribute of Melekness, Compassion, and
M'rcy. Each motion, action, and force, observed in the planetary
system, is a true and correct signal of distributive Justice and
infinite Mercy!
Individual and isolated observations, apparently disconnected with
the universal law of motion, will impress still more deeply upon the
mind this irresistible conclusion. Still in descending from the general observation to the particular and'individual manifestations of
this attribute, the mind should not lose sight of its revealment in the
great and universal Law of Nature.
~ The known evidences contained and revealed in the traditional
histories of the world, including the many investigations into the material and physical sciences, and the well-established axioms that
have been set forth in the many contemplations of Nature and

THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURE.                 118
Art, carry with them conviction of the indestructible attribute under
consideration.
The natural developments of the earth, from the grosser stages up
to the animal creation, unfold one united and harmonious chain of
progression. And Life, Sensation, and Intelligence, have also followed in their respective orders, as the legitimate results of inherent
and eternal laws. Throughout the whole vegetable kingdom, there is
observed between different forms a constant giving to and taking from
each other of particles, in order that one may sustain another, and that
thus the kingdom as a whole may be sustained: and thus also is developed the truth of universal Reciprocation, Kindness, and Mercy..
This harmony, this universal sympathy, kindness, benevolence,
and charity, corresponds to the great and inifinite attribute of divine
and unspeakable Compassion, and must of necessity accompany other
eternal attributes that are contained in the Great Fountain of all
existence.
The animals display more lenity, more unqualified compassion, and
more instinctive justice, than are often known to be displayed by the
perverted and misdirected principles of mankind. They also display
unqualified mercy and instinctive attachment. From the lower to the
higher states of animal existence, there is one chain of universal symnpathy, justice, and benevolence, corresponding to the harmonious
reciprocations observed in the vegetable kingdom -also to the exalted
and unperverted morality of universal humanity. The vegetable and
animal forms of material production therefore manifest sympathy and
mercy, corresponding to what is observed in the planetary worlds.
And Aian, the refined and exalted perfection of all else- the unlimited governor and controller of his own being-possesses the combined refinements of Justice, Mercy, and Benevolence, known as the
unspeakable blessing —the faculty of unclouded REASON. By this
he may understand Truth, and subdue all artificial feelings and desires illegitimately evolved from his nature; and he thus stands as a;
perfect standard and emblem of distributive Justice, universal Compassion and Mercy.  It is his highest attainment —it is his most
happy and blessed condition of existence-to exercise judgment and
justice without distinction.  And thus, from man to animals, with
their constant mental developments; and from these to vegetables,
with their sympathy and equality of action; and from these to the
material sphere which contains these all; and thence throughout the
immensity of universal space, —there is an indestructible impressior

conveyed of reciprocation, harmony, beauty, and magnificence; justice, mercy, sympathy, and eternal benevolence 
~ 42. The profound meditations on the infinitude of Splace, induce upon the mind the parallel conception of infinite Tinme. For
time and space are parallel and synonymous in signification; but a:;
a distinction is made between them, and is universally acknowledged,
it will not be disregarded,-but we will continue the association of
thoughts as thus conceived.
The surface of the earth may be compared to infinite space and
time, as conceived of by the human mind. The various and innumerable forms, planets, and bodies, existing in space, may be compared with the forms, bodies, and organizations, here existing.  For
each celestial sphere can be no more than a form that matter has
assumed in obedience to its omnipotent law of progression. The
forms and entities here existing, are no more than modifications and
correspondent productions of the material elements composing the
Universe. All bodies upon the earth are sustained upon its surface
by laws acting in connexion and correspondence with the universal
law of Cause, Effect, and End. The atmosphere of this sphere
holds to the same the many living beings and entities that are existing upon its surface. And each other sphere has, again, its atmosphere, as corresponding to the earth's atmosphere, - governed by
the laws of attraction and repulsion, or inspiration and exhalation, influx and reflux, giving to and taking from. And this whole chain
performs its specific duties on laws corresponding to those of the
most refined and exalted sphere in the regions of infinity.
Therefore a correspondence and positive analogy may be observed
as existing between and connecting all things emanating from the
Great Sphere or Focus of the Great Positive Mind. There is a
perfect and successive gradation and established juxtaposition manifested in all forms and entities, both visible and invisible, terrestrial
and celestial; and the whole are governed by the perpetual, uniform
action of the former combined attributes, whose law is thus powerful,
wise, and good.
Justice and Mercy are thus legitimate attendants of the formel
principles combined; and from the first attribute to the last, and from
the combination of the whole as forming the conception of infinite
Perfection, there is developed and expressed in all things, visible
and invisible, the unspeakable attribute of ETERNAL TRUTH!

THE PRfNCIPLES OF NATURE.                  11.7
Thus Power first existed. Further development showed infinite
TWisdom; still further, unbounded Goodness!  And again, Motion
becoming refined and perfected into Sensation and Life (corresponding to the celestial life of the planetary spheres), shows the great law
and attribute of universal Jzustice.  And by the constant sympathy,
kindness, and benevolence, manifested in the imperceptible reciprocation of all their parts and particles, there is developed another attribute -that of eternal and impartial Mercy!
The contemplation of unlimited space and time, and the recognition of the perfect analogy between space and the surface of this
earth-between forms and entities therein contained, and forms and
entities existing on the earth,-give a correct idea (so far as it is
possible to conceive of one) of the universal creation and procreation
of all forms and spheres contained in boundless space, as corresponding to those existing on this globe.
Compare world with world; space with time; form with form;
particles with the whole fabric of existence; cause with effect; effect
with ultimate, and that with design. Then investigate the hidden
laws of material and organic motion. Keep in view, in this whole
train of contemplation, the great original Mined, the Cause of all
things known as effects, and of that which is not visually known, but
which does exist-the ultimate of material perfection.  Conceive
once more of the great archwork of Nature, and how it was produced.
Contemplate still more deeply the causes which the effects prove to
exist; and the conception —the subduing and tranquillizing knowledge
-will be produced in the mind, that the very perfection, the highest
possible refinement, of the former attributes, the very nature and essential quality of the Great Positive Mind, is unchangeable and eternal TRUTH!
There is not one feature in Nature that presents itself to the general observer, which is not stamped with the impress of its divine
origin. The same may be observed in every planet; in every form
and sphere of the mineral and vegetable world; in every modification of anatomy and form in the plant. So also does the animal
creation bear this indestructible impress, by its undeviating and unrestricted harmony, and its production and reorganization that are constantly going on, and are manifested throughout all its various spheres
up to Mankind. And the physical and mental composition of man,
his faculties and capacities, are still onward in their progressive tendency to their sublime results. And all these things are expressions

of unchangeable Truth, of divine Perfection, and of an eternal principle of divine Intelligence.
Thus Power, Wisdom, Goodness —Justice, Mercy, and Truthare the gradual and successive developments of an eternal and internal Principle, constituting the divine, original Essence!
Thus, then, are established the law of progression; of development; the science of correspondences; the doctrine of concentric
circles; the idea of an endless chain of eternal action, motion, and
development, throughout all Nature; the immortality of all things in
a purified and perfected state of existence; the unity and harmony
of all things, and the impossibility of a positive opposite to exist in
Nature or any of her apartments or spheres of united and progressive
movement.
~ 43. The all-pervading Essence contained in Nature is of itself
an eternal and immortal Principle.  Every particle of matter at some
time during the course of ages passes through, and becomes a part
of, animanl life! The hardest substance that is existing in the earth;
the earth itself, and all things contained in, below, and above it, will
ultimately, and at different periods, compose some parts or particles
of animal existence.  According to the progression of each part,
there is an equal association of the same with that of like affinity.
l'cr the substance of the earth progresses to that of mineral and crystallized bodies; then becomes such: and these progress to the substance of the vegetable, and then become vegetable matter: this to
animal, and then enters into the composition of animal existence;
and then, purified from all lower spheres and states which it has preriously occupied, the whole becomes perfected to associate with and
compose the organization of Mankind.  Thence it goes onward te
other states of refined and unparticled matter.
This demonstrates conclusively to the profound investigator and
searcher into Nature's inherent qualities and specific laws, that all
matter composing orbs and planets, all entities, from the highest in
the planetary system to this —that every particle in all these must
of necessity become at some time the associate, the quality, the composition, of animal life!
This movement and constant refinement and perfection, is imperceptible to the senses, because it is gradual and eternal, while the
senses are finite and evanescent- existing but a moment in comnari

son to the other existences, and are consequently not capable of palpable and cognizant conviction. For finite and infinite are extremes
to the mind seemingly disconnected; therefore mlan can not be cognizant of the internal movements of the Universe.
Forms and entities are mere modifications of original matter, which
assumes states of material association and composition according to
its degree of progression.  Forms are therefore but finite and external-are fleeting and evanescent in comparison to the imperceptible
motion of gross matter.  For all things are assuming forms, not only
as necessary results, but as uses to develop new truths and' principles, and for the purification and organization of higher and more
perfect forms of life.
Man is pre-eminently beautiful, as he contains all things else in a
state of purity; and he, like other results of Nature, is a designed
instrualcnt-is a use-to develop a more sublime Ultimate.
All forms, therefore, are external effects, and are mortal.  They
can not be depended upon as affording proofs of immortality, or as
demonstrating even the probability of a future life.  But there is an
internal, invisible Quality and Essence that may be found by search
and analysis to be the Truth of all truths, and the Real of all realities-the internal Principle of the Eternal Positive Mind!
The First and Last, or the Cause and Ultimate, which it has been
the object to prove and demonstrate to the rational mind, is the existence, the reality, the true conception, of an intelligent First Cause
(and this has been proved from all the palaetiological sciences, and
all the philosophical inductions of Nature), and the positive individualization of the inner life, or spiritual principle. — And the last has
been shown from the irresistible conclusions drawn from the physical
sciences, together with philosophy, reason, and the approbations of a
comprehensive intelligence, to be more than a pr'obuble possibilityand actually demonstrated to be a real reality-to be the natural
result, but still a perfect and eternal one, of the material organization.
Therefore, as the First and Last have been positively proved,
the Key has now done its specific duty, by having prepared the mind;o contemplate that which is still higher, yet connected with all things
existing in an inferior degree.  And as Nature has been proved to
be a combined Effect of the First Cause, and Spirit an Ultimate.
Nature therefore stands as a mediator between disbelief and present
conviction; and upon her and her laws, as a foundation (speaking

the Revelation —which will prog'ressively reveal every visible and
invisible existence, until it arrives at the highest Sphere of perfection; and then will retrace the links of development back to the
original Cause and Foundation of all things.
During the delivery of this Key, I have occupied a Sphere second
to this in mental refinement and perfection. And to reveal the Second Sphere, I progress or ascend to the Third; thence to the
Fourth; thence onward and upward to the Fifth, Sixth, and finally,
as an ultimate, to the Seventh-in which Sphere I shall be able to
comprehend all others. Then from this, again, I shall descend to
that which I now occupy. And the whole is to be in accordance
with the laws of Universal TRUTH, as the Perfection and Ultimate
of all the other attributes belonging to the GREAT POSITIVE MIND!

PART II.
OR,
NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
~ 1. IN THE BEGINNING, the Univerccelum was one boundless,
undefinable, and unimaginable ocean of LIQUID FIRE!. Tile most
vigorous and ambitious imagination is not capable of forming an adequate conception of the height, and depth, and length, and breadth
thereof.  There was one vast expanse of liquid substance.  It was
without bounds —inconceivable - and with qualities and essences
incomprehensible. This was the original condition of MATTER. It
was without forms; for it was but one Form.  It had not motions;
but it was an eternity of Motion.  It was without parts; for it was a
Whole.  Particles did not exist; but the Whole was as one Particle.
There were not Suns, but it was one Eternal Sun. It had no beginning, and it was without end. It had not length; for it was a Vortex of one Eternity. It had not circles; for it was one infinite
Circle. It had not disconnected power; but it was the very essence
of all Power.  Its inconceivable magnitude and constitution were
such as not to develop forces, but Omnipotent Power!
Matter and Power were existing as a Whole, inseparable.  The
l31atter contained the substance to produce all suns, all worlds, and
systems of worlds, throughout the immensity of space. It contained
the qualities to produce all things that are existing upon each of
these worlds.  The Power contained Wisdom  and Goodness,Justice, Mercy, and Truth.  It contained the original and essential
Principle that is displayed throughout immensity of space, controlling worlds and systems of worlds, and producing Motion, Life,

Sensation, and Intelligence, to be impartially disseminated upon their
surfaces as Ultimates!
This Great Centre of worlds —this Great Power of Intelligencethis Great Germ of all existences-was ONE WORLD!  corresponding to a globe visible: for it was but One —containing the materials and Power to produce all others.  It had WIisdom equal to
Matter, to plan them  and direct their ilfinite movements.  It had
Goodness equal to the extent of its substance, to give perfect harmony
and distributive usefulness to all parts of this Infinitude.  It had Jus
lice; but only to be manifested in proportion to developments of suitable mediums upon these subordinate spheres, or forms of the Great
Sphere.  It had Mercy, Lenity, and Forbearance, to be developed
as corresponding with like developments in sensitive and intelligent
beings.  It contained Truth eternalized, like its own nature.  So
the whole of these principles were joined into one vast Vortex of
Fure Intellience!
Thus, Matter and Motion are co-eternal principles, established by
virtue of their own nature; and they were the Germ, containing all
properties, all essences, all principles, to produce all other forms and
spheres that are now known to be existing.  The great original Mass
was a substance containing within itself the embryo of its own perfection.  It became pregnated by virtue of its own laws, and was
controlled, guided, and perfected, by virtue of its own omnipotent.Power!
Crystallization and organic life being the two general developments
belonging to the Mundus of spheres, there was nothing existing as
things are now known to exist: for it was one Sphere, one Substance,
one Germ, one Cause, containing the power to produce all the systems that are now swimming in the vacuum of undefinable space. It
contained the power of progression, but had not progressed.
Therefore Matter and Power were the only Principles developed;
and there were no other sphe'res of progression.  This great Mass
of Matter abounded with heat and fire immense, insomuch that each
seeming particle was in reality not such, but the Whole was a mass
of liquid lava. The elements then developed were Light and Heat.
The Power contained in this great Vortex was the GREAT POSITIVE
MINDI!-and its development was ETERNAL MOTION! And so
Matter and Motion constituted the original condition of all things!
Matter contained all the attributes, characteristics, essential qualities, and peculiar combinations, which the whole Univercoelum mani

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                123
fests.  No limits could be given to its inconceivable extension, no
combination of numbers could represent its diameter, and no conception of form could be properly applied to its appearance! For Cause
and Effect were involved in one universal Motion, undulating almost
its own immensity! No parts were acting upon other parts, but the
Whole was acting by virtue of its own internal power, which was of
inconceivable greatness. No name or quality can properly represent its original substance: for the whole was flaming with internal
heat, which evolved, as an effect, the principle of Light.
So Matter, Heat, and Light, constituted the primitive condition of
the material, eternal Substance.  Possessing all these essential qualities, characteristics, and compounds, it was suitable to produce all.hings which have been produced, and to be the Cause and Effect to
produce indeterminable Ultimates.  Its ultimate purification would
necessarily produce the peculiar essence of animal life and Intelligence.  The very essence that it contained, would inevitably breathe
forth the amazing and indescribable qualities that characterize all the
organic kingdoms!  The Terra and Terminus were both combined
in this great Ocean of unparticled substance. This contained the
parts to produce all things subsequently created.  It was the Cause
of an eternalized system of concentric spheres of heavens which
were and are the very Foundation and Cause of all that is terrestrial
and corporeal, yet developing that which is celestial and heavenly.
The original form was angular.  This contained the principle and.nature of all other forms: so that from the lowest and intermediate
forms up to the highest, could be constantly produced other forms
accompanied with, and controlled and acted upon by, the Great Positive Power. Progression of the angular evolved the circular.
This assumed, not a spherical constitution, but it was a combination
of angular and rectilinear plane.  Therefore the continuance of the
angular to the circular was only a perpetually progressive form,
ascending toward the slpiral.  And this developed diameters, axes,
and poles, containing the perpetual angular, and progressed to a still
higher and more perfect form, that of the vortical, properly the
celestial.
Thus from the lowest to this sphere of progression, there was a
constant development of inherent principles and laws, the lower containing the higher, and the perfected comprehending all below it.
The perpetual vortical or celestial, was the Spiritual; in which there
is nothing but what is refined, pure, and everlastingly infinite, con-,

124           NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
taining unspeakable and celestial glory, brightness, and grandeur.  It
is the Vortex, the inconceivably perfect and spontaneous substance
of the GREAT POSITIVE MIND!
The greatest comprehends the lesser, still that which was first,
though is not developed except by order and virtue of degreed
progression. And so each state assumed new qualities and involved
new developments, until the highest put forth its everlasting brightness, an index of its own origin!
~ 2. Matter and Motion reigned throughout the regions of boundless infinitude.  Thiere were no other forms and no other attributes
evolved from Power; for they all existed undeveloped together.
Matter and its peculiar combinations, existed from time unimaginable, as the vehicle of more sublime Ultimates, to be eternally developed by the Design and Power which were constantly being,sent
forth from the great Vortex of Positive Power!
It was impossible for Matter to exist without a principle of inherent and eternal production.  It was impossible for this internal,
invisible, Positive Power to exist without Matter as its accompaniment and Vehicle. In order that this Matter might assumeforms,
the action of the Great Positive Power was necessary to impel it to
higher states of progression.  So the Matter, thus acted upon, was
developed until it became an external Equilibrium or Negative of
the Great Positive Power internally acting upon it. And thus Positive and Negative were eternally established in Matter. And Matter
was thus obliged to obey every impulse or force given it by the
internal Principles, emanating from the Great Positive Mind.
The Great First Cause, or the Vortex of pure Intelligence, was
a First, or Cause Internal.  Matter, with its properties and inconceivable combinations, was an accompaniment or counterpart that
may be termed a Second or Effect. And the external or countervailing force developed by the action of the Internal, was a Third or
Ultimate.
Thus was established the Law of universal and eternal MOTION.
In the beginning God created- or the Great Positive Mind causedthe existences and forms that are now universally manifested.
Having arrived at this state and order of material formation, the
true conception of Matter and Motion, of their original combination,
of the self-establishment of laws and principles suitable to develop ultimate results, and of the adjustment of laws to produce such,-are

NATURE S DIVINE. REVELATIONS.               125
made present to the mind. And this was the condition of these
elements and principles in the beginning; and they were thus prepared to develop forms corresponding to the virtue of the internal
principles involved in the Great Mass, and to the inherent Power
emanating from the Great Vortex in which nothing but everlasting
perfection is contained! Herein is involved all that is everlasting,
eternal, and infinite: And herein are established the laws that are to
govern the vast Univercoelum and all things therein contained! At
this epoch and state of infinite original constitution, all the laws,
elements, and combinations of elements, were involved in the Great
Mass, to be subsequently developed in order and succession of degrees, throughout every undefinable avenue of eternal motion, life,
and activity.
The universal Cause, Law, and Reality, is now established and
orgarized. Internal and External, Cause and Effect, Positive and
Negative, have now assumed their proper stations to produce a constant development of their inherent attributes.  The forms that are
involved in this great Whole, are to be also successively developed
and made visible, with, their consequent developments. The constitutiori and laws of Matter * with all its sublime qualities and essences,
will be unfolded ultimately, but by a process graduated by like developments of the Great energetic Cause and Positive Power.
Thi's extensive general organization having become now eternally
established, new developments must consequently and inevitably
occur. Each of these developments leads only to the perfection that
is existing in the Vortex of internal and everlasting Intelligence.
But before contemplating the spontaneous developments of this
great and unimaginable Ocean of Matter and Motion, it is well to
contemplate the substances which it contains undeveloped.
The gross and lower qualities that are contained in this great Mass;
the almost entire dissimilarity of particles constituting the same, with
any which may be present to the mind, and the great amount and
utter incomprehensibility of the original substance, give some obscurity to the lower and more perfected particles that compose this great
Vehicle of Positive Power. The mighty magnitude of this terramaterial; the duration of Eternity; the mighty substances and particles
that are destined to produce mightier spheres of beauty and perfection;
the inconceivableness of this great expanse, developing perpetually' The lecturer here remarked, that in speaking of the original condition of things,
he used Matter and Fire as synonymous.

spheres and Spheres of spheres, and forms that are indices of forms
still higher and greater in their many and successive degrees of perpetual progression,-these all are too vast for human conception!
But still, a general contemplation would be useful, as conveying
some slight idea of their nature and destination,-though the almost
vacuum of indefinite thought will only radiate and revibrate that
which was intended to be the subject of conception.
First, it contains the peculiar combinations that form a Sun so vast
that it again forms similar ones, corresponding to the great Sun or
World that was first repulsed from the great Body, or Infinite Centre!
And this is an index-a symbol-of an eternity of worlds like unto
the first launched from the great Centre to the extremity of its own
atmospheric circle.  And each having subordinate worlds, and these
having satellites, they in order revolve around each other, and
the whole around the Centre or Sun which produced them.  And
this, with all corresponding suns and constellations, attended with
their many planets and satellites, revolves around the Great Centre
or Sun friom which the whole emanated! And thus is established
the first mnotion of planetary worlds! And these having developed
upon geometrical principles, the angular, circular,;and spiral motions,
this eternal establishment becomes the first system of concentric circles!
After the great Fountain has produced from its inherent substance,
an infinite number of worlds, the worlds, or the compositions therein
contained, progress perpetually to higher states of perfection.  The
next development is the crystallization of internal particles, producing
the various earthy and mineral substances.  The highest state of
mineral, by order of degrees and progression of particles, brings forth
the great substance of the whole Vegetable Kingdom.  The lowest
of this (including, as it does, the highest), produces the most delicate
plant. This kingdom, again, constitutes, in order and degree, animal
coimposition. And this again ascending to higher and more perfect
orders and degrees, brings forth the essences and qualities that coinpose the organization of Man. And all intermediate substances
developed, are the Uses adapted to the wants and requirements of
each successive material development. So all substances, which are
constantly assuming forms by the action of the Great First Form and
its perpetual ascension to Ultimates, are in like manner ascending
through successive and corresponding stages of development.
The Mass that was first repulsed from the Great Centre of worlds,
contained the properties and essences, not only to compose itse/, but

to produce and develop the minutest and most sublimated of all intricacies, apparently, that could be formed from the finest materials:
it furnishes materials for, and produces, the brain and human ey/e, with
all their inimitable refinements of matter!
Thus, then, this great Ocean of Eternal Matter, not only is a World
immense and infinite of itself, but it contains the matter to produce
the most inconceivable corresponding World; and this again forming
others of like nature, progresses from inherent qualities to the outer
development of an organ of vision, and to the substance and formation of the mental organization!  Thus the Lowest or First contains
all else; whereas the highest state of perfection acts on the lower.
So while that which is first contains the Ultimate, the Ultimate acts
on all things below it, which, though less perfect, are still symbols of
eternal essences to be expanded and developed in visible forms and
spheres of the highest degrees of magrnificence.
~ 3. Contemplation on the Attributes contained in, and belonging
to, the Great Positive Power, would also lead the mind to properly
comprehend what is contained in the Great Vortex of infinite Perfection undeveloped. "Power is manifested in the guidance and control
of the great World evolved from the greater one. And this Power
is unlimited and uncontrolled; yet developing fWisdom in the universal expansion and extension of planetary productions.  The perfect
and inimitable adaptation of every constellation, planet, and satellite,
to the great Sun of its central motion, displays iifinite Goodness.
For Goodness is the proper adaptation of things to ends, in order to
accomplish some grand and sublime ultimate.
The proper adherence and obedience of all these planetary worlds,
to the Positive Law of Cause and Effect, each and every one obeying the original impetus given it when this eternal law was established,
displays infinite and universal Justice. For Justice and Equity consist in an obedience to the laws of Cause and ]Effect.
The proper accomplishment of the end desired by the original
Premeditator, displays the highest and most perfect attribute of Mercy.
For light is evolved from the great Centre thus established; proper
elements are developed; air is universally distributed, sufficient to
sustain life and to equalize the parts composing the great Whole, - and
all to prepare suitable habitations for vegetable and animal existences:
and this is the accomplishment of the Ultimate intended.  And in
this way is displayed the exalted and essential attribute of everlasting





## p. 128 (#156) ############################################


128            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS..Mercy; for Mercy consists in the adaptation of parts to the Whole,
and in the dissemination and sustaining of sensitive beings.
The gradual and progressive development of each form from the
condition of things first existing; the constant and inevitable manifestations occurring in every epoch or stage of Motion; the mutual
adaptation of all things which is plainly visible, and the perfect and
absolute accomplishment of the end desired, — display the perfection
of all attributes, the Ultimate of the Great Positive Mind, Eternal
TavTH! For Truth is that inherent principle of divine Law which
determines the certain and adequate accomplishment of any good and
glorious end contemplated.
Thus Power and its Vehicle constitute the Fountain from which
flow all things to ultimate perfection. The inconceivable fiery mass
of Matter, in its magnitude and constituents of composition, pass all
comprehension. And Power, wielding its mighty and energetic influence, coeternal with the substance of Matter, is of too great and
mighty a nature to be imagined or conceived of. And this was the
condition of things in the beginning.
The infinite mass of Matter developed heat and light by virtue of
inherent fire. And Power being positive, developed a Negative, or
the eternal Law of Gravitation.  Thus Motion was eternally established in and throughout the vast material composition.
The extension of the atmosphere from the Great Body, was likewise infinite. And the Great Centre or Sun constantly gave off heat
and light, each of which was a development of Matter, thrown off by
its repelling power. This superior combination, as evolved from the
Centre, was suitable for the formation of immense worlds. The substance or unparticled matter which was constantly thrown from the
Centre, became at length a nebulous Zone, surrounding the immensity
of space! By constant action and development of the particles thus
subjected to the motion of attraction, repulsion, and the laws of condensation; by a repelling of that which was averse to the process of
consolidation, and an attracting of that which was of like affinity and
suitable to become part of the same mass, the formation of worlds
was first instituted, -on the law of progression and development from
the Great Centre, until the material evolved was fitted to prod'lce a
World, and that others, corresponding to the great original Sou, ce.
The worlds thus formed were properly Suns, produced from an il:conceivable mass of unparticled matter existing before the process of
consolidation commenced.

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               129
Thus an incomprellensible and incalculable number of Centres or
Suns were produced by the development of heat and light, and their
gradual condensation. And from these were created systems of planets, each of which revolved around its controlling Centre, according to.
the development of the circular and spiral motions, and the influence
of attraction and repulsion, or the laws of centripetal and centrifugal
forces. Thefirst great Ring of converging formations was thus conlmenced and completed.
After an unimaginable elapse of time —almost the annililaltion of
time to the mind, if an attempt is made to calculate the immensity of
its duration —the constant evolving from the Great Centre, of light
still more perfected, produced innumerable millions of suns, which
occupied another orbit or circle in relation to the Great Parent of
their formation! After a corresponding organization of parts, these,
by attraction, condensation, repulsion, and the evolution of their own
atmospheres, produced planets and satellites, in a manner corresponding to the infinite formations of the first Circle.
The extreme heat, the intensity of which transcends the utmost
conception of thought, and is as many million degrees greater thart
the hottest artificial fire, as the latter is degrees above the warmth of
the human system,-this heat constantly evolving light so intense,
that its strength would have repulsed planets supposed to be near its
source (if such were possible) from their orbits,-formed, by such
radiation, another Circle of Suns. And each constantly develops
its laws, forces, and motions, expands in power and contracts in volume, according to the law of equal magnitudes. And each of these
suns possesses matter still more refined and unparticled than those of
the former system, and their planets were formed out of matter still
more refined as evolved from their own centres.  And so there was
an endless circle of suns and formations produced as corresponding
to other circles, each circle being a System of eternal systems, and an
index and symbol of the Great Sun or Focus of undefinable magnitude from which all emanated!
A fourth Circle of Suns was correspondingly formed, with accompaniments similar to those produced by the former.
Afojih Circle of Suns was also evolved in the order of progressive.

as was the case with the former, passed to the circumference of its
influence, the matter of which formed constellations, planets, and satellites, each observing the same laws as were first established, cac(ki

revolving on its axis, and also observing nearly the same plane in its
revolutions around the Centre or Sun which produced them. Ano
thus was formed afiftih Circle of Suns and systems of worlds.
A sixth Circle of formations was also produced: and these are Suns
only.  As they have not yet become properly consolidated, their atmosphere has not yet produced other formations; and so they are at
this time pursuing their undefinable orbits in the form  and composition of blazitng Comcts.*
The time that has elapsed in years, from  the Beginning until the
completion of the six circles of suns, could not be represented to the
human mind, if every particle that composes this globe should pass
* On a subject so immense, human ideas, especially in this sphere of being, must
uJf necessity be of a very general and indefinite character; and any illustrations offered
must appear exceedingly diminutive and unworthy of the subject. But on the principle that one atom represents the whole Universe, let the reader suppose that the comparative atom, which is all the most powerful imagination can conceive of in attempting
to form an idea of the Great Sun of the Univerccelum, is stationary in the centre of
infinite space. Ilaming with the most inconceivable heat, its vaporized materials
extended from the nucleus far beyond the utmost bounds of the human imagination.
By virtue of a chemical association of particles of like affinity, or gravitation (which
the author explains as synonymous), this igneous atmosphere of the great Body, in
process of time unimaginable, gradually divided itself into six concentric rings, the only
analogue of which we have in the now condensed rings of Saturn. So long as the
great Nucleus remained stationary, it would be the common focal point of all the concentric rings, being equi-distant from all parts of their respective circumferences. But'a rapid motion of the great Body (which the author says it possessed from the beginning) would produce an elongation of these rings somewhat analogous to the trail of a
comet, —leaving the great mass of materials in its rear. Supposing the motion to be
in an elliptic orbit, the sudden recurve and centrifugal impetus of the projecting trail,
occurring at every passage of the great Body around the foci of the ellipse, would
finally (when condensation became sufficiently advanced) produce a detachment of
the great vapory trail, which would subsequently assume a spheroid form and become
a Sun corresponding to its origin. In this way the six " nebulous zones" formed a
corresponding number of central suns, and from which have emanated a corresponding number of Universes! These the author calls " circles of suns,"- that is, circular
planes of suns, —and are all, with their countless millions of appendages, silently describing their infinite orbits around the great Centre of all centres!
Our sun and system, and all the innumerable stars which the telescope can reveal,
tihe author informs us, belong to the fifth great Circle or plane of formations.
The author requests me to say that, as this work is merely intended to establish,general principles, this great subject is here treated with brevity, and more particular
descriptions, and especially calculations as to distances and magnitudes, will be given
in a future work.
The nebular theory of creation, as presented on this magnificent scale, does not do
pend upon any present nebular appearances in the heavens, as the author distinctly
says, that with an instrument sufficiently powerful, these all might be resolved'into stars.

separately before the human vision, and millions of years were to
elapse between the passage of each particle! If this duration could
oe conceived of, the mind would still be incompetent to comprehend
the time which elapsed from the Beginning to the sixth formation!
The Great CENTRE from which all of these systems and Systems
of systems emanated, is still an exhaustless Fountain of never-ending
materials! It is a magnificent and glorious Sun- a Centre around
which all suns and Suns of suns revolve. It is a Vortex, breathing
forth a system of concentric circles of suns and systems of suns.  It
is an everlasting and unchangeable Parent of all things! It is still
an Ocean of undulated and undefinable fire, the holy emblem of Perfection.  With an everlasting spontaneousness, it breathes forth unnumbered worlds, and a corresponding infinite expansion of co-eternal and immutable Power.  It displays, throughout the immensity
of space, correspondences of its own inherent nature.  It is a Germ,
in which nothing exists but what is everlasting and infinite; and
it develops these inexpressible attributes in the successive degrees
and orders of formation, throughout the vast Univerccelum and the
boundless duration of Eternity!
~ 4. The magnificent nebulous Zone, which was formed in time
unimaginable by the incessant emanation of light and heat from the
Great Eternal Sun, not only approximated nearly to its Productor,
but expanded through the regions of infinite space even far beyond
the sixth circle of suns.
The great mass of Matter or Fire contained heat, the latter being
a production of the former.  The heat contained light, which it in
order spread throughout the expanse of infinity.  And this light was
the peculiar composition adapted to, and assigned for, the production
of an infinity of worlds and systems of worlds, in orders and degrees
of development, and in forms like unto the first Great Form. Thus
light is a perfection and development of the original composition.
And light thus formed the nebulous Ring or Circle, surrounding
undefinable space!
Positive and Negative constantly acting on, and producing eternal
motion throughout the mass of nebulous associated particles, the Positive, or Attraction, called to a great centre, particles of like affinity
and suitable to enter into combination. The Negative force, or the
repulsion, threw off from the great body particles not suitable to its

interior combinations.  Thus were formed, at equal periods, the suns
of tile First Circle.
These suns (especially the centres of them), were still fire inconceivable; and these also gave off an emanation of heat and light.
This light, or the particles composing it, in the same manner
as the suns themselves were formed, produced planets and satellites. The suns being too light and unparticled, could not consolidate in a manner similar to the condensation of their light in
other centres or worlds. But the light thrown from them was capable of becoming less rare than their own composition; and therefore
the constant absorption of the rays of light produced in each of their
planets a hardened or consolidated combination of particles.
The number of planets and other formations emanating from these
suns, is as incalculable as the number of suns produced from the
Eternal Sun. Each of these suns has its own established planetary
system, each planet in which, in order, observing the same plane,
and taking the same direction, moves around the sun or centre which
formed it: and the whole move around the Eternal Centre or Germ
of their existence!
These planets can not properly be termed such: for their compositions are too rare to form mineral substances.  They are rather an
adhesion of particles caused by the law of condensation and mutual
attraction, or gravitation.  But still they are bodies of an almost
wholly fiery interior constitution.  So they are in reality what would
be termed cometary bodies; each of which pursues the orbit of its
first formation, according to the bulk and density of its peculiar elements. Such is the condition of the first infinite Circle of suns, and
of the worlds by them produced.
A still greater accumulation of particles sent off from the Great
Sun, produced another circle, like unto the first,-with a corresponding number of planets and satellites.  The suns in this circle
being still more rare than those in the first, have less fire, but contain more heat; and they are capable of expanding, and sending
forth more unparticled light relatively than the former.  The same
laws still work their mighty influence throughout the circle formed
by these suns: and by constant emanation of nebulous matter, planets are, at irregular distances, in constant process of formation.  By
the attraction of these suns, all particles negative to their own coinposition, gravitated to them again: and others by virtue of inherent
motion and refinement, were repulsed or, thrown off with a velocity

inconceivable, seeking substances of like affinity among other forma
tions in the system which the sun had thus yielded forth. The condensation of materials into planets belonging to this system, was produced by a constant attraction or absorption of light, the rare particles composing them gravitating to, or being attracted by, the sun.
And these may be properly styled planets; for they gradually condensed into particles of earthy composition.  The one closest to the
sun is harder than the second; and the third is still more dense than,he latter; and denser and rarer alternately and correspondingly succeed
each other, throughout the worlds composing one of these systems.
The condensed particles, and the progression of the same forming
the substance that is termed earth, are totally unlike any compositions of a terrestrial nature that are known to be in existence by the
human mind.
It is impossible to calculate the immensity of their circumferences
or diameters; for they are infinitely larger than several millions of
the stuns belonging to the fifth Circle. And the suitns of the second
Circle transcend the utmost powers of the conception or imagination. And the suns of the first Circle, and their planets, are still
more inconceivable-are utterly beyond conception, even as is the
unimaginable and unchangeable Sun that gave them an existence.

heat and more light than the former, and are nearer the state of condensation.  Still they are not condensed; for they contain heat inconceivable. Their light, associating with atoms of like nature, has
become suitable to produce still denser bodies than are produced by
the light of those of the former circle; and so these suns were destined to produce planets of a still more condensed and consolidated
constitution.  The constant interchanging of particles; the throwing
off of the non-associating atoms, and the receiving of others of like
affinity, gradually produced a system of planets and satellites, corresponding to other creations of like nature.
The particles which have progressed to the terra-material formation oi these planets, are still of such a peculiar and refined nature
that no substance known on earth bears a resemblance to them.
The first has, in process of condensation, assumed a hardened surface having two strata, the first of which is an imaginable formation
of particles of sand, somewhat in appearance like the carbonate of
lime mixed with coral substances, yet not in any particular contain

134            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.'ng the qualities or essences of either. It is more refined than is
possible to conceive of from a comparison with any substance known
on earth.
Such is the composition and constitution of the first and second
planets of the third circle of suns.  And the appearance of the same
is gradually diminished with their increasing distances; and many
of the planets that they sustain have none of the above compositions
yet developed.
The suns of thefo?lurth Circle contain still less heat and light than
those of the former; but still the intensity of each is incomprehensible to the mind.  They send off light still more unparticled, insomuch that they become active agents of light.  After an inconceivable period of time, and an incessant emanation of this unparticled
matter from the suns which this composed, this produced corresponding systems of planetary worlds, diminishing in number and
magnitude, yet too mighty in expanse to be calculated or comprehended.  By virtue of the motion going on throughout this great
system of systems, and by the laws of condensation, absorption, gravitation, repulsion and association of atoms, the planets formed became
still more dense in constitution than those before described.
Planets that are nearest these suns have progressed to earthy forrations and developments; while those that are further, are still more
refined and less dense in particles that compose earthy substance.
Those that are progressed have three formations; the last of which
nearly resembles the present appearance of this globe; but is not of
the same constitution or quality. Their materials are more refined
and perfect, not in quality, but in particles.
So likewise afifth Circle of suns was brought into existence, corresponding to the other creations. These are composed of less heat
and light relatively than the former: still their heat and light are
immense. And particles evolved from these suns were still more
refined and ethereal.  But by virtue of eternal laws inherent and
immutable in this composition, it gradually and correspondingly
brought into existence an immense number of planets and satellites,
the magnitude of which is not yet fully determined or comprehended.
By the operation of these laws, and after an inconceivable period of
time, the planets were created which belong to our own solar system.
Planets that are nearer to these suns are correspondingly denser than
those further from them.
rThe distance that the lilght of the suns of the fifth circle passes off

into space, is too vast for ordinary conception, still is limited corn
pared to the extension of the light of suns of the previous circles.
The condensation of particles from the sun of our own solar system (which stands as a general representative of all others in this
Circle) has produced various strata of earthy formations.  The first
planet is extremely dense, and its surface is composed of a mineral
and rocky substance. It has combinations similar to those upon this
globe, but which are more refined in applearcncc, though not in
qualiy.  This one has been named MERCURY.
The next has formations four in number, the last of which has not
yet been fully developed: and it is less in density of composition
than the former.  This is named VENUS.
The third has combinations of earthy substances still less dense
than the former.  The number of formations and strata developed is
ficc, the last being nearly consummated.  The composition of the
first partakes of silica, lime, and other mineral developments.  And
the formations successively produced in the order of development,
consist of various species of earth and stone, until the fourth, and
now nearly the fifth, is produced.  The last of these composes the
crust, or the fifth geological development of the planet termed
EARTH.
The next one in order has corresponding formations. It is not
any larger, but is less dense than the latter.  It is termed MAzrs.
The one succeeding this has still a greater number of formations,
which are still more refined, in quality and constitution.  This is
termed JUPITEn.
The next has formations unequalled by those of any planet existing between it and the sun to which it belongs.  Its composition is
still less dense and less gross than the latter.  The earth that its formations have developed, is pure, fertile, and inconceivably refined.
And like the Great Sun whence it came, but to which it is as the
least particle that composes the eye of the smallest insect is to it, it
has formed a nebulous zone, and that another, — each of which surrounds it still, unbroken and but slightly condensed; but which will
ultimately compose other nebulous masses, the whole of which will
form a globe which will assume a track according to its own specific
gravity, as have and do all others.  This planet is termed SATURN-.
The planets receding still further from this, grow less dense and
more refined than those preceding.  Some of them  pursue their
orbits uncondensed and unstratified.  Their orbits are immense, but

t36 4NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
are in proportion to the refinement of their constituents, as not being
suitable to associate with any composition of the sun which produced
them.  From  this cause they are repulsed to the extreme distance
that the nature of their compositions can allow them to occupy.
And these are COMrETs-each of which will assume the constitution
of a planet of like nature with all others in the same circle of
formation.
A sixtfh Circle of suns was in order produced; and these contain
no fire, less light, and more electricity.  And having not yet become
suns properly, by reason of their inherent qualities and compositions,
they are at this time traversing almost the bounds of undefinable
apace.  The orbit of their revolution surrounds space incalculable.
~ 6. Thus the Univerccelum is a boundless accumulation of particles that have assumed by virtue of inherent qualities, forms, orders,
degrees, associations, and correspondences.  Every particle, from
the first to the last circle, gravitated to the centre destined for its
association.  Thus were established forms; and perpetual forms produced Order.  And by the association of each particle throughout
the vast Univercoelum, with particles of like affinity, from the lowest
to the highest, Degrercs were established throughout every departtnent of Creation.  And there was a constant gravitation of particles
going on throughout the whole Mass of material compositions.  And
thus in order was produced this vast and universal extension of
worlds and systems of worlds, throughout immensity of space.
Development of inherent qualities to an external manifestation of
the same, and progression of all things to ultimate refinement and
purification, were only in order with corresponding developments of
higher spheres and more eternal assemblages.  And each particle
was destined ultimately to ascend to that degree of refinement; and
each sphere successively and incessantly put forth its ultimate particles to produce, sustain, and associate, with others of like affinity and
nature, that were thrown off from the Mass as too pure and unparticled to associate with that of a grosser and denser quality.
Therefore the Great Sun-the unimaginable Ocean of liquid material-was a Centre from which (according to the development of
its atmosphere, which extended throughout immensity) rolled forth a
circle of suns to the extreme extent of particles associating to produce
them.
Thus also Order and Form were developed.  For their distance

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                137
from the Great Sun their Parent, was in proportion to the density of
their composition; and their distances from each other were correspondingly sustained by the same influence of eternal gravitation.
And all worlds emanating from these, were but blazing and productive
suns to other planets. And corresponding ultimate associations and
formations have progressed, until the extreme of their emanation has
resulted in the formation of the sixth Circle.
And so the suns of the first Circle are an ultimate of the Great
Sun; and those of the second Circle may be called an ultimate of the
first. They are no more than accumulations of particles, and thus
are planets. And the third Circle of Suns arp an ultimate of the second; and the fourth, of the third; and the fifth, of the fourth; and
the sixth, of the fifth.  Thus there is no disconnexion; but there is
a perfect harmony and unity in all celestial and terra-material productions: and so each may be considered as a part necessary to the
completion of the whole Univerccelum of boundless infinitude!
Time and space, height and depth, length and breadth, are annihilated in this vast system of concentric and celestial circles-a perfection and perpetual development of the Great FOUNTAIN from which
they all successively emanated.  An attempt to calculate the immense
magnitude of one of these systems, would be useless; for they transcend the utmost conceptions and calculations of the human mind.
One of the suns of the second Circle is several millions of trillions
times larger than the sun of our solar system, which is in the fifth
Circle! No combinations of numbers is adequate to express the
diametrical magnitude of those of the second Circle; and millions of
times more incalculable are those of the first!  And the Great Sun
or Fountain, from which all of these sprang, is too infinite in its magnitude to be. in any way meditated upon consistently; and so a definite conception can not be had of the GERM that has produced an
infinitude of inconceivable worlds!
And the time which has elapsed during these formations is equally
incalculable; for it is beyond the powers of the most vigorous and
brilliant imagination to even pass one thought upon the time that
elapsed between the first assumption of form by particles thrown from
the Great Mass, to that form's ultimate production. -And yet following this were suns and systems of suns, and constellations and planets,
without number, and new forms constantly displaying themselves,
until millions and millions of millions of worlds-an iinity of worlds
-were traversing the boundless fields of immensity, displaying the

1.38           NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
most perfect order, arrangement, and organization. These constantly
put forth new particles, an evidence and index of new and youthful
productions, which were constantly succeeding. And so we may trace
correspondingly another almost infinity of formations and consequent
re-formations, until all arrive at their present state of order, and their
present refinement of ultimate particles,-having condensed and consolidated by a gradual association of inherent particles, both gross
and refined, each of which gravitates to its like, and possesses motion
in proportion to the specific density or rarity of the substances with
which it is in combination.
And thus, from the first to the last, has elapsed an inconceivable
period of time, and as immense a production of new forms, in orders,
degrees, and associations, throughout the whole vast immensity which
they fill! And yet creation (or its ultimate) extends infinitely beyond
the sixth Formation! For there is from the Great Fountain, Germ,
or Parent of these worlds, an everlasting combination of materials,
which when once developed would extend into infinite space, and
light tip every chamber throughout the vast Univerccelum with a light
inaccessible and inconceivable, constantly bringing into existence fiew
forms as results of the inherent qualities and combinations composing
the GREAT ETERNAL SUN! And the emanations, after establishing
the sixth Circle of formations, both breathe from, and cause to converge to it (according to internal and immutable laws that were established in the beginning), elements which, by constant flux and reflux,
are engaged in producing a Universe of pre-eminent grandeur and
infinitude!
Creation, then, has just commenced! For it is, as it everlastingly
has been, putting forth new forms and manifesting unchangeable energies-the very essence of all power-the uncontrollable fiat of the
Great Positive Mind!
The Great Sun, thus pregnated with the immutable, eternal Essence
of divine Positive Power, and being itself as immutable and eternal,
containing particles destined to become infinitely sublimated, will still
produce the most magnificent and excellent forms, displaying infinite
beauty, refinement, and perfection, throughout the undefinable periods
of this Eternity, which opens and unfolds a new-an eternity of eternities, and throughout space not yet conceived of, nor yet filled with
the perfection with which it is destined to abound!
It is the nature of all things (and this is derived from the Great
Origin) to assume forms and characteristics corresponding with the





## p. 139 (#167) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                139
interior qualities contained in the particles. And the/forms assumed
observe perpetual Order, and develop degrees, these all corresponding to inherent and invisible qualities which constitute their cause and
actuator.  Therefore, from the inherent, interior elements, essences,
and attributes of the Great Fountain of all fountains, corresponding
worlds and systems of worlds, too vast to be adequately comprehended, have been produced.
~ 7. If every second of animal life that ever has elapsed upon
this globe, from the first sentient production unto the present moment,
could be comprehended, still all would be but one second in comparison to the time that elapsed between the first assumption of form by
particles, and the breathing forth and establishment of the last system
of suns. For there have not seconds yet gone by since this globe
and all things on it have had an existence, to compare with, or adequately to express, the number of years, or even centuries, occupied
in the formation of one of the systems contemplated.  And yet creation, or the existence and production of worlds, has been but one momcnet in progress as compared to the duration of the formations that
are to go on throughout time and space unimaginable  
Then all these systems, with all their emanations and appendages,
arising from, and yet progressing to, the Vortex of Positive Power,
may be justly considered as oNE SYSTEM! It is here subdivided,
in order to facilitate a general conception of the whole Structure by
enabling the mind to associate the various orders and degrees of development which it is more capable of comprehending. Yet it is but
one general Evolution of worlds from the Great Centre, and therefore is but one infinite Production from one eternal Origin!  And
only one single moment has elapsed, comparatively, since the first
formed of these vast and universal systems has had an existence!
But one single moment have they been in process of development from
the Great Source, and in passing through all the various changes and
conditions which the particles of each have assumed, in form, order,
specific gravities, geological developments, undefinable and unimaginable revolutions, and reciprocal and incessant interchanging and circulation of parts and particles!
The vast Ocean of materials in ceaseless motion and activity, from
whose bosom these systems were developed and born into existence,
and each inconceivably extended system and System of systems involved together, with all their accompanying excellences and beau,

140            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
ties, are everlasting indices of future, inevitable, and corresponding
emanations from the great exhaustless Fountain from which these all
have successively flown. All these productions and reproductions
-all these suns and systems of suns, with all their accompanying
worlds — are but as one 1article, are but one breathing forth of internal qualities from the great eternal Fount, in comparison to the
grand and glorious developments that are to be produced and extended throughout the height, and depth, and length, and breadth, of
the whole vast Univerccelum!
Thus but one atom has been developed in comparison to that which
shall be developed; and but one second has elapsed in comparison to
the corresponding extension of time!
Thus the thought finds no resting-place. It feels the material
form, and is conscious of its habitation.  It meditates definitely only
upon objects that are suitable for its comprehension and association.
Anything beyond such objects is but a vacuum in which imagination,
whose flight is swifter than the sunbeam, seeks for a resting-place.
It searches throughout the chambers of the heaven of heavens, and
roams through the labyrinths that are continually opening into new
fields of celestial beauty which utterly transcend all minds but that
MIND which produced them.  It returns from its flight in the infinitude of space, and inquires with breathless and inexpressible amazemlent, When was the beginning, and when shall be the end, of eternal
time and unbounded creations?
Thus the human mind can not conceive of eternity or infinity; for
it is limited in its nature, belonging to, and produced by, finite forms,
and existing among transient things.  Consequently its thoughts must
have bounds; and subjects must be limited, or it can not comprehend
them.  Creations must not be of indefinite extent, or of materials
without sensible parallel, or else the mind can not conceive of their
magnitude, or their elements and properties.  Limits are therefore
necessary, in order that the mind may conceive correctly of internal
realities and external forms and substances.  For if the boundless
infinitude is presented to the mind, with it a condition of indefinite
thought presents itself likewise. Its capacities are finite, and its conceptions are of like nature. No matter how exalted it may be, it
must conceive of bounds, or else there is no conception.
But in its sparkling brilliancy, the imagination will pass off into infinite space; and not being able to perceive limits, it becomes confused and bewildered. And hence the question above referred to





## p. 141 (#169) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.              141
has been asked with as little meaning as the mind has had conception
of infinite space.
No human power or invention is capable of representing any correct idea of the immensity of systems which extend and expand
throughout unmeasured space. No mathematical calculation can be
made respecting them; for numbers are lost in worlds whose numbers transcend the conceptions of the human mind. Figures may be
combined to such an extent as to transcend all powers of comprehension; yet the mere comprehension of these would give but a limited
understanding of this immensity. No matter how extensive and how
powerful the figure may be to represent time and space, it has limits;
and is therefore no comparison.
The mind may contemplate the many formations in the sidereal
heavens; it may contemplate their circumferences, their diameters,
their immense revolutions; it may ponder and meditate upon the
compositions and combinations that are existing in each formation;
it may endeavor to conceive of the various geological formations of
each as they were successively developed from the first condensation
of particles into worlds, to the extended and almost infinite expanse
of systems to the sixth formation of suns,-and even if it could succeed in grasping all these, its conceptions would be limited, —and
therefore would give not the least possible idea of iTifinite space!
The mind may be mighty enough to comprehend one system and
its compositions, forms, movements, and all the objects and forms,
both perfect and imperfect, that are existing upon its surfaces; it may
be sufficiently expansive to comprehend the interior, the invisible,
realities and external appearances of all things thereon existing; it
may be penetrating enough to understand the motive power, and
energy of all action, motion, and sensation, that each of these forms
develops;-and these would be mighty conceptions-would constitute the full range of human thought! But still, how comparatively
limited and contracted are these conceptions! -for they in reality do
not constitute one particle in comparison to one half of the first formation of suns!
8S. Therefore the human mind is absolutely incompetent to conceive of infinity; and to the mind, this word vibrates and echoes no
corresponding thought. The word infinity, as applied to indefinite
space, is one substituted in place of an idea. And there never was
and never can be an adequate conception of Eternity; for the thought

t42            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of this is of itself a non-entity, and the word expresses no signification.
But as the human mind is a composition of the refined and perfected materials of all else existing, it refuses to associate with things
of a lower order and less degree of refinement; but has a tendency
to pass off to explore and associate with something of a like lofty
nature.  Hence it seeks not to analyze and comprehend things in
the lower degrees of existence, but it aspires to higher and more exalted spheres. Mind is then only seeking its equilibrium. It is
gravitating toward the sphere that is attractive to it. It is endeavoring to pass from its present nidulated state, to some unknown, yet
attractive, habitation among the avenues and chambers of the spiritual
and celestial forms.
Such is mind! and such are its inclinations. The amount of
thought that has been excited in reference to the subject under contemplation, is incalculable; yet if all the thoughts that ever have
existed, since the formation and existence of this globe up to the
present moment, were combined, they would not give the mind a
proper conception of the number of years, or even centuries, that this
globe itself was assuming the form which it now possesses!
As it was in the beginning, so the vast and boundless Univerccelum,
the Great Sun and Centre from which all these worlds and systems
of worlds emanated, is still an exhaustless Fountain of chaotic materials, and living, inherent energy to drive into existence billions and
millions of billions of suns, with all their appendages, more than have
yet been produced!  For it has eternal Motion, and contains the
forms that all things subsequently assume; and it contains laws that
are displayed in the geometrical and mechanical structure, combinations, and movements, of the vast systems that are brought forth.
And from this great living Vortex roll forth the unimaginable elements.
properties, combinations, laws, forces, forms, and motions, that have
produced, and will still produce, an infinitude of systems and Systems
of systems, whose concentric circles are but an expanse from the
Great Germ of all existence, and are incessantly acting and reacting,
changing, harmonizing, organizing, and etherealizing, every particle
of chaotic and undeveloped matter that exists in the Vortex!
Yet in the beginning, such was the condition of the materials of all
worlds that now have an existence. And there are now existing six
circles of blazing suns, —each of which has assemblages so vast and
extensive that they can not be conceived of by the human mind!





## p. 143 (#171) ############################################


NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               143
And the various productions that have resulted from these organized
bodies, and the peculiar combinations that they contain, are equally
incomprehensible.  Still, in the very contemplation of this inconceivable creation of undefinable systems, the mind is led still onward
to inquire for the E3nd!  But why interrogate concerning that which
can not be conceived of? And why endeavor to comprehend the
space and time that infinitude is composed of? Yet the mind goes
onward and upward to higher states and further researches into the
undefinable regions of eternity.
So then all these systems that have been produced, and are existinog, are in reality but one single atom, and occupying but one inc/h,
in comparison to that which is to be. And so time and space are
virtually annihilated; and Power and Materials are adequate to fill
the extreme bounds of their indivisible, undistinguishable infinitude!
All of the mighty systems that were evolved from the great Centre.
observed, according to the density or rarity of each respectively, a
rotary and orbicular motion around the Centre from which they emanated.  The very moment that an association of particles was established, action and reaction, condensation, and an orbicular and rotary
motion, were produced. And in accordance with the density or
rarity of the planet, was the distance intervening between it and the
sun around which it revolved.  There was no disconnected force or
impetus applied to the bodies thus formed, to set them in harmonious
motion; no foreign power impulsed and guided them in order in
their respective planes of revolution; but inhercnt laws, capable of
controlling these manifestations, were developed and brought into
action, according to the development of the forms to be thus acted
upon.
And so the great worlds that are distributed throughout the immensity of space, are incessantly reciprocating particles and substances
with each other. And in accordance with their density or rarity,
with their lower or higher degrees of development, with their gross
or refined conditions, are their distances determined, and their,notions established.
And the great eternal elements that were successively developed
and evolved from the Great Centre that contained them, were Heat,
Light, and Electricity. Heat was an emanation from fire; and the
light produced from heat by its becoming less particled and more
rare and active, was so much sublimated and refined, that its ultimate

144            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
was (and is) that all-pervading element throughout the Universe,
Electricity.
Electricity could not have existed in its present condition primitively; for there were no means and no substances qualified to develop
it.  But as the First existed alone, its constant progression until
Electricity was produced as an ultimate, shows that the latter was a
perfection of that which was eternally existing. Thus the lower
contained and developed the highest, while the highest acts on, and
pervades, all below its exalted state of perfection. Hence, electricity pervades all bodies, all substance, all elements, and passes unrestrictedly through every avenue and pore that exists in every particle
throughout the Universe.  It is the elastic substance that exists
within and surrounds all things, and is the powerful agent of motion,
life, and activity. It is constantly and incessantly engaged in rarifying and purifying all things; and is a medium to transmit power and
matter in particles, from  one substance to another, and from  one
planet to another, and from each planet to the sun.
There is not existing a quantity of electricity in the sun amounting
to a positive or attractive power.  Nor. is there such a thing existing
as positive repulsion, as produced by any elements or principles of
like nature: and motion is neither produced nor sustained by any
such actuating principles.  Nor is anything formed, or organized, or
existing, as an effect, produced by plositive opposites. For if a substance could be produced in this way, it would be existing in a
vacuum, and between two antagonistic principles; and hence it could
experience no motion, no action, no exchanging of particles, no
increase nor diminution.  It would be an immovable and unchangeable object, destitute of all life and usefulness.  But instead
of opposites existing, there is a harmony in all the formations, and a
positive and absolute necessity of each production, according to the
forces and elements existing in the Vortex of Positive Power, and
the Fount of chaotic materials. For both are immutable and eternal
in their adaptations, the one to form, and the other to constitute the
materials for the formations. And thus the systems of suns and
planets, with all their appendages, and all the vast assemblages of
worlds throughout the sidereal regions, were brought into existence by
the united and harmonious action of fixed and established principles.
Then what is meant by attraction, gravitation, and condensation, is
an association of particles possessing mutual affinities.  And as there
is constantly a refinement of inherent particles in all bodies, so there





## p. 145 (#173) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                146
is a constant passing off from the same of those particles which
have become too refined to continue an association with the same
composition.
And the constant attraction existing between all bodies in the vast
system of the planetary worlds, is owing to a mutual gravitation
from each of particles that have become fitted to associate with
each other's composition. And thus worlds and Worlds of worlds
were made; and thus are they sustained. And thus is universal
motion, from the angular to the spiral, developed. And thus does,
and shall, the great Eternal Laboratory unceasingly produce and
reproduce, until all things and all substances shall become rarified,
refined, and perfected, and until all will gravitate to spheres of celestial attraction and spiritual association.
~ 9. The great system of planetary formations, and the inherent
laws by which they were produced in order, harmony, and progressive development, are now presented to the mind. In this manner
were these developed from primeval matter, which was fire, this
being acted upon by the Great Positive Power, the Vortex of which
contained this as the only substance.  And all material substances
and compositions were an emanation or a progressive sphere or (Iatnosp.lere, proceeding from the great internal Actuator.  And a progression (such as has been described) to the organization and estab:lishment of systems of worlds, and a constant operation of all laws
inherently contained in the Great Mass, have produced all things that
are now in being.  And thus is the immensity of space peopled withl
worlds, and planets, and their appendages, and still finer and more
remote assemblages, which are beyond the power of human vision!
The pla.n of the great System, thus presented, gives order to the
thoughts, and assists the mind in its endeavors to comprehend its
vastness.  This extensive generalization is the only means by whichl
the human mind can conceive of the countless worlds that are below,,.
above, and around its own existence.
The peculiar elements and combinations existing in other worlds,.
are greatly dissimilar to any substance that is existing in this material
sphere.  If a particular and detailed description of. these innumer —
able worlds were given, it would be beyond the comprehension of
the mind, and also beyond its power of forming conceptions ifrom~
analogy.  If the geological formations of' these worlds were considered, from the primary condensation of particleslto tle-lowest pointl:

of gravitation; and if the various divisions of that which is, and of
that which is not stratified, were presented; and if their present external appearances were also given, together with their diameters and
circumferences,-it would be revealing that which the mind could
neither comprehend nor associate with by any process of analogical
reasoning, or any power of expansive thought. If I were to speak
of the minerals, or particles that had become the constituents of such
bodies; and if the epoch was described when these were produced,
together with the peculiar animals and species of plants, this would
likewise be unnecessary and useless. If all the animated, organized
beings that are existing upon these innumerable worlds were described; and if an anatomical and physiological description and
delineation of their peculiar structures were given, and the degrees
of perfection that they occupy in the scale of universal progression
relative to others in existence, were spoken of; and if the degrees
and orders of their mental associations were likewise represented, —
it would be only indulging the desire and love for the marvellous,
creating wonder and astonishment, but presenting nothing that would
be of real application or usefulness, even if it were susceptible of
comprehension. For, if it is impossible for the human mind to
conceive of the vastness of this infinity of worlds, is it not also
impossible for it to conceive of any of the specific or detailed compositions or bodies that are existing upon their external surfaces?
But a true conception of the Univercoelum, and of its harmonious
formations, would lead the human mind to conceive of systems correslponding to each other, and to make useful and extensive generalizations, — the result of which would be to cause man to carry out
more harmoniously, in his own l;fc, the teachings of the beauties that
exist in the Universe, and to apply them  properly to his own happiness and usefulness.
The Great Sun of all suns emanated the three principles and elements that are mediums and connecting links of universal motion and
activity. The Fountain from which they all sprang into existence,
was an emanation from the Interior, and from qualities and essences:therein existing.  And so the great Body was an atmosphere or halo
surrounding the great Centre or Sun internally existing.  And
Heat, Light, and Electricity, were successive developments of this
great Mass. Each being properly developed, the last became an
active agent, a Ngativec to the internal, Positive Power.  And Matger, existing in its unparticled state, was the vehicle and substance

through and on which the two great Powers could act to produce all
that has been rolled forth into the immensity of space.
Electricity therefore pervades the infinity of space.  It penetrates
all substances, and exists in and throughout all worlds, with all their
component parts.  It exists in everything and everywhere; and there
is not one particle in the realms of infinite space that has not within
its composition the unparticled and active agent of Electricity.
Being the ultimate, or the progressed and perfected essense of the
Great Eternal Sun, it pervades all things below its pre-eminent state
of perfection,-and thus is a Negoative to the Internal and still more
perfected —the perfection of inconceivable purity —the Great Positive Mind!
These  are the only  Principles and Elements in existence:
and all other things are mere modfilcations of these Principles.
This emanation from  the Great Body may be termed an atinosphere, a halo, or nebulous zone, that surrounded the immensity of
space with brightness and beauty inconceivable. And thus was originally established the eternal Truth and real reality, that everyt~hing,,
has its own peculiar atmosphere, and consequently its specific and
necessary association.  For every world that has been spontaneously
breathed forth from the Great Centre, by virtue of its eternal motion
and activity, has an atmoslhere or circle, extending to the extreme
point of its repelling influence.  And all planets and satellites have
their respective atmospheres, not only as emanating from their surfaces like all others, but as divided into strata of formations, the
character and extent of which are determined by the density and circumference of the respective bodies to which they belong.
An atmosphere is a progression, or an ascension from the denser
mass of particles, seeking association with that of like nature; and it
consists of substances which have become too refined and unparticled to continue to exist in that of a dense or gross quality and coinplosition. The stratified atmosphere that is formed around every
body, substance, and globe, in existence, is an emanation from the
body, and a perfection of the particles composing it.  There is therefore an atmosphere belonging to every particle in being, the composition of which is finer than that from which it emanated. And according to the quality of such emanation, is established its relative
distance, and the character of the association which it seeks.  Then
from the Great Centre there is'an infinite expansion of suns and
worlds of suns, which have become organized and condensed, and

act and react upon each other; and their incessant motion has produced each planetary formation in order and degrees of development
and association of particles, and each of these was a progression of
that from which it came, until an infinity of systems have been
brought into being. By the virtue of inherent qualities, and the
incessant action of immutable laws, the sixth circle has become
established,-the suns of which are not yet fully condensed and
organized into systems like others, but are still in a condition like
unto the cometic nuclei. And all these infinite creations were produced by an expansion of the inherent Principles contained in the
original composition, and a natural and consequent assuming of the
forms which characterize each development!
~ 10. There is to the observer an apparent cofusion existing among
the innumerable visible bodies that inhabit the ocean of space. They
do not appear in perfect order. They do not assume forms and become condensed before the human eye: and there is an a)p)carance
of irregularity throughout the sidereal heavens.  But these external
appearances are deceptive; for the whole structure of the Universe
is but a composition of particles, sustaining relative points and locations given them by their own natural compositions and associations.
And all are but parts composing the great Whole, the whole being
but one particle in comparison to the systems that are existing, and
to the new ones that are putting forth as new particles, in the further
extremes of infinite space! And all are existing in beauty, order,
and harmony, and are approximating to perfection. There is no interference with each other, no interruption of each other's movements;
but all move onward with inconceivable rapidity, yet in the most calm
and peaceful manner that can be imagined.  They not only answer
the purpose for which they have assumed their present condition, but
are almost intellectually reciprocating particles and essences with each
other, and disseminating freely heat, light, and electricity,- which
give new and living energies to particles and substances with which
they come in contact.
And thus, by the ever-controlling influence, and the inconceivably
active energies of the Positive, Divine Mind, are all these effects
brought into being. And by immutable and eternal laws originally
established, it will continue to reproduce and recreate new worlds
of supreme excellences and exalted states of material perfection, until
every particle that composes every sun and every system of suns and

World of worlds, extending infinitely beyond the power of human
thought, and infinitely beyond all that has been yet produced and organized-until these, and all their particles, become the very essence
of vegetable and animal existence!  And the latter, with the active
energies inherently accompanying it, not only will pass to the perfection of spiritual essence, but will work its mighty influence upon
everything below it, until all things arrive at an exalted state of
spiritual and celestial perfection!
Thus all matter will pass through the multifarious forms and stages
that are existing, and all will ultimately be resolved into the unlmarticled state, and will ascend to associate with higher and more glorious
spheres-of spiritual composition.  Then the Great Positive Mind,
around whose Centre exists this exhaustless fountain of materials,
will be Positive to the great Negative formed by the perfection of
all things else in being.  And then Deity and Spirit will be existing only!
In association are Positive and Negative.  In quality, the last of
all things, or spiritual principle, will be like thefirst of all things, or
the Great Positive Mind: only there can not be an association; for
the first is a mighty, inconceivable Whole, the Essence of Intelligence; while the second, or last of all things, will be a Negative in
the great Sphere or Vortex of the Divine Mind. The same will be
most eminently perfect, because it will have arrived at the degree of
refinement which the inherent and immutable laws of progression
tend ultimately to produce in all things.  In knowledge it will be
negative; but in affection it will be as pure and inseparable as the
System of worlds that are swimming in the realms of space.
Therefore the spiritual Princip7le, or the destined Ultimate of all
things in existence, vill be a Neativec to the Great Positive Mind;
and between the two will emanate cew worlds-an epoch of another
BEGINNING!
Before this sublime and glorious end will be consummated, there,
will be formed an infinite number of suns and worlds, the immensity
of some of which will pass all power of understanding and computation, and their revolutions on their axes will require as many hours
as this globe requires minutes. And all the labyrinths and chambers
of uncontracted infinitude are to be inhabited by corresponding systems of worlds.
And after animal and vegetable existence shall have been equally
disseminated throughout each of these systems, as active and unfail

ing agents to refine, appropriate to themselves, and transfer to higher
existences, all things below their state of being; and when all motion
shall have become so perfected as to result in Sensation; and when
all elements shall equally and reciprocally attract and associate with
each other; and when all worlds, having become too rarified to
form dense and gross bodies, shall ascend and gravitate to higher
spheres,-when all things shall have arrived at this state of exalted
perfection, then will be the accomplishment of the grand and glorious
End contemplated!
And here the thoughts, together with time and space, are nearly
lost and annihilated, from the utter impossibility of an adequate conception. And the tendency of the human mind to conceive of locality and bounds, and the impossibility of its conceiving of i??inity,
accounts for the obscurity and indefiniteness of these universal generalizations. If the mind were like Space, then thought would have
no boundary; and if the mind were like Time, Space would have no
distance.  But the habitation of the mind being thus contracted, all
thoughts of necessity give a correspondingly contracted conception of
infinity, or else there is no dtfinite conception.
The thought that all things in existence, all worlds with all their
diversified compositions, and even of their most dense and gross substances, are to become ultimately a part of animal organization; are
to become a medium of Sensation, and to constitute a casement in
which will exist the principle of spiritual /~, —this thought, in its
magnitude, is beyond the grasp of all minds except that of the Great
Actuator! And the accomplishment of the ultimate condition of the
Positive and Negative that shall then alone occupy the realms of
infinite space, is equally incomprehensible.
And the utter resolving of all things into a higher state of refinement, will make.them suitable to enter into the composition of nlew
worlds and systems of worlds, that may be born into existence by the
spontaneous pregnation of the Fountain in which nothing exists but
what is everlastingly pure and infinite!
Thus the vast Univerccelum has been nearly filled with conglobations of particles, which have assumed the forms of mighty Suns and
worlds. It still will be perpetuated through eternity, until not only
every particle shall compose some part of these systems, but until all
shall sustain and control by their specific influence, htlgher spheres;
until each and every particle existing shall occupy an important sta

tion in the great united System. thrown into existence and controlled
by the almighty fiat of internal and eternal Power! Such is the grand
cosmogony of the creations in universal space!
11. It is, therefore, made evident to the mind, that the great
[NTERNAL, INVISIBLE, is the REAL REALITY of all producing
causes; that this is Eternal Truth; and that such is the essential
and specific nature, quality, and composition of the Eternal Iind!
And there are constantly emanating from this great Source, radiations of inexpressible and inconceivable Attributes, the first of which
is Power and Motion, and the last, and the highest and most excellent of all others, is Etcernal Truth!  And the great fiery Ocean of
chaotic Matter that has breathed into being the GRAND SYSTEM of
worlds, with all their appendages and excellent qualifications, was a
universal Exterior or Form, and a Vehicle of Power, that radiated
from the Intcrnal.  It was a Form produced by the Invisible, yet
real existing Principle-the ILfinite Mind.
Therefore the Great eternal Interior, and the Great eternal Exterior, constituted the only Principle and Form in being. And as an
atmosphere of eternal elements was gradually and perpetually evolved,
this constituted the Great Sun-which was a Form of the Interior.
The Great Sun may be called an atimos-phere or Form  surrounding
the Great Positive Mind; and the elements emanating from it agtain,
nay be called an atmosphcre of that indefinite Mass of liquid fire!
Thus all thingrs have an interior, and a correslpondi1ng externalljornm.
There is likewise an aeriform emanation proceeding from every form
and substance in universal space.  Every atom in existence has precisely the same constituents as had the undeveloped WORLD of unparticled matter.  One eternal and immutable Law pervades all matter
in existence. One Law, equalled with Matter, produces all things,
and gives birth constantly to new worlds by its progressive unfoldings.
Being therefore immutable, it can not react, can not change; nor can
there be any retrogression.  Progression is the main attribute, the
specific effect of established and immutable laws.  Activity in all
things, and throughout all words and systems in immensity, is an inevitable result of the same Principle.  Adjustment and harmony, refinement and purification, are also the necessary effects of Nature's
established laws. And as in the beginning there were but two Principles-two real Realities-there can not now be any greater number in the universe.  Power and Matter, Internal and External

152            NATURE'S DIVINE IREVELATIONS.
Positive and Negative, Cause and Effect, were the only coupled existing Principles —the only real realities that were, or ever can be,
in the Universe. There are, however, unnumbered millions of worlds,
and suns incalculable that produced them, and innumerable kinds of
earth and terra-compositions in being. —And there are also numerous
mineral forms, and many supposed original elements, and various
species of plants, animals, and intelligent organizations, disseminated
upon the surfaces of these worlds.  There. are also gases, which, in
their appearances and qualities, and in the relations which they sustain to each other and to the bodies that are found to contain them,
are greatly diversified; and they are extremely dissimilar in their apparent combinations and compositions.  And finally, there al))ecar to
be in the Universe, an indefinite number of directly opposite and
antagonlistic substances, essences, qualities, and principles. All these
are but peculiar associations of bodies, atoms, and elements, contained
in the great Whol; and are but modifications of the inherent quality
contained in the undeveloped Sun of the Univerccelum.
And as the Outer must be, and is, an emanation from the Interntl[,
or Centre, so that which surrounds, is not an antagonist of-is not
oJl)josed to —is in perfect harmony with, the internal; and both
united, by virtue of their inherent power, and acting harmoniously
and reciprocally, produce Eternal Motion.  Therefore there are no
opposites-no antagonistic principles existing in the realms of infinite space.
Therefore the motions of all worlds, and their distances from each
other, and these all from the Centre, are determined-not N(Otdo 0nistictlily, but by reason of the relative internal affinities that they
sustain to each other.  They are not rvpulsed-not rejected from
any antjalthy, but are harmoniously and reciprocally given off, that
they may gravitate to some like substance or principle existing in
some part of the remote regions of space.
Thus all things in Nature are incessantly and harmoniously seeking their equilibrium.  And throughout the vast system of planetary
formations, there is constantly a universal reciprocation.  And there
will eternally exist the same harmony which now pervades the worlds
of undefinable space.  And all Matter and Motion willrinally become
what they originally were — will be resolved into one grand and glorious SUN, more refined and perfected, more excellent in all its qualities and compositions, that it may again bring forth a nlew System of
suns, and an infinite correspontding creation throughout space! And

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.              153
as there is in ull things a constant evolving and emanation, development and progression, from the Centre, of refined essences which
dispose themselves in concentric circles, this is a representation of
the great Circles that surrounded the infinite Sun, -and of the great
Circle of development from the beginning of time (or of the present
formation) to the final arrival of every particle at the Great Centre
and Parent from which they all emanated!
This may be termed the begrrinning' and end of ONE TIME: for this
contracted idea is the most extensive one that the mind can possibly conceive upon this subject. Yet this is one grand Circle of
united and-harmonious motion, life, and activity. And the final resolution of the present creations in infinite space, will be the consummation of the glorious End contemplated. And then the Great Sun,
becoming thus more perfected, will breathe forth new and more
refined elements, and roll into space successively a corresponding,
yet more, far more perfect Univerccelum!
~ 12. The endless concatenation of causes by which infinite space
has been filled with systems of unnumbered worlds, was originally
established by the force and spontaneous action of the WVill of the
Eternal Mind! His Will is the executive Power, actuating all
things throughout eternity; and by immutable and changeless laws it
has filled immensity with motion, life, and activity.  This Will (as
an Effect of the Infinite Mind) was the first Cause of all things; and
being balanced by proper materials, the Whole was capable of being
incessantly developed. And this development has been, and still is,
going on unceasingly throughout space!
An understanding therefore that all things in being have emanated
from this exhaustless Fountain of never-ending materials, and a comprehension of the nature, quality, and essence, of the First Eternal
Cause, affords to the human mind a proper and indestructible basis
on which it may rest a correct understanding of the nature of all
FIffects.  The innumerable classifications made of effects throughout
Nature; the very different sciences that have been erected, both
upon appearances and unwarrantable hypotheses; and the apparently
extreme opposites, such as heat and cold, light and darkness, life and
death, activity and repose, and all their intermediates, should be
viewed in the light in which they will appear from having the changeless Law of the eternal Positive Mind impressed distinctly upon the
understanding. And then, having for the foundation of reasoning





## p. 154 (#182) ############################################


154            NATURE S DIVINE 1REVELATIONSo
that which is everlasting and infinite, the mind would be led to a
proper understanding of all appearances, forms, and effects, issuing
therefrom.
Every particle in being is constantly passing throughforms, orders,
and degrees.  This is a universal Law of Matter.  Every particle in
existence is unceasingly seeking association and equilibrium. This
also is an unchangeable effect of,the immutable laws of Causation.
Every form or association of atoms, whether in a small or large body,
has a previous correspondent. And every correspondent is a type,
symbol, and representative, of higher and more perfect spheres than
that which it occupies.  This incessant motion, and the various
stages which each atom is destined and compelled to pass through,
are only means used to produce higher states of refinement and perfection.  No quality, substance, or essence, ever occupies a state
below that which it previously occupied: but the space that it previously filled is supplied by some kindred substance or element that
has become fitted to occupy the same place; while the substance or
principle that has occupied that place, progresses onward and upward
to higher spheres of purity and refinement.
Therefore by properly understanding one atom with all its constituents, the mind would be comprehending a globe. And a proper
conception of a globe would lead to a knowledge of the Centre
around which it revolves. And an understanding of the SLun, with
all its appendages, and of the laws governing and actuating them in
their motions and revolutions, would give the mind a true conception
of the GREAT ETERNAL SUN and CENTRE, with all systems that
are controlled by its mighty power and influence!
Therefore the lowest of all things contains the highest and most
pe'fect.  And when the highest becomes thus developed, it is capable of pervading and complrehending all below its exalted state of
perfection.
Thus the grand and glorious Univerccelum displays the substances,
qualities, and essences, existing in the great material Fountain; and
likewise the pure Intelligence and infinite perfection, contained in the
great Vortex of the Eternal Positive Mind!
Many elements, combinations, and principles, appear externally
very dissimilar. Disorder and confusion are apparently everywhere
visible. General and special interferences are seemingly existing,
when things are particularly or minutely considered.  But when the
grand general contemplation of the great Sij.ctem of eternal forma




## p. 155 (#183) ############################################


NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               15~
tions with their attributes and characteristics, is presented to the
mind, it carries the impression of Truth, and of the superlative harmony and calm tranquillity that are existing in every department of
the Universe and of eternity!  All things are energetically, yet
quietly passing from a lower stage of being to a higher and more
perfect one; and all qualities and essences, controlled by the Omnipotent Actuator, are likewise performing their revolutions with
an inconceivable power, yet are apparently motionless, calm, and
tranquil!
And throughout immensity there is perfect unity, harmony, and
reciprocation.  There is no unjust absorption; no unequal and unnecessary attraction; no destroying or annihilating of one body or
particle for the immediate or isolated and selfish supply of another;
no unequitable drawing from any parts, qualities, or elements, to sustain others.  But all give to, and take from, each other, only that
which is necessary and useful to each. All are incessantly changing
and exchanging, acting and reacting, organizing and reorganizing,
mutually, throughout the realms of infinite space! All is harmony,
peace, and quietness. All things were eternally established with the
inexpressible perfection of these attributes and qualities, and consequently are eternally manifesting the same throughout the multifarious forms of immensity! All things are indices of the great Supernal Power! The almighty and everlasting Perfection that inhabits the Vortex of eternity, is constantly and eternally breathing forth
these inexpressible excellences; whose breath is as a mighty fiat,
rolling into being unnumbered systems of worlds, forms, and entities;
and the character of whose emanations is expressed in the tranquil.manifestations that are observed in every form and motion in the
Universe!
And unspeakably grand and glorious is the End contemplated:
for while considering all worlds as one World, and the great Whole
as but an atom in comparison to that which shall exist, the design is
manifest, that the Whole may, by virtue of inherent attributes,
power, and motion, ultimately become a substance, a quality, a principle, of so refined and perfected a nature that it may associate with
the celestial forms and Spheres-being a counterpart and equal associlte of the Great Pow~'er that forced all things from their original
condition!
Such, therefore, is the magnificent and harmonious System instituted by the Great Positive Mind;-and while the great Universe

,66           NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
presents itself to the mind, its grand attributes and qualities must be
equally and as indelibly impressed. And this will throw a light
upon the human mind, which is above the glory and brightness
of all lights,-the knowledge of PERFEcT and ETERNAL HAPPINESS!
For while existing in forms, as mankind now are existing, they
should conform to the immutable laws of Matter.  And being as
particles composing the great WYhole, they should be governed and
actuated by the exalted and most perfect principles that are established in the Law of the material Universe. And conforming to
these harmonious and immovably-established laws, they would form a
perfect and harmonious System —a true correspondent of the vast
Universe! Then all motion would be such as to produce good
results. All parts would equally reciprocate with each other, as a
principle of universal interest. And there would be no isolation, no
absorption, no extraneous parts and forms in being; but all would be
necessarily required and adapted to make the whole a pe?fect System-of never-ending happiness and peace! And as forms would
be constantly assuming new spheres and new stations, according to a
progressive ascension, the Whole would be a united, organized
System, a Circle, a representation of all else throughout the Universe! And as all these things would occur by the inevitable and
unchangeable consequences of immutable law, the great Mass would
be an harmonious [Thole —composed of parts each of which would
b)e absolutely necessary to make the great Whole perfect.
And the Whole thus existing, would receive the tranquillizing influence of DIVINE LAW, whose very essence is the perfection of
Goodness and Truth.  Then opposites would not be known; for
Knowledge and Truth would annihilate their visible appearance and
seemingly destructive influence from the Universe for ever. And
then the Truth of all truths; the Real of all realities; the foundation
of all happiness and peace,-would be of itself a universal balm of
tranquillity! And the whole would be as a great Sun, containing the
essences of all else; and it would develop those indestructible attributes whose foundation is eternal, and whose nature and Parent are
everlasting and infinite.  Then all would breathe forth that spontaneous reciprocation which would banish for ever from the face of the
earth, every quality and principle of a sccmingly opposite nature
And then there would be flowing throughout the Universe the evidence of the eternal Truth that opposites do not exist: and all

appearances of the, same would be swallowed up in the great flood of
light and knowledge!*
~13. The original state of matter in space, and its general combinations and characteristics, have thus been presented to the world for
consideration and investigation, - together with the general laws and
principles indivisibly connected with the Great Mass. And the general modus operandi of the Universe; the formation and constitution
of worlds, and the relations that they sustain to each other, have also
been presented for contemplation.
The basis of all true scientific and philosophical investigations, is
the original Cause and beginning of all things (considered as a Univerccelum  of Power and Materials), and the general and consequent
effects resulting from the original organization of Matter and Motion.
And the thoughts having been carried back to the Centre of infinite
space, where existed only the universal Sun from which all things
sprang into being, the mind has been led to consider the successive
Formations of innumerable suns and worlds in circles of development.
In attempting to follow each formation of worlds, it becomes lost in
the immensity of the subject.  It therefore requires nearer and more
tangcible subjects of thought than those which have been in this general manner considered.
Evidence may be received in favor of what has been said, from all
well-ascertained truths in science and Nature.  Indeed, the conviction that Nature presses upon the mind is irresistible.  And evidence
of truth has its foundation only in the unchangeable manifestations of
Nature; for all truths, being eternal, are established in that which is
also eternal, -and are consequently therein manifested. The various
scientific and philosophical facts and truths, and all theories that are
immovably established, will converge in their respective conclusions
* The Clairvoyant here remarked that lie found a crowd of thoughts pressing upon
his mind which language was utterly inadequate to express. But, said he, "these
thoughts and sentiments will be ultimately known and felt; and then they will be
known to be absolutely inexpressible."  In view of the harmony and just and benign
reciprocation that pervade the whole vast Universe of worlds and systems, M2an, he
said, should feel very much depressed; inasmuch as he is the only being who has pursued a course of isolated and selfish action, and been governed by laws which never
did and never can exist in Nature, or in the plans and institutions of the Great Mind.
Of his many intensely interesting incidental remarks, the world must for the most
part be deprived. We may print some faint expressions of his ideas, but we can not
print the solemn impressiveness, and celestial purity of manner, in which they were
presented.

and formn a united evidence of the truth of the things herein presented.
Still, as prior causes are both internal and invisible, although they
produce effects visible, these are not always correctly manifested to
the senses.  For effects are exceedingly changed in their aoppearance
by incidental and surrounding causes. At times, however, effects are
truly visible; but only when conditions and circumstances are extremely favorable.  Still, effects constantly occur; and these again
are the cause of others; so that all things are developed by a concatenation of established causes, each of which follows the specific guidance of an immutable Law. Therefore the innumerable causes that
produce corresponding effects, are all referable to some established
P'rinciple that is demonstratively known by its results to be unchangealble.
This knowledge of Nature begets a reposing confidence in the
minds of those who comprehend it, that all laws, principles, elements,
and compositions, are an emanation from some great, unchanging,
inexhaustible Fountain of Truthl!  Therefore in her laws-in her
attributes and manifestations, are based the confidence and the firm
and deliberate researches of all true investigators.
In contemplating creations of such indefinite magnitude, the mind
becomes lost in the realms of immensity; for it is incompetent
to grasp the mighty Universe while it exists in the present sphere of
being. Therefore the magnificent Solar System with which our own
planet is immediately connected, shall next be the subject of investigation and revealment.  And.as it has been shown that a proper understanding of one particle composing the great Universe, would lead
to a correct knowledge of the Universe itself, so a revealing of the
successive creations, from the sun to the condensation of this globe,
will lead analogically to a proper understanding of the mighty Univerccelum of eternity! And by a course of mathematical calculations, and astronomical, geological, and physiological explanations,
will be revealed the order and condition of creations in the solar
system, and especially as relating to this globe.  And as science is
partially disseminated and generally accessible in the present sphere,
the creation will be considered scientifically and philosophically, for
the especial purpose of carrying deeper conviction of truths heretofore
proclaimed!
And as Truth alone has an indestructible basis, nothing is to be
apprehended from its inevitable results; but we may fearlessly erect
upon its foundation, a Temple of the utmost magnificence. The

materials of which this is to be composed, are the universal evidences
flowing through every indescribable vein and avenue of creation. Its
parts will make a whole without imperfection; its pillars will be the
united volumes of never-ending Truth; and its covering will be a
mantle of eternal peace and tranquillity. Its appearance will be like
the infinite light and grandeur of boundless attributes when all conjoined and united; and it will indelibly and unchangeably impress
the whole world with the glorious brilliancy and splendor of the Great
Positire Mind! And from this great Temple will issue forth those
all-subduing and tranquillizing principles that will establish universal
knowledge, happiness, purity, and perfection! This Temple will be
an emblem of the nature and attributes of the Divine Mind;-and
all the grandeur and magnificence of these attributes will be properly
seen and felt when a knowledge of their unchanging essences and
principles shall be obtained by a proper and unrestricted investigation.
Thus I leave the vast Univerecelum that fills all space (and space
is annihilated to the conceptions), and commence revealing the creation of the SOLAR SYSTEM and of THIS WORLD.
The ternls WTorld, and Universe, and Nature, shall hereafter be
applied as significant of the present Solar System, and of the globes
therein existing. For neither of these terms is sufficiently strong to
comprehend in its meaning, the unnumbered worlds of space! Therefore the same that has been used, must be still applied to the subjects
of the forthcoming investigations. And general scientific terms and
technical expressions will be employed likewise.
~ 14. The wonderful Sun or Centre to which our Solar System
belongs, is but a remote planet of another System existing prior to its
formation. And in accordance with the general classification of suns
and worlds in the Universe, its planets and satellites may be considered as satellites and asteroids belonging to a planet, and that planet
as belonging to a sun.*
* The matter contained in this and the three following sections, was delivered on the
16th, 17th, and 20th of March, 1846. The statement here concerning the revolution
of the Sun, as a planet, around a centre in the depths of immensity, is verified by the

160             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
The sun is an accumulation and agglomeration of particles thrown
from other spheres; and these became united according to the law
of mutual and inherent attraction. Its igneous composition contains
Hleat, Light, and Electricity, the successive developments of all primeval matter existing in an agglomerated condition, and subjected to
the general law governing all matter.  The materials constituting the
sun, like those composing all other bodies, were thrown from other
bodies during their revolutions around their common Centre, by a
force termed the centrifiugal force, or the tendency that a revolving
body has to throw particles from its surface. In this manner, and by
a mutual gravitation and consequent congregation of particles, the
Sun assumed its distinct existence and form. And being governed
by the same law, it has the same motions with all other celestial,
spheres, and revolves on its axis with wonderful velocity, and in an
elliptic orbit, around the inconceivable Centre to which it belongs.
Thus, the Sun has two original motions: one upon its axis, and
the other in its orbit around a greater Centre.  The heavy or dense
particles composing it, took the lowest point in the great Body. The
more refined, assumed and sustained different distances and stations
from the lowest, in accordance with the density or rarity of each particle. Its inconceivable igneous centre was an accumulation of those
particles whose density would not permit them to occupy higher
stations.
Therefore the great internal portion of the Sun is an immense mass
of liquid fire, evolving successively heat, light, and electricity, as developed and purified particles of its interior composition.  The
evolved atmosphere may be considered as a part of the great Body,
-still an emanation from the nucleus as resulting from its own spontaneous action. This atmosphere, or immense nebulous zone of accumnulated particles, extended to the orbit that the extreme planet occupies, and traverses as a cometary body.  This is one more planet
than is now known, and has not yet been detected by the observations
made through the medium of the most powerful symbol of the human eye.
The existence of eight planets has been determined upon as nearly
recent discoveries of Maedler, a Russian astronomer, of whi'ch discoveries the clairvoyant in his normal state had no knowledge, neither had either of his associates,
until many months after this was delivered! From the apparent motions of the fixed
stars, Maedler has deduced the conclusion that the Solar System is moving around a
point in the direction of Pleiades, requiring many millions of years to complete a single
revolution!

beyond all doubt.* Still the cighth and ninth are not yet recognised
as bodies belonging to the Solar System. But the orbit that the last
one occupies, was the extreme circumference of the atmospheric emanation from the sun.
All emanations were governed by the law of centrifugal force, and
the natural tendency of each particle to seek its own congenial association, or the equilibrium of its dense or rare composition. And the
great Whole revolved with one united motion on its own axis, and
also around its unimaginable orbit in the great plane observed by all
suns and planets from the first stages of their existence. And this
was elliptical, -rendered so by virtue of the primary force given each
atom that compose the great Body.
There was contained in this great Sun, matter to compose all the
planets which have subsequently been formed, with all their satellites
and appendages; likewise all the forms possessing motion, life, and
activity, which are universally disseminated upon their surfaces. And
all were successively developed by virtue of inherent laws established
from the great original Source.  There was incessantly passing from.
the great Centre, as aided by both of its motions, particles, atoms,
and substances that had become sufficiently refined to assume higher
spheres in the great Mass.
Its magnitude being inconceivable, and its diameter not to be cal —
culated by any mathematical process, it was composed of strautications, or rather of different bodies developed one after another.
These great developments may be generalized as follows: From the
igneous or unformed centre was developed lheat.  The extreme of
this was the commencement of light; and this was the second formation. Electricity followed next, as a consequent development of
the latter.  And the last active fluid extended to the utmost extreme
of the whole Mass and its successive radiations.
Thus fire, heat, light, and electricity, were the general! elementscomposing the Sun.  W'ithout these, it would not have been a sun.
*At first I did not understand this expression; and it is but recently that it occurired to me that it evidently has reference to the conclusions which Le Verrier had'
already established in his own mind from mathematical calculations) and which the
clairvoyant saw. Numerous witnesses can testify that what is said'about an eighrk
and ninth planet, was in manuscript in March, 1846, and months before Le Verrier's
calculations and conclusion hbd been announced in this country. The eighth planet
was first actually observed in September, 1846. These facts cannot but be regarded
as important, proving, as they do, the ability of the clairvoyant- to obtain knowledge-of
things beyond the reach of the natural senses, and hence as imparting confidence ivL
his revealments which can not he verified by any process of:.islor-irivestigation.

And these are elements the nature and relations of which lead to a
proper understanding of all other bodies, forms, substances, and elements,- and likewise of the law that controls them.
It is necessary to bear in mind the proposition, that the circumference of the sun's atmosphere extended to the orbit that is now
occupied by the ninth planet of our Solar System. And it is also
necessary to understand the two great motions of the sun, especially
that in its elliptic orbit, around a more inconceivable Centre. And
then it will be conceived that by virtue of the throwing off or centrifugal force which the great Body generates in its motion, atoms
will pass outward from the centre, in the direction of the plane that
the body is observing in its motion. Also, the accumulation of particles at the extremes of its elliptic orbit is greater than at any other
point or locality around the great central body. This approximate
agglomeration of particles, in becoming condensed, will be considered as following the general law which governs the motion of all
bodies and particles.
And it will be perceived that according to the law of eternal reciprocation and gravitation of particles, there would not have been an
accumulation at these localities had not the particles that were thrown
off, previously become suitable to associate and conjoin with particles
that were there already existing.  Therefore no law of positive attraction actuated them, or withdrew them  from particles to which
they previously adhered, —nor did any law of positive repztlsionl repel
them from their original station.  Neither repulsion nor attraction as:a law, and as these are generally understood, produced any effect
upon these foreign particles.  But there was a mutual gravitation (or
association) of suitable materials and atoms to assume such a form.
~15. The great Centre having its successively developed atmospheres, or strata of elements, extending to the last development of.electricity, this highest of all material refinements pervaded the
lower, entering into every particle where it had been originally contained and developed. And this being the subtle, active agent contained in every particle, it penetrated to the lowest depths of the
great Sun thus existing, and extended to an undefinable expanse
throughout space.  Being thus subtle, active, and powerful, it became a pervading agent, operating upon every particle and substance
in the vast composition,-transmitting and interchanging particles

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 163
and their qualities to other immediate spheres or stations which they
were required to fill.
And this being the active, energetic, and all-pervading fluid, ths
ultimate principle of the great Mass, the particles that accumulated
and agglomerated at the extreme point of the elliptic orbit of the
Sun's revolution, were inherently associated by virtue of this fluid,
and by the specific density or rarity of the particles that were thrown
to that station by the centrifugal action that the immense Sun
had in both of its inconceivable motions.  Electricity was the medium and active agent to transmit and transfer every molecular substance to new stations.  It may be considered a mediator, or an
associating principle that unites antagonistic particles. It is no less
an all-pervading influence, acting upon the highest and lowest particles of every state of material association. And it gyrates from the
lowest to the highest, uniting and associating all particles according
to the density or rarity of such, until it reaches the highest point, or
forms an association with principles of its own affinity.
Such is the invisible, controlling element, whose results are known
as laws. It is an energetic principle which actuates all ultimate motion in the immense Body of material constitution. And by this
subtle fluid, and the motion originally given to the Sun, was formed
at the farthest point of its elliptic orbit, the body heretofore described as the ninth planet, or rather the cometary body that traverses
the outermost circle of the Sun's atmosphere.
The magnitude of the great body's circumference and diameter,
is unnecessary to represent, even if it were possible.  It is sufficient
to understand that the great Sun, in bulk and magnitude, extended
to the orbit of the farthest cometary body. And a proper comprehension of the modus aescrnus of all motion, and the laws which it
develops, should be the basis on which all scientific investigations
and philosophical researches as pertaining to subjects of this nature,
should be founded.
All that is known as motion or activity, does not give to the mind
an adequate conception of the laws that produce such.  But as the
mind depends upon a proper understanding of motion to conceive of
planetary formations in the Solar System, so there should be an un
derstanding of the nature and cause of motion, and of the general
law which such inevitably and invariably follows. And the principles existing in, and which are coeval with, Matter, should also be
permanently settled in the mind. Then general causes will be

164            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
expected to produce invariable corresponding effects; and cause and
effect will be perceived to exist as one general Principle.
Still there are thousands of intermediate motions produced by incidental and subordinate causes.  But if such motions were innumerable, and if all their minute manifestations and results were different from what might be expected from the general law, they could
not be considered as subverting or interrupting the action of the general and established principles of motion in Nature.
Moti6n is the effect that one body produces upon another.  Ifa substance or body be dense, its pressure or action upon another substance
will be in proportion to its density, and will produce proportionate
effects. All particles thus act on each other, both separately and
combined. Therefore a universal motion exists: for the action of
one particle will set in motion every other particle, whether single or
compound, in the Universe! The movements of all things therefore
are graduated in accordance with the station of the substance, and its
grossness or refinement. And the very moment the original impetus
was given to Matter, the ceaseless motion of all bodies throughout
space was eternally established! Motion can not be comprehended,
or adequately accounted for, on any other principle known to characterize any form of combined elements: and on this ground only
may be rested an understanding of its cause and manifestations.
And we should regard motion as existing in primeval matter, or in
time past too remote for conception, as constituting the general Principle of Matter, and as being the highest and most perfect attribute
of interior development.
The impetus given the first particle, being all-powerful, is the cause
of all subsequent motion. Therefore Motion is an eternal Principle
existing in Matter, established by infinite Power.  Then in considering the innumerable movements and manifestations of Nature, the
basis of the investigation should consist in this originally-established
Principle; and from this should be expected general developments
of motion as corresponding to the universal law.
By thus considering Motion and its nature and Cause, the mind
will be led to a proper understanding of the formation of the Sun,
and of the law that controlled its mighty movements. The grand
and most important motion belonging to the Sun, is the one it
performs in its orbit around a more unimaginable Centre. The
cause of this established motion was the impetus given the Sun by
the powerful throwing off of particles from the Centre to which it





## p. 165 (#193) ############################################


NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               1
belongs, and the incessant and violent force that accompanied the
reception of them.
This extensive and mighty accumulation constantly going on
throughout countless ages, produced the Sun, of such mighty dimensions as have been described.  And this impetus originally given it,
produced a corresponding motion in an elliptic orbit, at a distance
from its Sun in proportion to its density and magnitude. And the
motion it has upon its own axis is the still more violent motion that
was given it by the reception of particles which came with such velocity as to cause it almost instantly to revolve. The motion given
tit was thus the result of the impulse of moving particles, the tendency of which was to produce like motion. This motion therefore
was a natural consequence of a kindly reciprocation of atoms. And
comparative condensation was an inevitable result, caused not only
by the accumulation at the centre, of dense particles that associated
more closely with each other, but by an escape of the more refined
parts, which assumed higher stations in the vast body.
~ 16. The ninth planet (or cometary body), being composed of
particles accumulated by the motion of the great Sun, observed the
same plane by the same specific force; and obeying the law of reciprocal gravitation, it occupied its assumed orbit at a distance in accordance with its rarity and peculiar constitution.
The eighth planet was next evolved, observing the same principles
of formation and the same general law of motion, and was situated
within the orbit of the former merely because its composition was
more dense than the first one evolved. Its occupying the sphere thus
described, is therefore only in harmony with the established principles of gravitation, and of orbicular and rotary motions. As the
eighth and ninth planets have not yet been recognised as belonging
to our solar system, there can be no conception of the original magnitude and diameter of the Sun, as including its extended atmosphere.
But while a proper understanding of the law and nature of Motion,
and how Matter, in large portions, agglomerates and takes lower or
higher stations according to its specific gravity or levity,-is essential to a proper investigation and comprehension of the accumulation
and formation of matter into planets, satellites, and asteroids, —this
is equally necessary, as affording a basis on which the mind may rest
geological researches,-and upon which latter, again, may rest a
proper conception of all ulterior effects and developments.

166            NATURE'S D].VINE REVELATIONS.
There are, however, elements which are apparently not controlled
by the same general law.  Various observations made by different
persons upon the subject of heat, light, and electricity, have led them
to different opinions and speculations in reference to the character,
attributes, and governing principle of each of these elements.  It is
well here to observe that those who have formed dissimilar theories
in reference to heat and light, have done so while these elements
were manifested under incidental and modifying circumstances. And
the result of such observations has been to obscure to the mind the
operations of the general law that governs all elements in being.
Heat (or caloric) has been supposed to be governed by a law different from that governing liht: and electricity, being as yet an undefined and incomprehensible principle, has also been designated as a
different substance, and supposed to be governed by a different law
from the last two mentioned.  Hence it is again evident that detailed
and minute observations have not been adequate to establish a universal real-reality of laws as governing all elements in being.
It has been heretofore proved by indubitable evidence, that the great
Centre or Sun, as one substance, develops these successively as atmospheric elements, according to the law of refinement and progression.  However this theory may differ fiom previous speculations,
that does not alter its truth, nor the evidence which naturally accompanies the same, to the mind. For it is demonstrated beyond a
doubt, that all matter and elements are fundamentally and essentially
the same, and that a diffccent law can not govern any particle or element in the Universe, from that inherent Law eternally established.
Still the manifestations and effects of these different principles are
exceedingly dissimilar, according to the circumstances under which
they are developed to the observations of outward investigators.
For particular appearances in these, as in all other things, are inevitably dissimilar; and to base conclusions upon such appearances,
even if such have been successively observed for years, would be
to lose sight of the grand general Principle of the Universe, and
to endeavor to establish a theory upon the basis of corporeal and exterior manifestations.  But properly understanding that all Matter in
its primeval state, was of an igneous constitution, it follows as a consequence that all things existing must partake and be composed of
materials from the same great Mass.
Therefore heat, light, and electricity, are still matter; but each
occupies a different station, lower or higher, according to its re

spective degree of refinement.  And the constant emanations of
each are governed by the original attributes established in the eternal
law of motion as producing progressive development in all things.
This, therefore, constitutes the grand general LaW that governs all
elements in space.
But let it be distinctly borne in mind, that the peculiar circumnstances and conditions under which these elements may be situated, will
correspondingly modify their visible efflcts.  This observation will
lead to a proper understanding of the amount of heat and li,ght which
the eighth planet receives from the Sun.  The ultimate discovery of
this celestial body, and its revolution and diameter being specified,
will contribute greatly to advance the interesting science of astronomy, particularly when the aberrations and refractions of light
are known as they occur between it and the Sun around which it
revolves.
Its density is four fifths that of water. Its diameter it is unnecessary to determine.  Its period of revolution can be inferred analogically from the period in which Uranus traverses its elliptic and almost
inconceivable orbit.  The atmosphere of the eighth planet is exceedingrly rare, containing little oxygen, but being mostly composed of
fluorine and nitrogen.  No organic constitution that exists upon the
earth, could exist there alive for one moment.  The human eye
would be a useless organ; for light there is of such a nature as
to render its darkness, even at the darkest period, several hui.
dred degrees lighter than the light which the earth receives from
the sun!
It has, like Uranus, six satellites. These were evolved and formed
by the two motions given this planet; the farthest from the primary
being the extent of its original composition, and the nearest being an
accumulation of denser atoms from the planet. Therefore, the planet itself being made up of denser materials than any of its satellites,
the respective distances of the latter from the planet, with their diameters and periods of revolution, are determined by their respective
compositions, and the relations they sustain to each other.
The period of time that elapsed since the sun, by its own inherent
tendency, commenced organizing this unimaginable body, could not
be possibly conceived of. And the time in which the satellites were
produced and developed, is also beyond the computation of the most
erudite mathematician. Numbers may be added to numbers; trillions
may be multiplied by still higher numbers, yet the amount of figures

produced would not represent the number of years or even centuries
in which such a formation could be developed!
It is wholly unfitted for the habitation of any organic constitution:
yet life will ultimately cover its now undisturbed surfaces.
~ 17. The planet produced as next in order, was HERSCHEL or
URANUS. During its first stages of formation, it was an accumulation of inter-associated, igneous, rarified particles, whose rarity unfitted them for any other sphere of association.  The diameter of the
planet previous to any other formation now belonging to its system,
was nearly three millions of miles!  By virtue of inherent motion,
six satellites were successively developed.  The most rarjfied accumulation was the sixth satellite; and the most unrefined and dense,
was that nearest to the planet. —And each satellite was gradually
and steadily produced by the established laws of association and condensation.
The diameter of the planet at the present time is thirty-five thousand one hundred and twelve miles; the farthest satellite being nearly
one million and a half miles from its primary. The satellite nearest
the planet, is not much further than the moon is from the earth.
The revolutions of these satellites around their centre, as observed
by the telescope, are very unlike those of any other satellites belonging to any of the planets of the Solar System. For while Uranus
revolves obliquely on its axis, its satellites observe an angular, inclined
rotation,-this apparent dissimilitude of general and rotary motions
creating wonder and astonishment in the minds of astronomers!
Uranus also is often apparently eclipsed by her extremely eccen.
tric appendages. Thus blue and dark spots are occasionally observed
upon its surface,-its light being slightly intercepted by a bluish or
crimson tint, and rarely by a dark one.  Still the observations that
have been made on the satellites of Uranus, do not establish the absolute conviction that such contra-eccentricities do really exist among
them; because at different periods, the appearance of their motions
is not the same. And this fact was frequently observed by its discoverer; but he afterward became convinced of the angular and ellip
tic motions of this planet's satellites.
Being fully convinced that the true motions will yet be discovered,
and that they are in unison and harmony with those of the satellites
of kindred planets, it is unnecessary at present to decide respecting
the true plane and form of the orbits observed by these satellites; for

such would tend to retard astronomical investigations, and to destroy
those efforts that are useful and necessary to the unfolding of the
mind and to the due appreciation of scientific truth.*
The rotation of this planet on its axis has not as yet been discovered; especially the time it occupies in. a single revolution. The
velocity with which it revolves is absolutely inconceivable. It is for
this reason that it has not as yet been determined, -notwithstanding
its orbicular and almost incalculable revolution has been established
and specified.  How much undisturbed thought and deep calculation
has this computation required! And how ingenious have been the
inventions of man, whereby he has been enabled to observe, investigate, and demonstrate, the works of Infinite Power, whose harmonious and peaceful institutions are so absorbing and attractive to the
mind!  It revolves in its orbit around the sun once in eighty-four
years; its distance being over eighteen hundred millions of miles:
and it moves at the rate of fifteen thousand miles an hour!
Such is Uranus: and its magnificent appendages, being a part of
its own composition, they attend it in its wonderful revolutions around
the inconceivable Centre of our Solar System. —And the harmony
and sublime magnificence that this planet and its attendants display,
are not surpassed by any other body yet discovered.
Its atmosphere has a light reddish appearance. Its own body appears extremely opaque.  Its general manifestations are those of a
dense body, having a correspondingly dense atmosphere, with the
color before mentioned; and it is characterized by an inconceivable
velocity of rotary'motion, and by the eccentricities heretofore described
as-observed in the motions of its satellites.  The real density of the
planet is a little more than that of water; and the constitutions of its
appendages are correspondingly rare.
It is not filled, like those between it and the Sun, with life and
activity; nor has its surface been shaded by the growth of plants or
trees.  No life of any kind exists there; nor can there, until further
condensation and development occur. For its atmosphere is of an
igneous and carbonaceous constitution, having one three hundred and
sixtieth part carbon to one of oxygen. Still, this is not carbon of the
nature of that which the primary formation of the earth developed,
* The author here appears to express an opinion from analogy without seeking for
a superior impression. This may be explained by the remark that it is contrary to
his invariable practice, to relieve mental effort by imparting information on subjects
accessible to the mind by ordinary processes. The same remark explains the reason
why he does not define the orbits, diameters, &c., of the eighth and ninth planets.

and is absolutely unlike any element or gas that is known upon the
earth.
It has no geological developments further than the igneous, primary
coating or crust that now envelops it.  But according to the laws of
progression, reciprocation, and development, condensation of particles will occur, and others will be evolved, and thus its surface will
yet become suitable for the habitation of plants and animals, whose
constitution will be firm and powerful.
Centuries after centuries will elapse before any apparent change
can be visible upon the surface of this planet.  Generations after
generations will pass, and their observations and explorations will be
lost and forgotten, and their thoughts and theories will be but little
known, before mankind shall observe different appearances in Uranus
and its appendages. But although change is slow, it is ineritable.
Even if it is not observed for centuries, this affords no convincing
proof against the ceaseless and eternal motion in Matter.  Observation has not discovered the velocity of the rotary motion of this
planet (and hence it appears to be motionless),- for the reason that it
moves with such frightful rapidity and inconceivable force, that the
human vision is unable to distinguish its movements. Such is the
seventh planet belonging to the great Sun of the Solar System!
18. Many objections have been made against the idea of uniformity and progressive development in the formations of our planetary system.  There are many articultzrs that are thought to be
contradictory of the truthfulness of the present theory.  The science
of astronomy has progressed according to the improvements made in
instruments for observation. The first principles of this science were
inductively conceived of many centuries ago, and during a period
when extreme disunion and desolating persecutions were on the earth.
During the ages when man had lost his connexion with the physical
sciences, the knowledge of which is necessary to lead him to a true
understanding of Nature and his inseparable connexion with her laws,
-this science, among others, was completely concealed, obscured,
and almost annihilated, from the minds of men. But since this time.
there have been many important discoveries; and opinions and
hypotheses have been formed as corresponding to the various observations that have been made.
Many faint and imperfect impressions were received in reference
to the origrn of the materials composing the Universe, including with

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                171
them a conception of the primal nebulous existence of all matter.
There were numerous appearances of Matter in nebulous forms remote from other bodies, the existence of which the most powerful
telescope would confirm. But according to the perfection of these
instruments, have these nebulous forms been resolved into stars, or
clusters of worlds. Still, not being able to resolve into stars all'such
forms that are visible, the nebulous hypothesis remained unmoved
until within a short period, when a still more powerful instrument
was constructed, and which resolves still more of these supposed nebulous compositions into apparent stars. And at this moment there is
but one spot that remains unresolved, within the powerful searchings
of this useful instrument.
The extensive generalizations, and the doctrine of progressive
development and design, that are herein presented, may therefore be
questioned: for as nebulous appearances become resolved into
spheres, the confidence in the above theory naturally diminishes.
And as the eighth and seventh planets have been described, together
with their compositions and constituents, it would be appropriate here
to mention that the (lptPwzrent contradictions which exist in the uniformity of this plan, may be explained and overcome by considering
them as particulars belonging to the great general law and plan upon
which the whole is instituted.
The satellites of Uranus apparently observe a different direction in
their orbicular revolutions from that observed by any other body or its
appendages.  Also the planet is less in magnitude relatively than
others, according to the lawv of progression. And its motions,
together with those of its satellites, are in the above particulars dissimilar to the motions observed by others in the Solar System. And
as at this time considerable inquiry is being instituted in reference to
these apparent anomalies and contradictions; and as these particulars
will eventually be familiarly understood, it is not absolutely necessary
to discuss them here; for they have no possible bearing upon the
general, ordained modus operalndi.
I will observe that generally the variations in the densities of planets receding from the Sun, are uniform; and that generally their orbicular velocity is in correspondence with the order and distance of
each planet from the great Centre.  Therefore Matter and Motion
being generally uniform and progressive in their manifestations, particulars can not controvert the truthfulness of this theory.  And by
understanding the universal plan of the planetary formations, these

172            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
particulars and apparent contradictions will be ultimately found to be
intermediate and subordinate manifestations of the general law, and
hence perfectly conformable thereunto.  And foreign causes which
have been brought to bear upon this planet, and not upon others
within its comprehensive orbit, have produced these dissimilar manifestations and results. And the effort which ambitious investigators
are now making, will result in the discovery of these incidental causes,
which, comparatively to the movements of the whole planetary systeln, are producing only incidental effects.
Therefore in questioning the truthfulness of the foregoing theory
it is positively necessary not to depend upon minute and detailed appearances; for such can not be taken as sufficient to counteract a
general principle, which is demonstrated by universal experience and
well-ascertained truths. Difficulties of this character must not be
considered as interfering with, or contradicting any general, universal,
and immutable laws which are constantly and invariably producing
their corresponding general effects. And being aware that the ultimate result of present investigations in reference to Uranus and its
revolving satellites, will be to demonstrate still more plainly the truth
of the present theory, I find it not particularly necessary to make further observations upon these apparent difficulties, and therefore leave
the result to the ambitious efforts of astronomical investigators.
~ 19. The planet next developed was the sixth, termed SATURN.
The condensation of particles existing in the great Sun whose circumference at this time extended to the orbit of Saturn, and a further
accumulation of atoms by original Motion inherently existing, produced this planetary body. The composition of this planet was for
many ages extremely igneous: still a gradual accumulation of particles emanating from the Sun, ultimately organized it with matter still
more dense than the former planet's composition.
Innumerable ages elapsed before this body became internally and
externally condensed by the chemical action and evolution of elements.  The constant emanations from this body were excessivethe cause of which is obvious. Being composed of denser materials
than the former, and possessing a greater magnitude, its power of action and capacity to receive particles, were greater than those of any
other planet yet existing. Also matter, in its primeval condition, is
incessantly active, conforming to the law of universal gravitation; and
such was the state of this planet primarily.





## p. 173 (#201) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                173
Its igneous composition being very active, in receiving particles
suitable for its association, and in disengaging the non-associating
parts, the planet's emanations produced the nebulous zones or belts
that now surround the primary. These zones (like the planet itselfI
existed for many ages in the form of an igneous atmosphere,,:,
distance from the primary naturally assumed according to the law o!
association and centrifugal force. This evolution of atmosphere from
Saturn was incidentally influenced by the existing forces of the previously formed planets, and the Sun. Thus it produced an active,
agglomerated, atmospheric zone, according to the laws of mutual
association and condensation. And the formation of the first ring
being explained, the second is inferrible as being a corresponding
emanation from thefirst, even as that was from the primary; and it
assumed its relative distance according to existing exterior and internal active influences.  The nebulous rings of Saturn, like the planet
itself, have become condensed near their surface, assuming forms oblately spheroidal.
The centre of Saturn is still an igneous, unstratified substance, the
surface having become chemically condensed by the escape of internal heat, and by the production of organizing and vivifying gases:
and so also are its rings existing, their condition being the same as
would have been produced in any other planet by the same causes
and under the same circumstances.
The surfaces of these rings show many seemingly uneven portions,
an appearance of roughness occasionally contrasting with that of
smoothness and brightness. These appearances are produced by the
reflection of its satellites upon the various parts of these belts during
their revolutions, and by frequent eclipses; also by their own situa
tion, which at times is very unfavorable for proper observation.
At this present moment, those rings may be considered as but just
instituted and developed: and having been formed and condensed
from the different combinations in which they have existed in previous
ages, they will ultimately be resolved into one splhere, by the constant
interchanging of atoms that is now going on, and the chemical influences that are at work universally throughout space. And thus they
will associate with bodies and atoms of like nature and will produce
another planet; while Saturn will constantly, like other bodies, continue to produce and reproduce materials for its own and other compositions.
But as the human organization is extremely fleeting in comparison

to grosser materials, therefore man has not existed long enough to
observe any change in this planet, or in any other.  Centuries after
centuries pass away, and such bodies remain to the vision apparently
unmoved. Yet this very body is ten thousand times more active as
a whole than the body of man; but man, holding dissimilar relations,
and being composed of less durable materials, lives and sinks into
repose before an apparent change takes place in any of the gross
materials existing on the earth. Hence Saturn will change; and
especially its nebulous rings, which will become ultimately organized
into globes, according to the established law of ceaseless action.
This planet, being situated and organized differently from others,
having zones which others have not, and possessing a greater nulnber of satellites than any other planet belonging to the solar system,
has long been the cause Qf much wonder and admiration among scientific observers.  Its diameter being about seventy-nine thousand
miles, greatly exceeds that of the former planet; and this dissimilarity has produced contention against the law of uniformity in general development. Its distance from the sun is more than nine hundred millions of miles.  It revolves upon its axis in a little less than
ten hours and a half. And the period of time occupied in one of
its r!evolutions around the sun, is about thirty years.  The inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic is about two and a half degrees; and
its axis also inclines to the plane of its orbit.  This inclination
causes the light of the sun to strike it vertically for several degrees
either way from its equator; at which place it enjoys twenty-five
thousand days and nights in one of its years; while at the poles,
there is but one of each.  It revolves with the enormous velocity of
twenty-two thousand miles an hour!
The breadth of the first ring from the primary, is twenty thousand
miles. A space occurs between it and the outer, of three thousand
miles.  The breadth of the outer is seven thousand miles; and its
dianmeter is two hundred thousand miles. Being nearly of the same
density of Saturn, the rings revolve also in about ten hours and a
half.
The space existing between the outer ring and the first satellite,
is twenty-nine thousand miles.  The distance from the primary to
its first satellite is over one hundred and seven thousand miles. And
the mean distance from the outer satellite to its primary, is over two
millions of miles. And the five satellites intermediately existing, ob;
serve relative distances and situations from each other, according

to their respective densities and diameters, and therefore may be considered as sustaining positions according to the order observed by
their primary's development.
Thus the computations that have been made in reference to Saturn
and its appendages, only add stronger proof of the law of uniformity
and progressive development, in all bodies belonging to the Solar
System. For first, the planet's diameter, velocity of motion, and
period of revolution, are in exact accordance with this law, as might
be expected from its density and comparative distance friom the Sun.
Secondly, the first ring sustains a distance from the primary corresponding to its magnitude and density: and the second ring holds a
close relation with the first, but only in accordance with its specific
qualities and relative' magnitude. And the diameter of the whole
evidently comprehends four fifths of the original size of the primary,
or its size previous to such annular developments, considering that
its satellites were developed a long period before those rings.  And
the rings now existing afford proof of this, and also of the source of
the materials composing them, seeing that their revolutions correspond (almost) precisely to that of Saturn.  Thirdly, the mean distance occurring between Saturn and its first satellite, and the outer
ring and the same, demonstrates more evidently the relation and connexion that this satellite sustains to its productor and its rings.
And the specific position, distance, and magnitude of each satellite, from the first to the most remote, show a beautiful order and
harmony of arrangement. And the density, magnitude, and velocity
of the outer satellite, with its orbitual inclination and rotary motion,
harmonize precisely with the primary. It holds its relations in a
minute and specific manner, yet in all these it corresponds to the
magnitude and all the motions of the primary. For the revolution
of tile outer sphere, and its density, magnitude, and situation, bear
the same relation to each other as do the same things in Saturn
itself-the same established causes operating on each body according
to its relation to its primary.
Therefore Saturn, its rings and satellites, present one system of
progressive development, when considered in a general point of view,
But incidental causes, producing like effects, tend in some degree to
present an appearance contrary to the uniformity of the whole. But
on investigating the universal motions and developments of this planet,
the thought of such irregularities will at once be banished from  the
mind.

Human conceptions of order are founded upon the supposed
reality of apparent confusion; and when apparent confusion and
irregularities are observed, the mind instantly conceives of their opposite order. Hence if coifusion were not apparent, the word order
would be without meaning. But where order universally exists, and
confusion is temporarily and minutely apparent to the mind, there the
general conception of order, would be evidently correct; as it would
be derived from contrasting the order of a general, with the disorder
of an incidental character.  Therefore if order is apparently universal, this at once establishes the doctrine of unfor7nity; and all particular and apparent confusion must be referred to incidental and
local causes.  But the great Whole being correctly comprehended,
presents a system of undisturbed order and harmony!
Thus I leave this most wonderful planet to the discussion of
researchers and mathematical observers, and commence revealing
the most wonderful developments that it has produced. And a
proper conception of truths and facts as pertaining to this carth,
will by analogy, carry an inference favorable to the truthfulness of
the present revealment in reference to this heavenly body.
~ 20. The geography of this planet is very beautiful, it being
divided into two thirds water and one third earth. And being
entirely free from all volcanic and catastrophic occurrences, it presents an even and undisturbed surface.  There are but few prominences, and these are near the poles; the equator being perfectly
free from these, with the exception of a few promontories, connecting themselves with still higher land, whose dividing chasm forms
the bed of a very extensive body of water.  These prominences
were formed by the natural developments of the materials in motion
during the planet's primary and subsequent conditions.
Concerning the vegetable and organic formations of this planet,
much might be said in an abstract dissertation.  Still, the strict history of these creations could not possibly be given minutely; and
even if this were possible, it would not be useful.
Organic beings inhabited this planet many thousand years before
this earth had an existence.  Therefore, according to the law of
progressive refinement, the organic kingdoms of this planet have
attained to a high degree of perfection.
There are four general classes of vegetable developments here
existing. One class assumes high and bulky forms, but it is pro

duced only near the poles, where exist the minimum amount of light
and heat.  These do not exist near the equator, nor in the vicinity
of water. They are gigantic vegetable developments in the form of
trees; but the kinds of materials composing them are not to be found
in any higher order of vegetable formation.
The second class has a smooth, slim body, and the branches in
length are twice that of the body; and they cast a deep shade.
They are in app]~earance similar to the Ul)as, but not in quality or
composition. These bring forth delicious fruit, which is long in
shape, internally white, and encompassed with a thick, external
coating.  The branches that first eject themselves from the body are
several feet from the earth, but not quite so high as it is from these to
the top.  This class should be understood as the second in the order
of formation-as the ultimate and perfection of the former Class.
The third in order presents itself as a more perfect vegetable.
This rises but a few feet above the surface of the ground.  It has
several descending boughs, which when developed act as new bodies.
by fastening themselves as roots in the earth.  This vegetable is;
much complicated in its parts.  Its location is near the equator, and.
to this fact its peculiarity may be attributed.  This brings forth ai
kind of pulse-fruit.  Being exceedingly nourishing, it enters veryfrequently into the composition of animal forms.
Thefourth vegetable formation is the last developed and most perfect.  Being, a succeeding development of all beneath it, its compo,sition is much more perfect than that of others.  Therefore it stands
as an ultimate of the vegetable kingdom, comprehending the essences
of all below its high order of being.  Its roots and trunk are very
long and slender, and it develops from the bottom of the trunk to the,
shooting forth of the branches, calices corresponding to the petals of
the bud and its fruit.  It is not high, but grows with exceeding
spontaneity; and it is fitted for the uses of the animal economy.  It
is produced in one half of one of the yrears, at the equator-reproduced twice in one of this planet's years.  And this is the mostuseful vegetable upon the surface of Saturn.
There are intermediate formations, from the lowest to the highest,.
in the vegetable kingdom.  But it would be impossible to classify
these intermediate species and the four generalizations give a distinct
conception of the vegetable developments of this planet; the object;
being only to establish progressive succession. And this being founded,
in natural and invariable laws, analogzy confirms tliis revealmetr..

There are five general classes of animal existences on this planet,
Polygastric monads are existing in various forms, from the articulata
to the vertebrata.  There is not existing any particular species of
semi-vertebrated animals.  There are but few articulated; but the
general animal. existences of this planet are entirely vertebrated.
Reptiles, saurians, &c., do not exist upon its surface, the cause of
which is that the materials composing this body are of too high and.are a nature to enter into the composition of any gross forms or
)rganizations.
Thefirst of the five classes, therefore, is of a well-organized form,
S1aving very fine vascular and muscular tissues.  This animal, being
one of the general classes, requires a brief description.  It is very
{arge and very strong, having joints only in its hind legs.  Its fore
legs, being composed of a very strong muscular and osseous substance, are elastic and pliable when occasion requires, but exceedingly strong and immovable whenever operated upon by its positive
wvill.  Its length is proportionate to its height.  Being an animal of
exceeding power, it is the most useful of any others to its governors.
Its eyes are small; its ears are narrow and short; its head is wide
and higllh; its proboscis and mouth are closely connected, the former
serving as a nasal organ and a useful instrument for drinking, and
transferring to the mouth the long, hard-shelled fruit that exists upon
the complex vegetable form which has been described.  Its disposition is firm, and yet it is submissive.  It has exterior developments
1corresponding to its disposition and natural attachments.  Its head
being wide, gives it an inclination for self-protection and preservation, insomuch that it constructs large caves and places of concealment in whlich it resides during the long night that is experienced at
the pole.  And during the long day that is also experienced at the.same location, it leaves its place of repose and perigrinates near the
shores of the water, and to places where grows more luxuriantly the
fruit upon which it subsists. *
The sccond in order, is an animal of much less complicated fi)rmaftion.  Its form is not so graceful and pleasing as the former, but its
composition is a degree more perfect.  It consociates with the former
animal, exists in the same region, but is extremely amphibious,
*The speaker here remarked that this and other animals were designated by the;inhabitants uf this planet by particular sounds; but as it would be difficult, as well
as useless, tt represent these sounds to an inhabitant of the earth, he would not make
the attempt.

insomuch that in this particular point it is very dissimilar to the other.
Its disposition is of an irritable and excitable nature.  Its muscular
and vascular system being very active, causes a great amount of nervous activity and irritability.  This is caused by its peculiar shape,
and the circumstances under which it exists. In form, it typifies
Saurian species-but in this particular only.
The third in order, is composed of still finer materials, and its
power and celerity of muscular motion are not equalled by any other
species existing.  It has four legs or extremities; the hinder ones
representing slightly the human foot, and the foremost typifying the
limbs of the seal.  Still these are perfectly adapted to the situation in
which the animal exists.  Its flesh is very tender in comparison to
that of the former, and its skin would be impenetrable by any instruments that are on earth known.  It is of an osseous structure, composed chiefly of the harder materials of its bone, forming a surface
like a complex network of scales; and it is therefore impenetrable,
from  its smooth and elastic surface.  Its length and height correspoid to those of an animal that previously existed upon this globe;*
yet its disposition and phrenic attributes are very dissimilar to this
species. Having great strength, it moves with great rapidity. Though
master, by its subduing power, over all below its degree of being, it
still manifests no disturbing, destructive, or antagonistic disposition.
Having peculiar associations, its nature corresponds thereunto.  Its
main feature is a repulsive and tyrannical appearance, the real indication of which is firmness, power, and activity.
The fourth in order, is a form slightly typical of the natural man.
Its composition being a progression of all below it, it exists as a distinct species, occupying the station becoming its dignity and superior
nature.  It has four limbs, two of which serve as organs of motion
and navigation, and the others are rather armns than limbs like the
former.  It is more highly vertebrated, and has greater elasticity of
muscles, than those below it.  Its body is rather wide, and not perfectly round. The sacral bone and hips being much distended, gives
it great strength and muscular power.  Its shoulders being high, and
its neck corresponding, give it great elasticity in the movements of its
trunk.
Its mental organization nearly represents that of the human being,
with the exception that its knowledge and power of exterior under* The lecturer incidentally remarked that the animal referred to was the Iguanodoa,
which this animal nearly resembles in species.

standing, surpasses that of man existing on the earth! Its head being
round and long, still bearing the general shape of the human head,
gives it a more. extensive scope of mental comprehension than man
on earth possesses. Its general disposition is characterized by strong
attachments and social desires. It has great power of concentration;
and its sense of what is naturally right and just, is very prominent.
Its head being not very high in proportion to its size, causes an absence of veneration for the invisible; but it venerates things and
truths well known and well attested by the evidence of its senses.
Hence it deduces its convictions from  all it sees, and venerates
according to the nature of the deductions or visible truths presented.
It has a strong passion for mirth and pleasurable emotions, insomuch
that its communications are more subtle at times when this desire
has been excited, than any communications of man. It has a powerfully retentive memory or susceptibility of repetitions of previous impressions.  It has strong intellectual faculties, insomuch that it
governs other beings below it by its mechanical ingenuity.  It is, in
general terms, a most perfect animal-intellectual being.
But its mental and physical organizations are so constructed that
the individualization of the inner life could not occur; and its natural
and exterior experience are but instinct to man there existing.  And
the intuition and powers of perception with which it is endowed, are
no more to the sweeping intellect of the hunman inhabitants of that
planet, than is the knowledge of the orang-outang on this earth existing, to Man, who is governor of all below his exalted state of organization!
~ 21. The following class in order, of animal organization, is the
ultimate of this planet, and the perfection of all below it; and this
class is MAN. His form is perfected in its developments and adaptations to its uses. His limbs are very straight and round. His joints
and their appendages are composed of fine materials, and display izn
their perfect adaptation, original design. The body is of perfect form,
and is characterized by a symmetry unequalled in any other being
there existing. The sternum is oval and full, joining the costals with
a kind of bracework, which gives full space and free action to the
viscera system. The lungs, which are divided into two hemispheres,
are composed of an adipose and elastic, active substance. The heart
has also two divisions, and observes movements which correspond
with those of the lungs.  The ganglionic system  is very freely dis

seminated throughout every part of the body, almost giving imperceptible motion to the motar nerves of the organs.
The head corresponds in its perfection to the body. The cranium
not being composed of a heavy, thick substance, gives great activity
to the senses in respect to external objects.  The cerebrurrnis very
large and full; and the cerebellum and its divisions are still larger.
The restiform, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis, are composed
of substances so sensitive (corresponding to the substance of the brain),
that the whole forms a perfect system of motion and sensation. The
brain being excessively active, sends throughout the nervous system
a refined ether of sensation. The brain is composed of innumerable
cortical glands, each of which attracts and repels, performing systolic
and diastoli)motions.  These cortical glands are the reservoirs from
which proceed the fibres and nerves of sensation; for these glands
conceive and produce them.  Thus the nerves of sensation are connected with the corcula of the brain, as the arteries and veins are
connected with the ventricles of the heart.  Therefore contraction
and expansion of these cortical glands produce the involuntary motions of the system;'hile by the same forces, the heart presses the
blood throughout the body.  The motions of the lungs and heart are
very powerful.  The motion of the brain corresponds to that of these
organs, and the motion of the whole corresponds to the gigantic
strength of the body.
The form of the system has great beauty.  The surface, corresponding to the materials composing the whole system, is very fine,
and almost transparent.  The main motions of the system correspond
to those of the human body upon this planet, with the exception that
they are characterized by more precision, and are governed by more
decided judgment, which also controls their actions universally. Their
organization is of the most perfect kind, both mental and physical;
and their intellect being expansive and powerful, judgment controls
them entirely, insomuch that weakness and disease are not existing
among them.
The prominent qualities of the mind are of a moral and intellectual
nature. They have strong social attachments, but these are governed
strictly by a well-organized intellect. Their force of character is extremely great, this also being under the guidance of well-directed
reason. They are firm in will, generally submissive, and are free
from all superfluous dispositions. Veneration in them is very deep
and impressive.  Nothing, however, is revered but that which the

judgment responds to as being true.  Their causality is not so fully
developed as comparison or the power of analogical reasoning. Perception is extremely vivid and penetrating.
Their heads are very high and long. Power of generalization and
synthetical investigation, is in them almost unbounded.  They reason
from the internal-receiving truth through the highly-sanctioned convictions of their interior principles.  Their physical organization
being so perfect, admits their principles or beginnin!,' Caulses(* to
extend throughout the body, and makes them very susceptible to
impressions.
They are governed strictly by the laws of their nature. Sensation
exists, and the laws and uses of this they understand.  From sensation arise inclinations.  Sensation being a law of theprganization,
exists upon the fibres and nervous system with them, the same as
with man on earth.  The inclinations which it produces are either
attractive or repulsive, and they are governed in respect to such
strictly by the interior impressions received concerning them.
They reason inductively: and from effects and forms external,
they induce an original principle, and then reason from principles to
their effects.  Subjects are thus comprehended by one grasp of their
mighty intellects.
With a telescopic mind they familiarize themselves with earths existing between them and the Sun, and also with the inhabitants upon
them existing. They contemplate the planets of space with no more
curiosity than we do those of the Solar System.  Their minds being
free from imperfection —firom all that is opposed to righteousness, they
associate with that which is pure and good.  They connect their minds
with first principles, and with the internal of all things.  Their minds
are endowed with powers so penetrating that they perceive all things
in a general light, and as being good.  They are unlike the class
mentioned before them, which reason from externals only; which
deduce from things seen their knowledge and judgment, knowing
nothing of the internal, and receiving no response from the influx of
interior principles.  But man, as superior to these, has knowledge
derived from internal experience and consciousness, and from this
only. They follow inclinations, if they are approbated by their interiors; but if they are disapproved, they repel them by the exercise of
a superior judgment: and thus they are free from violation and disease.
* That is, the interior essence of man as the prior cause of the exterior form, with
all its manifestations.

The perfection of their internal principle far exceeds that of any
class of human beings in our Solar System.  T/hey associate with
the knzoulcdge of the second Sphere!  They receive no impressions
but those which flow from internal realities.  They are physically,
mentally, and morally perfected.
They inhabit buildings of an ingenious and peculiar structure,
which are also beautiful and convenient.  These are very large and
extensive, covering immense areas of land, like an extensive city
among us.  There are, however, but few of these large and united
buildings upon the surface of the planet, these being near the equator, where light and heat, which correspond to interior truth and love,
are most perfectly enjoyed.
They form associations according to inticrnal desire.  They are
not governed by the inclinations of the natural man, and therefore
take unto themselves mates according to mutual inzwZard approbation,
and thus they are united in the bonds of spiritual happiness and
peace.  There is no repulsion ever existing between associated
mates, because love and purity abide with them universally.
Their minds are sufficiently expansive to comprehend at a single
glance, the whole surface of their country.  Hence they are conscious of the movements of the whole nation. All are united as one
brotherhood, harmonizing in all their interests, though existing in
different locations on the planet.  Undisturbed connexion exists
between nation and nation; and that which constitutes the interest of
one, constitutes the undivided interest and peace of the whole race.
This is perceived by internal reasoning; and this state of things is
sustained by the approval of their interior principles.  Such are the
inhabitants of Saturn; and thus are purity and goodness manifested
as the result of their perfected knowledge and highly unfolded
mental powers.
It is only by means of the five generalizations made upon the aninlals of Saturn, that these could be understood; because there are
existing innumerable species of animals on this planet.  The anirnals inferior to man are in nature rodentia, with the exception of the
first, which is ruminating in its habits.  Millions of intermediate
beings exist, and have existed, between these general classes.  But
by arranging them into the order of progressive ascension from the
lowest to the highest, each assuming a form according to its approx

imation to man, the mind obtains a general conception of the animal
productions of this planet.
~ 2Q. The next planet evolved from the Sun was the fifth in the
Solar System, and is named JUPITER. The Sun at this time, including its atmospheric emanation, extended to the orbit observed by
Jupiter in its revolution.  By virtue of inherent, and active energies
still existing in the igneous composition of the Sun,-and of the
powerful motions which it and every particle that composed it had,
the fifth planet was called into existence according to laws originally
and eternally established.
Laws and motions as heretofore explained, will be viewed in a
general light by observers and investigators who are searching for the
causes or living principles which govern all matter.  Therefore, understanding the motions that produced former formations, nothing
needs here to be added in reference to the same law, as producing
this planet.  By a constant association and agglomeration of atoms
and particles repulsed from the great Mlass, and seeking association
among the combinations that had been thus formed, the accumulation at length became qualified to assume specific motions, and a
spherical form, the magnitude of which, including its atmospheric
emanations, extended to the orbit of its farthest satellite.
Such was tile original condition of Jupiter. According to the
laws of evaporation, gravitation, and consolidation, the planet gradually assumed the form and bulk which it now has.  Particles perpetually emanating from this, became associated in other and smaller
combinations, and condensation of these produced its satellites; each
of whichi sustained a position corresponding to its relation to the
planet and to the other satellites, and according to its magnitude and
density.
The materials composing Jupiter and its satellites were more dense
than former planetary productions.  The materials composing the
Sun had become condensed according to the number of planets
which had been evolved from its original composition.  Therefore
this planet's materials were denser than the former, as corresponding
to the increased density of the materials of the Sun.  The whole
was an agglomeration of igneous atoms: but following the laws originally instituted, it became gradually consolidated.  Still, innumerable ages elapsed before the present condition was attained.
The present density of this planet is one and a quarter to that of

water showing an increase of density from  the other planets.  Its
distance from the Sun is at this time four hundred and ninety millions of miles.  Its diameter is eighty-nine thousand miles.  It revolves upon its axis once in nearly ten hours, and around the great
Sun, in nearly twelve years.  It travels therefore with great velocity.
The nearer planets approach the great Centre from which they emanated, the greater is the velocity of their motion in their orbits.
The inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is very imperceptible.  In consequence of its unimaginable velocity of rotary
motion, it is somewhat flattened at its poles and full at its equator.
Owing to the inclination of its axis to the plane of its orbit being
very slight, the sun strikes it vertically unceasingly at its equator, at
which place there is but little variety in the seasons or changes in the
length of its days and nights.
This planet having four satellites which are three less than the
number of Saturn's, possesses as a consequence greater bulk and
magnitude.  It is fourteen hundred times greater in bulk than the
earth, and contains nearly three hundred times the amount of matter.
This planet also, being the largest in our solar system, would seem
at a superficial view to refute the doctrine of uniformity and progression.  The causes which were brought to operate upon the accumulation of particles composing this planet, were very dissimilar to
those that acted upon Saturn.  There was a tendency of associated
particles to adhere more closely in this planet than in the former,
because they possessed greater density and stronger mutual affinities.
If this had not been so, particles would have emanated from the mass
to produce another satellite.  But this cause, together with the conjoined forces that existed in the Sun and the other planets, prevented
the farther development of its particles.  These were incidental
causes, and acted upon the body merely because it was placed under
different circumstances from those attending any other planet before
or since created.  In all its general conditions it manifests a general
uniformity with all other planetary developments: but in this and
one other particular, it apparently contradicts the great law established.  Yet understanding that all such discrepancies owe their existence to foreirgn and incidental causes (these being mere negaltions
of the great general and eternal law), they may properly be considered as not refitting, but as absolutely confirming the original and
universal principles and forces as emanating from the great Vortex or
throne of infinite Power.

The mean distance of the first satellite from  the primary is two
hundred and sixty-six thousand miles; and its period of revolution
is one day and eighteen hours.  This body is more dense than the
succeeding ones; therefore it sustains a position  nearest to its
primary.
The second satellite exists four hundred and twenty thousand
miles firom  its primary.  Its period of revolution is three days and
a half: presenting an increase of distance, period, and rarity of
particles.'rhe thlird satellite is supposed to be the largest one belonging to
this planet.  This supposition is founded upon the observations
made by its discoverer, whose instrument was not so much perfected
as those which are now in use.  It is the largest satellite, but the
calculations in reference to its magnitude will hereafter be found to
be incorrect.  The mean distance of this satellite from its primary is
six hundred and seventy thousand miles; and its period of revolution is seven days.  And here again is seen a perpetual ascension of
accumulated particles, in distance, rotation, and rarity.
The fourth and last satellite is over one million of miles from its
productor, and revolves in sixteen days and a half. *
Steadily therefore is demonstrated the great truth of uniform ascension from the lowest to the highest; the highest being the ultimate of
the lowest, and each particle sustaining a position according to its specific quality and magnitude,-their mutual association being called
g'dac itlzonz.
Thus was produced, and thus exists, the fifth Planet and its appendages, as evolved from the immense Sun which is yet an inexhaustible source of heat and light to the evanescent forms that exist upon
its planets' surfaces. And had the same circumstances been existing
in respect to this planet, as were in respect to Saturn and its offspring, the same effect and form would have been manifested. But
as these circumstances were incidenltal as connected with the former
planet, so were those also which determined the peculiarities of the
latter.  The modifying influences acting upon them being exceedingly
dissimilar (which dissimilarity is always a characteristic of that which
is not general and to be depended upon), these caused a corresponding difference in the developments of these planets.
* In speaking of the distances, magnitudes, periods, &c., of the planets and their
satellites, the author merely uses proxinate numbers, without descending to numerical
niceties.

Thus the generlalization of this planet, in respect to its magnitude
density, motions, and appendages, leads to further confirmation of
the established principle of uniformity and harmony, throughout the
realrns of undefinable space.  And what has been said respecting
other planets, being in accordance with well-attested and admitted
truths, precludes the necessity of further discussion to prove the undeniable fact of this planet's relation to those that were previously
developed.
Leaving, therefore, intermediate considerations for the work of scientific researches (which considerations can not have any possible
bearing upon the mnain )rincitples established), I commence giving a
general description of the vegetable and animal forms abounding upon
the surface of Jupiter. By abstract dissertations upon these, the mind
may be led to conceive of important truths by analogy; and the application of these truths will be of incalculable value in promoting the
happiness and peace of the inhabitants of the earth.  And that such
application will be made, is by no means improbable.  And when
these things are impressed upon the internal principle of man, man
xvill become generally enlightened; and an extensive knowledge of
things existing, will unite his affections to Truth. And in proportion

upon its surface, a detailed description is not necessary to be given.
But a genleral classification will be made of the prominent kinds existing,, in order that the perpetual ascension may be conceived of as
here preserved in order and harmony.
There are on this planet upward of three hundred thousand species
of plants.  But their connexions with each other are so intimate, that
they warrant but five general classifications.
The first of these is an exceedingly large and bulky tree, whose
circumference varies in size according to the circumstances under
which it is produced. It is formed of the compositions existing in
the planet's materials; and being the strongest production of the
vegetable kingdom, it is consequently the most imperfect.  It has
heavy seams formed of complex fibres, which are fully developed
about the branches in thin ejected limbs, upon which exists a species of fruit.  This fruit is of a nature suitable to enter into the com

position of the lower order of animals, but is exceedingly deleterious
to the higher classes.
The second species of plant differs froln the other in height, bulk,
and general appearance. It is encompassed with a thick bark. The
productions of this tree are limited.  It brings forth a kind of juice
which flows freely from the cups existing upon its exterior. This
is useful, as it is very nourishing and invigorating to the animal
economy.
The third class of plants slightly typifies the Wheat, — and is
more homogeneous with the constitution of the higher orders of
animals.
The fourth class approximates still nearer to animal existence.
Being more perfect in composition than the others, it presents a variegated foliage, the extracts from which enter essentially into the
forms of the first animals.
The ffth class, being an ultimate of the four others described, is
necessarily more exalted in composition.  This species is a kind of
zoophyte,-which may be considered as mediator between vegetable
and animal existences. For while it sustains a close connexion with
the former kingdom, it throws feelers of sensation into the latter; and
thus it partakes of both vegetable and animal life.
The ANIMAL developnients of Jupiter, are a degree less perfect
than those of Saturn.  There are a great many species of animals
here existing, though these are not quite so generally disseminated as
the species in the vegetable kingdom. These will admit of only four
general classifications.
The first of these is in nature both rodentia and ru minating.  In
size and stature it corresponds-to the animal first described as existing in Saturn; but in disposition and habits, it is greatly dissimilar.
Upon the surface of this planet there are many convolutions, it having more roughness than the former.  And this is manifest about the
equator more than at the poles.  The igneous substance primarily
existing in the interior of the planet, was incidentally acted upon by
expanding elements, the result of which was some volcanic and catastrophic occurrences.  And these have developed mountains, - about
which may be found the species of animals above mentioned.
The next in order is in nature nearly digitigrade.  This sustains
a position in the order of development a little above the former class.
Its form corresponds nearly to that of the seal.  It has limbs in a

different location, and moves with great rapidity both on land and in
water, it being also amphibious. Its disposition is secretive, retiring,
and apparently submissive. It is extremely tyrannical over other
animals within its power.
The animal following this is of a still higher and more perfect order.  Its size corresponds to that of the natural man, and it is composed of more active materials than the former animals. Its strength
is almost incredible; but being characterized by an ingenious and
retiring disposition, it is very active and forcible only when occasion
requires.  This animal approximates to Man, —being the one that
constitutes the connecting link between the animal and human organization. Its disposition is, in general terms, combative, secretive, and
ingenious; and these qualities being accompanied by great self-will
and firmness, it hence possesses wonderful force and energy.  It
possesses quick and intuitive perceptions, and a retentive memory;
and its affections are as pure as the form would indicate. Being thus
mentally organized, it associates with all things that are agreeable to
its inclination, this inclination being always qualified by its sense of
refinement. And inasmuch as its mind is a result of its organization,
it is governed by its natural instincts; and of these its habits are the
result.  It reasons from that which is seen; and this reason is not
such properly, but rather inclination produced by foreign substances
acting upon the sensation of the body.  Therefore this animal exists
one degree below man on Earth.
~ 24. Concerning the HUMAN INHABITANTS of Jupiter, much mighllt
be said that would be of interest; for their relation to our C0onCCptio107
of a perfect being is much closer than the inhabitants of Saturn.
Their form is full, and well sustained by inward and physical forces.
Their size, symmetry, and beauty of form, exceed those of the eattll's
inhabitants.  Their mental organization corresponds to their physical
developments.  Smoothness and evenness are apparent upon their
form generally.
They do not walk erect, but assume an inclined position, frequently
using their hands and arms in walking, the lower extremities being
rather shorter than the arms according to our standard of proportion.
And by a modest desire to be seen only in an inclined position, they
have formed this habit, which has become an established custom
among them.
Their general characteristics are of a mechanical and intellectual

nature, accompanied by strong affections and interior love for each
other. They have great moral developments; are submissive, and
yet firm and decided in all their intentions and dealings with each
other.  Their intelligence greatly excels that of Earth's inhabitants.
They are existing in a state intermediate between the first and second
Spheres, in knowledge and refinement.
Their form of countenance displays the qualities and workings of
their inward principle. There is a peculiar prominence of the upper
lip, this consisting of a complex and interwoven mass of fibres, the
action of which gives great expression to inward thoughts and feelinos; which expression among them  constitutes the peculiar mode
of conversation.  Therefore they can not think one thing and
speak another; for their expression would betray their inward sentiments.
There is a great deal of gentleness and amiability manifested
through  their exteriors: and inasmuch as the external form corresponds to the inward principle, all their external communications
with each other are inflowings of interior affection. And as they are
highly susceptible to universal love, they are incessantly expressing
this by the congenial radiations of their expressive countenances.
They reason inductively. They associate with the internal of all
things, as being the only real reality in the Universe.  Their associations with each other are according to the inward affinity of spheres,
— and thus are they governed in all their conjugal and national relations.  For by an influx of inward desire from one to another, wlich
is perfectly spiritual, they become attached: and thus conjoined, they
exist in perfect unity, by virtue of their perfect interior natures.
Knowinog these indestructible truths, and knowinrg all things which,are unchanging, they submit unresistingly to be controlled exclusivel])thereby.  Hence they observe great care in producing, and in preserving the health of,'their offspring.  tHealth being thus indelibly
enstamped upon their constitutions while young, strengthens in their
growth, and they become enlightened in the perfect knowledge of
these principles.  Therefore disease is not known among them; and
being free from this imperfection enables them to generate excessively fast.
Their constitutions being composed of light and changing particles,
they soon change their form of existence.  They do not die, but
rather sink into repose by an expansion of their interiors which seek
more agreeable spheres.  And regarding this as a mere metamor

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 191
phosis, they escape with transports of delight; and they are hence
pleased with the evanescent existence of the body.
Moreover the inhabitants of this planet look upon the changes and
vicissitudes of their physical being, as natural and inevitable consequences of existing causes.  These vicissitudes ae but few; but in
proportion to the refinement of particles composing their body, is the
brevity of their existence.  For that which is fine and delicate exists but a little while in any form; but that which is heavy and
imperfect, continues in the form longer in consequence of being less
active and less susceptible to foreign action.  And as the inhabititants of Jupiter are composed of finer elements than those composing the inhabitants of the earth, they remain in the form but a short
period, by reason of its active and changeable composition.  Thirty
years is the average duration of their form's existence.
Having an expansive and sweeping intellect, they comprehend the
laws and relations of their being with one concentrated thought.
And meditation in them is thrown out upon their countenances with
a sweet expression, which would, if it could be seen by an inhabitant
of Earth, bring forth an ejection of tears and a gush of feeling that
could not be expressed.  Their mode of conversation is thus distinctly and unequivocally expressive; for it is a mode of expressing
the impressions existing upon their interiors.  And these beam forth
with such perfect brightness and affection, that they are responded to
by the interior affections of every other being.  It being absolutely
impossible for them to think one thing and speak another; to have a
greater amount of self-love than universal affection; to think impurely, or conceive unrighteous thoughts; and being thus free from
all the imperfections of this and other earths, their exteriors are open
to the reception of light and truth, which correspond to the fire of
spiritual purification.
They inhabit well-constructed edifices, whose form corresponds to
that of a tent, rather than a house, on Earth.  These are lined with
a bluish bark, taken from a tree of the second class; and they are
thus rendered impervious to cold, water, and light.  They receive
one twenty-fifth of the light of the Sun that the earth enjoys.  But
this, striking vertically at the equator, at which place is located their
extensive habitations, gives them the enjoyment of as much light as
could be possibly obtained from the Centre of our Solar System.
They are divided into families, associations, and nations.  Their
families are composed of such individuals as have a desire for the

192             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
company of each other from  a congeniality of interior affection.
Families grow into associations, and these into nations: and the
whole forms one perfect, harmonious, sI)iritual brotherhood!
The cause of this state of things is the intelligence which exists
among them; an4 this, transcending the erudition of the inhabitants
of Earth to an infinite extent, enables them to comprehend the uses
of all things, and their original adaptations.  Therefore they make
proper application of these uses; the result of which is their glorious purification. And as they are surrounded by various vegetables, birds, and animals, they are also capable of making a proper
application of these, to promote their greatest happiness and peace.
They reason so perfectly by induction and from correspondences,
that whatsoever may be the specific quality of their affections and delights, these are all ultimately centred in tile proper comprehension
of all that is connected with their state of mental association.  And
all affections that are breathed forth from their interiors, are so charm-d
ingly typified upon their exteriors, and even the representation itself
is such an emblem of love and purity, that an unspeakable appreciation of their mutual interior affections is reciprocally established in
their minds!
Thus is the physical and mental, or natural and spiritual man,
made perfect. And by conceiving of the indestructible relation
which exists between purity and truth, the minds of the inhabitants
of the Earth will be led to recognise their institutions, and to spurn
with the utmost abhorrence all things that are opposed to righteousness. Thus efforts will be made to bring about a better state of
things; and this will be the unfolding of interior truths and principles that are at this moment considered as imaginary and chimerical.
And by properly conceiving of the celestial peace and purity that
flow spontaneously from  interior truths, the minds of the Earth will
become relieved from their external bonds of corruption, into the
inexpressible light and liberty of celestial love and peace!
Concerning Jupiter's spiritual inhabitants, I will hereafter speak,
when the knowledge is given me by spiritual influx from the sixthl
Spthere.  But for the present, I leave this planet, which is aboundingr
with all that attaches the affections and feelings of man, as the objects of his deepest yearnings, while aspiring to higher states of
purity and peace.  And man's desires for celestial magnificence, are
the spontaneous breathings of his interior principle.  And his aspirations and anticipations can not be too exalted: for lie may rest

ass/red from the evidences now presented, that his anticipations are
scarcely as a single thought in comparison to the destined future expansion of his interiors, and to the celestial light, peace, and magnificence, that await not only the spiritual composition of mankind, but
every particle existing in infinite space!
~ 25. Approaching nearer to the sun, the plan of uniformity is
apparently confused, by the appearance of four spheroidal bodies.
These have been the cause of many speculations'and hypotheses as
to their origin, and probable termination. As they have been discovered within the present century, there is as yet no established
and uniform opinion respecting them. They exist between Jupiter
and Mars; and are very similar in their orbits and revolutions around
the sun.
Concerning the diameters and specific constitution of these bodies
little needs to be said. But a general history of their origin and formation would satisfy inquiring minds, and also lead to a proper comprehension of their relations to each other, and to the planets between
which they exist.
Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, are the names applied to these.
bodies. And the fact that their orbits are exceedingly elliptic and;
constantly intersecting the planes of each other, has suggested the.
hypothesis that they were formed from a cornet which appeared in the'
year 1770; and the disappearance of which was so very mysterious
that no other conclusion than the above could possibly be conceived
of, as accounting for this singular phenomenon.  And more conclusive was this thought to be, when it was discovered that two of them,
had each a luminous atmosphere, rather dense and changing.  Aind
this is still supposed by some to be the remnant of the luminous.

It is known also that comets are from forty months to five uiluldrti;

years in accomplishing their revolutions around the Sun. They
move with increased velocity as they approach the Sun. But the
calculations that are made in reference to the speed of these bodies
are not to be depended on. For these calculations are founded on
an angle formed by the apparent positions assumed by such bodies
and the Sun. Presuming that these appearances vary but little from
time to time in their relations to the reality, and not considering the
refractions of light, involves an oversight which makes the above
calculations exceedingly dubious, as have also been the calculations
with reference to the speed of light. But by understanding that
comets travel with a velocity in proportion to their density and magnitude, and by observing the appearance of one of these bodies,
calculations may be made in reference to its re-appearance, inasmuch
as they are not known to change their orbits, or to be any more
eccentric in their motions than any other planet, supposing the latter
to be operated upon by the same influences that are brought to act
iapon these luminous and igneous bodies.
Comets therefore are constituted of unstratified particles, an ultimate of the Solar System; and they are governed by the same un-:hanging laws of gravitation or association that control every atom in
space.
In contemplating the asteroids and inquiring for their origin, the
plan that was first instituted in all planetary developments should be
distinctly borne in mind. And considering the magnitude of Jupiter;and Mars, and the combined magnitudes of these asteroids, there'will at once be seen the relation existing between those planets and
these smaller bodies that are between them: for the diameters of
these bodies united, would conform to the law of successive development.
Their specific diameters have not as yet been determined. Their
Nrotations have been scarcely decided upon, but their revolutions have:been nearly correctly calculated. They are supposed to vary in their
diameters from eighty to two thousand miles. And the first exists
two hundred and twenty-five millions of miles from the sun, and the
4ast one, two hundred and sixty-six millions. The others sustain
intermediate distances.  The first revolves around its primary in.about three years and eight months, the second in about four years
and four months, and the last two in about four years and seven
imonths.  And astronomical calculations in reference to their periods
of revolution have been very correct; but the calculations respecting





## p. 195 (#223) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               195
their magnitudes will be found to differ greatly from the calculations
that are now being instituted, when the latter shall be made known
to the world.
Their density increases from that of Jupiter, being more than two
to that of water.  Therefore they are constituted of heavier materials than previously formed planets. And they are exceedingly
elliptic: an effect produced by their density and relation to each
other.
Concerning their origin I will now speak. The atmospheric emnanation of the Sun extended beyond the orbit occupied by Mars, its
termination being at the orbit now occupied by Pallas. And according to principles previously established, the association of particles
produced an agglomerated igneous mass of matter.  The density of
this composition, being greater than that of any other body, prevented
it from ascending to a higher station. This accumulation of atoms
would, if properly condensed like other planets, have been of less
magnitude than Jupiter, and exceeding that of Mars; corresponding
to the magnitude of the present bodies as combined.
Inasmuch as there was not a perfect association of interior materials, great convulsions were constantly going on throughout its composition.  Interior heat being excessive, evaporation could not take
place with sufficient rapidity to give perfect relief to the expanding
elements.  Nor could elements chemically associate; nor could
unity exist in the partly stratified exterior.  But being internally disunited, and the whole mass being not as yet perfectly under the influence of attraction and repulsion, or the emanations evolved from the
Sun,-the whole, by an incomprehensible expansion of interior elements, was throvwn asunder!
Association of particles being a spontaneous result of this disorganization, they became what they now are, four asteroids.  And be;ng
almost instantly brought under the direct influence of Jupiter and
Afars, which had then nearly assumed their present forms, they
were thus made to assume a uniformity of motion, which motion existed in the primary body in which they had previously existed.
The one being more dense than the other, and the whole being denser
than Jupiter, prevented any nearer approach toward that planet than
they now manifest. And foreign causes also modified somewhat
their movements and revolutions.  Therefore the orbit of Pallas in-:clines most to the ecliptic, this body being the one sustaining the

highest position, and the one also whose poles are much flattened,
and equator greatly bulged.
This, therefore, is the origin of these asteroids. Combined they
produce one planet; which may and will be confirmed by astronomical researchers, who are at liberty to test the truth or falsity of this
revealment.
As they have not developed anything beyond the vegetable kingdom (although an era is now approaching that will call into existence
a class of zoophytes), an examination of their exteriors would be unnecessary and of no useful application. And these facts being now
impressed, I proceed to speak in reference to their kindred planet,
which was developed soon after their inconceivable disorganization.
And the only thought concerning these asteroids that may be made
useful in application to the inhabitants of the earth is, that they manifest the natural result of interior elements that are discordant and
opposed to each other. For being disunited, they became confused;
and they are now reckoned as the least among the planets in our Solar System. And the same is true of the disunited materials existing
among the inhabitants of the earth: for inasmuch as order and harmony are the natural results of perfectly associated principles, —so
are disorder and confusion the natural results of the commingling of
opposite and antagonistic principles and elements. And as these
small bodies typify the present condition of the world; so will the
world be typical, when it becomes united, of what these asteroids will
ultimately be, a perfect planet.

principles heretofore explained; and this also requires a general de.

ment.  It is not necessary to enter into the particulars of the motions
and actions of elements interiorly existing in this planet, when its
present form was first assumed; for these do not differ in any essential particular from the operations described in previous formations.
But acceding to the calculations which have been made by men
of perception and erudition in reference to this planet and its relations, I speak in general terms, as heretofore, of its degree and station
in respect to planets previously evolved.
It is in density about three times the density of water. Its mean
distance from the Sun is a little more than one hundred and forty

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 197
four millions of miles. Considering its polar diversified appearance
its diameter is about four thousand two hundred and twenty miles.
It presents a decrease of magnitude from other planets, and an increase of density, corresponding in a general sense to its relative
position in the Solar System.  It rotates upon its axis in a little
more than twenty-four hours and a half; and its period of revolution
around its productor, is six hundred and eighty-six days, nearly two
years.
This planet, being also beyond the orbit of the earth, is naturally
of a superior quality and constitution. Its extremely dense atmo,.
sphere presents an illumination of a red appearance. The cause of
this is, that the materials composing the stratified parts of this planet
are greatly attractive to the particles of light thrown from the Sun.
This atmosphere, extending, as it does, from  Mars' surface nearly
twenty-five miles higher than is the earth's atmosphere, prevents the
success of observations upon its surface.  But at its poles there are
peculiar changes and radiations of light —an indication of diversity
of seasons, and vicissitudes about the frigid zones.
The surface presents a great deal of unevenness and appearance
of catastrophic occurrences. For there are several parts of this planet
abounding with extreme elevations and projections of rocks from its
interior; but none exceeding those of Earth's mountainous portions.
These do not exist near the equator, but in the region of the poles.
Its surface abounds with extensive vegetable productions, these
being still more numerous than those of Jupiter, less perfect, but
superior to those of Earth. The animal formations are not so extensive; but they ascend from the lowest up to man in successive modifications of forms which correspond generally to their interior principles. And man there, is in a much more exalted state, both
physical and mental, than the inhabitants of the earth; but he does
not approach the high state of exaltation and refinement which characterizes the other planets' inhabitants.
I will mention the kinds of vegetable productions that are most
used, and not enter into a classification of the general species of
either the vegetable or animal kingdom.
There is a species of tree existing among them that is of vast use.
It germinates and gradually develops itself into a stout, bulky form,
representing the spiral. Its branches are long, and extend far around
the trunk.  Its leaves are very broad, with a mixture of a bluish and
reddish color, with more prominence of the green. Its blossoms are

very beautiful, and its fruit is esteemed among them as the most useful upon their planet. The form of this fruit is very round, typifying
slightly the cocoanut, and is used among the inhabitants as a kind of
bread: and its action upon the system is highly invigorating. The
bark of this tree is also extensively used for many purposes, with a
kind of glue that proceeds from another tree.  It is used in the con3truction of their habitations and in the formation of garments.
But there is another vegetable, of a low stature, that produces
very fine and beautiful fibres, which are very neatly woven together,
and used generally among them as their main apparel.
The INHABITANTS are divided into associated families, and this is
the general and customary mode of living among them. There arc
three extensive families, or nations, upon this planet. But they are
governed by common principles; a result of a superior knowledge
and sense of justice.
There is a peculiar prominence of the top of the head, indicative
of high veneration. The cerebrum and cerebellum correspond in
form and size; and the latter extends upward at the junction of the
two brains; which makes them very susceptible of internal and true
affection. Their form approaches nearly to that of man on earth,
with the exception of its more perfect symmetry. They exhibit a
peculiar dignity and a peculiar air of exaltation in all their motions;
and these appearances are the reflux and configurations of an inward
reality. They are not large: and having a different countenance
from men here existing, this deserves particular attention.
I find that the upper part of the face has a lively, yellowish cast,
and that radiations as it were, proceed from the forehead, the eyes,
and the flush of the cheeks. The lower part of the face is of a different color, being rather dark, with a mixture of the above radiations
from  the interior of their physical constitutions.  They have no
beard upon their face, but this is a representation of it. And encompassing the lower part of the face, neck, and ears (the back part
of the neck being particularly prominent), this darkish substance extends around to the back, where it wi joined with the hair of the
neck; the top of the head being entirely free from any such appearances.
Concerning their laws and governments, their superior love, and
the affection for though/ts which characterizes their spiritual principles,
I will- speak more generally when the application of these things is
made to the inhabitants of the earth.

As to their physical appearance, its beauty is to them inimitable:
while the same to us would appear exceedingly disgusting and undignified. But the idea of beauty is in them as in us, a result of
habitual modes of thought rather than of a knowledge of that which
is intrinsically fine and perfect.  Therefore the only standard of
beauty that can be erected, either on this or any other earth in the
Universe, is that which meets the general approbation of society.
Their attitude is modest and perfect: and there exists great delicacy and beauty of form among the females. They do not vary
much in stature from the males, but being exceedingly straight, they
display perfect symmetry: and there is great affability and courtesy
in the manner in which they approach and address each other.
There are beings of different complexions and constitutions existing
upon this planet. Like the forms in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, they are very dissimilar in materials and appearance, according
to the particular part of the planet on which they were born. I
perceive that some portions of the inhabitants are darker colored
than others; but I do not see that they are numerous.
~ 27. Their habitations and plantations are near the equator.
There are a great number of settlements upon this planet: but all
the inhabitants appear joined in perfect agreement and consociality.
They have digressed a little from the natural law governing their
existence —consequently some imperfection exists among them. But
disease, either of the moral or physical system, is not there known.
They are not governed by arbitrary or conventional laws; hence
they are free from all the inequalities and imperfections which are the
natural results of such laws. But possessing a high moral principle,
they obey that which this principle dictates; and their obedience to
this is rendered the more certain by all their interests being conjoined,
and by all their affections and desires being centred in the workings
of good and righteousness. Hence the basis of all their good actions consists in the interest-principle, which is recognised, tending
toward good results.
Their minds are constantly open for. the reception of all good
things. Light, life, and purity, are to them the highest virtues.
These become associated with their interiors, and the latter are consequently good.
The ideas which we have concerning that which is good, have
arisen from the comparison of apparent ceil. Our ideas of light,.

their seeming opposites.  For if these representations of imperfection were not visible, how would we be capable of forming a proper
conception of what is good, pure, and spiritual  The inhabitants.
of Mars, in their physical and mental constitutions, are as many degrees more perfect than we, as we are superior to the inhabitants of
Venus and Mercury. Hence to the inhabitants of the latter planets,
our condition, and the peculiar and comparatively exalted combinations that exist upon the earth, would seem perfection. And the exalted condition of the inhabitants of other planets would be perfection
according to our ideas.  Hence conceptions of purity and refinement
are enlarged in proportion to the knowledge one possesses of what
is impure and unrefined.
An exalted state of intelligence produces correspondingly exalted
conceptions of perfection: for as the inhabitants of Mercury have
conceptions of perfection far below those which we possess, so are
the conceptions —the mcagnzicent conceptions —of the inhabitants
of Saturn, much beyond ours, and to us inconceivable.  For that
which they conceive to be beautiful, pure, and celestial, is far beyond
the idea of the celestial spheres as conceived by us; and the celestial spheres, the perfection of forms are so inconceivably magnificent,
that a description of them would be considered as imaginative and
visionary. And the conceptions of the inhabitants of Saturn come
as far short of the real and celestial purity of the higher spheres, as
our conceptions are below theirs.
In speaking, therefore, of the inhabitants of Mars, I say they are
perfect comparatively: for the word i' perfect" can only be used in a
comparative sense, though the strongest meaning that can be applied
to it would no more than give an adequate conception of what is
revealed.
Concerning the purity and goodness, gentleness, and kindness, that
characterize the interior principles of the inhabitants of Miars, and
concerning their affection for thoughts, I will now speak.
Their knowledge of internal truths is founded upon the knowledge
which they possess of the science of correspondences.  They observe
all eternal manifestations, and induce truths and principles by analogy. Thus the light which they receive from the Sun, and the
knowledge which they have of the fixed stars, furnish to them correspondences of unchangeable truth, and the light of celestial love
and peace. The growth of plants, animals, and man, corresponds

generally to the changeless law of progression.  The first typifies
-the second; the second typifies the third, &c.; and each form is a
symbol of inherent essences and qualities as forming the material
composition.  Therefore from the form of their planet, and the materials therein contained, they infer a living Principle of Motion.
From  the form of the vegetable they infer Motion and Life.  From
all the monads and animal existences, from  the lowest order to the
highest, they infer Sensation as an ultimate of that which is existing
prior to its formation. From the organization of man, they conceive
of Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelligence. And from these they
endeavor to comprehend their spiritual principle; but although this
principle is the foundation of all thought, it is incapable of seof-comprehension.  And to them, as to us, the spirit is obscure, and as yet
undefined; for the reason that no principle contains within itself the
power of self-investigation.  Every form  in the vegetable kingdom,
from the lowest degree to the highest, typifies refinement and progression toward the animal kingdom..And the forms in the animal
creation, from the lowest to the highest, correspond to the perfection of their internal essences, and stand as representatives of
man.  Therefore correspondences are to them the basis of superior
knowledge.
This knowledge, being pure and truthful, begets an affection; and
thoughts constantly flowing out from their interior knowledge of truth
and reality, unite themselves with this affection. Hence mind corresponds to knowledge, and knowledge corresponds to thought and
affection as the ultimate.*  Therefore an affection for thoughts exists
among them. And the conceptions arising in their minds are always
inevitably true.  And from  their high veneration arises an affection
for truths, which is regarded among them as a celestial affection.
This therefore is their interior condition.
And how pure and high are their aspirations!  And the highest
conceptions we can possibly have, do not transcend the spiritual
peace and purity that exist among them.  In speaking concerning
the earths in the universe, and concerning the celestial purity, spiritual refinement, sublimity, and magnificence, as appertaining thereunto,
* In order to properly understand this phraseology, it is necessary that the reader
should apprehend the distinction which the author makes between mind, knovledge,
and thought. Mind is the essence, knowledge is its condition, and thought is its action.
By mind corresponding to knowledge and knowledge to thought, is meant that mind
implies knowledge, and knowledge thought, each as a necessary sequence of the
preceding.

our conceptions have been light and trivial. Yet all our most exalted
conceptions can not possibly transcend the unspeakable beauty, purity,
and refinement, that exist among the inhabitants of this planet. Their
affection for thoughts is so pure and exalted, that man here existing
would associate the true conception of it with the celestial spheres.
Sentiments arising in their minds become instantly impressed upon
their countenances; and they use their mouth and tongue for their
specific offices, and not as the agents for conversation.  But that
glowing radiation which illuminates their face while conversing, is to
us inconceivable.  Their eyes are blue and of a soft expression, are
very full and expressive, and are their most powerful agents in conversation. When one conceives a thought, and desires to express
it, he casts his beaming eyes upon the eyes of another; and
his sentiments instantly become known.  And thus do their countenances and eyes, together with their gentle affability, typify the
purity and beauty of their interiors; and in their social relations they
display the deepest attachment, and the strongest mutual affection.
Thus peace, truth, and love, abound with them universally; and thus
do light, life, and knowledge, typify and serve as an index of higher
and more perfect spheres.
Such is the condition of the inhabitants of thefourth planet. Concerning the spiritual associations existing among them, more will
hereafter be- revealed; but the useful application may be made of
what has been said in reference to their physical and mental condition, without a further description of them. And it is necessary to
have their condition duly impressed upon our minds, that we may
profit thereby.
~ 28. THE EARTH stands next in order and degree, in relation to
Mfars. But as it is the locality upon which have been formed all the
computations relating to the Solar System, and also is the locality
upon which I reveal these truths, it must be left unnoticed until the
description of other parts of the Solar System is completed. And
when all contemplations relating to these earths, and to the earths of
space, shall have been finished, I will return and give a description
of the creation of the Earth progressively up to the highest ultimate.
which its materials have produced.
In approaching toward the Sun, VENUS presents itself as the next
planet evolved from the great central mass. As the laws that produced other planets have been heretofore duly explained, the same

unchanging principles will naturally be supposed to have produced
the planet Venus. Therefore it is unnecessary to speak of the several
stages which this planet passed through before it arrived at its present form.
Bearingy a closer relation to the Sun than other planets, it, manifests
ulainly the character of the materials composing its body, as being
denser in their composition than those of any planet previously described.  Its density is six times that of water.  Its diameter is
nearly eight thousand miles. It exists sixty-eight millions of miles
from the Sun. It rotates upon its axis in twenty-three and a half
hours; and its period of revolution is two hundred and twenty-four
days. The plane of its orbit is not much different from that of Earth.
It is the placket known as the morning and evening star.  It makes
transits across the disk of the Sun, the recurrences of which have
been accurately and confidently calculated. This phenomenon takes
place while the planet is passing its nodes.
The physical appearance of Venus is less beautiful than that of any
planet heretofore described.  There are very high mountains and
ejected rocks, that disturb the otherwise smoothness of its appearance. Some of these are several miles higher than any upon the
earth; especially upon the side this way, or the polar hemisphere
now presented to the earth.  The other side has more smoothness,
beauty, and fertility.*
A great portion of this planet is covered with water-; and the atmosphere that surrounds it is nearly like that which encompasses the
earth, but is composed of less rare particles.  It receives a great deal
more light from the Sun than any planet receding from it.
There are many species of plants existing upon its surface.  It is
unnecessary to classify them; for it would be of little importance or
use to the world. The trees are generally rather low, very stout, and
very extensively branched. From these to the most delicate plant,
there is a constant assuming of higher stations, according to the
ascending degrees of refinement.  Yet there is much variegated
foliage, and many usefill and tender plants existing upon its surface.
The animals also are not of so high a degree as those of any
* The polar hemispheres of each planet, the axis of which is not always perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, are of course reversed in reference to the earth once
during each revolution of the planet around the Sun. The author in thus distinguishing the sides of the planet, as he does in the text and in two or three subsequent
instances, must of course found his expressions upon the particular position of the
planet at the time this was dictated, which was on the 17th of April, 1846.

planet more remote from the Sun. Yet they are very numerous,
and the more so upon this side. There is a class of animals that
are very strong and ferocious, insomuch that in this respect they correspond to the lion, though they are of a different form and appearance. The animals that inhabit the further side, are of a more docile
and agreeable nature; and they are very useful as assisting agents to
the inhabitants thereof.
The inhabitants upon the further side are in form nearly like the
inhabitants of Earth,- with the exception that heavier materials enter
into their composition. Their breasts are wide and full. The lungs,
and the whole viscera system, are very active and strong, the former
being adapted to inhale the invigorating atmosphere that surrounds
them. Their constitution generally is very good. Theii mental dispositions are very dissimilar to others there existing.  They have a
mild and gentle smile upon their countenances, an index of inward
purity; and their association is to us very agreeable.  And all their
conjugal affections are very strong and good. But they have no
high conceptions of things in the Universe. They reason principally
from externals. They seek for knowledges and scientifics, and are
very much enlightened therein. And yet they have but a slight
knowledge of higher spheres from the conceptions which their scien.
tifics afford them. Male and female are generally purely associated
with each other.  But there are existing manifest imperfections in
their customs and national privileges.  Their general disposition is
an affection for each other-a purely instinctive desire as proceeding
from the law of sensation; and whatever interior suggestions and
promptings they may have as harmonizing with this, are to them
knowledge and refinement. And so their affections and knowledges
conjoin and produce a mental organization nearly like that of the inhabitants of Earth.
The inhabitants upon this side of the planet are exceedingly dissimilar to the others. They are very tall, stout, and physically energetic, and are imperfect when compared with man on Earth. They
have a savage and ferocious disposition, and are very cruel and unkind. They are destitute of all conceptions of right; they do not
receive the spontaneous promptings and approbations that naturally
flow from the spiritual principles of man. They are ignorant of higher
states, and form no conception of the beauty of goodness and refinement. They are in a less perfect condition mentally than any inhabitants upon the surface of the earth: physically, they are several times

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               206
stronger than the latter.  They are full, heavy, and giant-like.  A
barbarous and savage disposition is displayed in all their actions.
They form themselves into troops, and march forth to plunder the
stores of other nations.  They cruelly interfere with the peace and
quietness of the inhabitants of other regions. And when they return
from these degrading and barbarous expeditions, they rejoice with a
beastly gratification in devouring the booty and plunder that they have
so unjustly taken from others. There is a constant tendency to rejoice and triumph in such degrading achievements. And the booty
which they carry away from others, is sometimes their living offspring:
and these they torment and torture, and finally, cannibal-like, greedily
devour them!
In all their connexions with each other, they manifest an entirely
animal disposition.  They do not search into truths-not even into
those which relate to their own being; but they come into existence
and pass out of it again, without the knowledge of the legitimate uses
or privileges of life. Therefore they lose all of the inward consolation that man might naturally otherwise enjoy, because of their unfavorable organizations. They merely live and take care of their cattle
and other things that are compelled to submit to their tyrannical gov
ernment; and theylook no further and seek no higher sphere than
that which is suited to their beastly inclinations.
Thus are two distinct nations inhabiting the surface of Venus.
And the beauty and magnificence of other planets are not by them
conceived of or imagined. But the inhabitants of the further side
approach nearly to the inhabitants of Earth, both in their physical
and mental condition. Their institutions and forms of government
far exceed those upon Earth, because they agree more with the laws
of their nature and of the Universe. But though they are surrounded
with many beauties and pure associations, they are not in a happy
condition, being so unfavorably situated, as has been before described. But as the materials of Venus are less perfect than those
of the further planets, so also must be the composition and situation
of all its ultimates.
Concerning the spiritual inhabitants of this planet, more will hereafter be said; but in reference to its physical and material condition,
all has been expressed that is useful in its appropriate application.
Therefore I feave this planet, and commence giving a corresponding
description of Mercury.

206            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
~ 29. By virtue of laws and principles heretofore explained,
MERCURY has assumed its present existence and form. This planet
is nearer the Sun than any other body in the Solar System. It takes
the lowest point of all the planets, because it is composed of grosser
materials.  It observes, in its revolution, a plane similar to those of
Venus and the Earth; but its orbit is more elliptical.
Calculations that have been made in reference to Mercury, are
nearly correct: but suppositions in reference to the condition of its
surface, are not altogether in accordance with fact.  Its diameter is
three thousand two hundred miles.  It sustains a distance from the
Sun of thirty-seven million miles; and the period of its revolution is
eighty-eight days, it moving about one hundred thousand miles an
hour.  It revolves upon its axis in about twenty-four hours.  Its
density is nearly nine times that of water; and it receives aboul
seven times more light than the Earth. Its approximation to the Sur.
therefore is corresponding to the affinity which the materials composing it sustain to those of the Sun.  Presenting an increase of density, and also of motion, it confirms the truth that was intended to be
impressed, That all materials in the Universe seek association according to their specific gravity and quantity.
Bqing so near the Sun, the planet is not always visible. The
intersecting of orbits causes it to pass over the disk of the Sun about
thirteen times in a century.  The atmosphere surrounding this planet
is extremely luminous, though the light and heat derived from the
Sun are not so excessive as might be supposed: for the materials of
this planet have not much affinity either for light or heat.  Therefore
it rejects that which would otherwise be received, and retains the
quantity suitable to sustain life and action among the forms upon its
surface.
Some portions of this planet are very uneven;' while other parts
are extremely smooth and beautiful. The vegetable productions of
this planet are not very numerous, and are not so refined in composition as those upon other planets.  There are but three general
classes of plants; and from the lowest to the highest of these, we
find upon Earth a correspondence. But as to form, and height, and
beauty, they do not equal those of any other planet.  The highest
vegetable productions generally rise but a few inches above the surface.  There are no flowers, nor foliage, nor trees that cast pleasing
shades; but all vegetable forms are full and gross, rising but little
fron the surface of the ground.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               207
And there are two great barren deserts covering almost one third
of this planet, upon whose surface can not possibly subsist any form
possessing life. And the excessive subterraneous heat existing in
this planet, produces great commotion and excitement among the
watery elements near the borders of these deserts, some of the vents
ejecting boiling water, which is very scalding to any form possessing
sensation. And by a corresponding excitement of the atmospheric
elements, great winds are sometimes produced; and this is while
these elements are seeking an equilibrium. And so extremely severe
are these winds, that the plants, animals, and man, are sometimes
prostrated under their powerful action. These winds generally occur near the region of these deserts; and carrying with them the
excessive heat of the sand and water, they often produce great destruction among the habitations and plantations of the inhabitants.
The animals also, are very imperfectly'formed.  There are not
many species of these, and those that are existing, would be to us
entirely repulsive and disgusting. Besides, they manifest a combative and retaliating disposition toward all things they meet, and a
constant preying upon each other, insomuch that their very active
temperaments are sometimes destroyed, the loss of which results in
the destruction of their lives. Generally they are of an amphibious
and digitigrade nature.
The HUMAN INHABITANTS of this planet are not so numerous
as exist upon others; and they are very imperfect in their material
organization.  Still they manifest the same incessant activity as do
the animals.  And they have a peculiar mental constitution, the general traits of which are strong attachments, great concentration, great
highmindedness and self-respect, with a most powerfully retentive
memory.  This latter is the strongest faculty belonging to them.
They manifest great promptitude in anything depending on memory;
for in the memory of things consists their knowledge. Each one
has a great desire to be thought more enlightened than any other
beings in existence: and having this self-persuasion, they presume
upon their memory to profess the intelligence that no other beings
possess.  They do not investigate the causes of things, but try to
conceive of the uses for which all things are intended. Anything
relating to memory, therefore, is to them the essential of knowledge.
And they do not depend upon their sensualities or inclinations as
a source of knowledge, but rather seek the internal, caring little for
the slhades by which substances are oftentimes concealed. A per

son conversing with them and endeavoring to display elegance and
beauty in his expression, would be altogether disregarded: for unfavorably as they are situated, they dislike to have their ears addressed instead of their understanding.  Therefore in conversing with
each other, the shades that are thrown upon any subject by these
affabilities, are altogether rejected, and they retain only the substance
of the conversation.  They consider that words and technicalities
are too often mere false sheaths to conceal a corrupt and imperfect
interior.  They admire only the truth and the goods of truth, and
not the deceptive shades that are often thrown upon it in communicating it to others, and to the world.  In this particular they excel
the inhabitants of Venus or the Earth; but in all others they are imperfect in correspondence with the situation that their planet sustains
in reference to other earths.
They have no well-organized societies or communities; but rather
are governed by an ignorant arbitration that has been instituted
among them. But this planet has not been inhabited longer than
about eight thousand years; while the other habitable planets have
been peopled for innumerable ages.
War and persecution have prevailed among them to an extreme
extent; and strife, and malice, and all things that result from ignorance and folly, have obstructed their progress for many ages. And
at this moment, one of those destructive battles is about being consummated.  They manifest all the characteristics belonging to the
most ferocious animals. Their implements for the destruction of
one another, are curiously hewn stones, which are thrown from a
sling at each other, and which when they strike, cause horrible
incisions.
Theirbody is covered with a kind of hair, and their countenances
are very full and dark; and the whole appearance of the body would
be to us no more pleasing than that of the orang-outang.
And as they are now existing, they show forth all the results naturally arising from a degraded situation and a depressed intellect.
They are in a more unfavorable condition than the inhabitants of any
other planet: but still, in the general contemplation, they are uses
for the accomplishment of more perfect ends. They are rudimental materials that are gradually ascending to higher stages of refinement; but only as elements disunite, the highest from the lowest,
and ascend:to enter into new and more perfect forms.'Thus the inhabitants of Venus and Mercury are in some particu

lars above the inhabitants of the earth; but generally, much more
gross and imperfect.
~ 30. Concerning the luminous Centre of our Solar System, and
the indescribable results of its inherent pregnation, much has been,
and much more might be said. But as it is the body that contained all
else that now exists within its powerful influence, it was spoken of in
general terms before the descriptions of the planets were given.
Many conceptions have been formed in reference to the condition of
the Sun at the present time; but as these have been formed by a
process of analogical reasoning not altogether allowable, it is proper
that I should mention some of the general features of this great
Centre.
Its diameter has not been as yet correctly determined.  It has
been calculated as being eight hundred and eighty-six thousand miles
in diameter, and the results of calculations have varied from this to
that of a million miles. Also its exceedingly luminous atmosphere
has given rise to the opinion that it is surrounded by a phosphorescent accumulation of particles, the decomposition of which produces
gight.  And also the dark portions that are occasionally seen, art
thought to be spaces unoccupied by its atmosphere. But as the
appearance of a substance is not always an indication of its rear
reality, so in this particular, as in many others, external observations
have failed to give a true conception of the thing observed.
The inconceivable quantity of materials that are still contained inr
this body, may be inferred from the previous description given of its;
primary condition.  The particles still existing in the Sun, are of a
gross nature in some portions, while at the surface it is constantly
evolving refined elements, in the form of heat, light, and electricity.
These elements are constantly emanating from, its interior, and their'
combination prevents the success of telescopic observations.
Concerning the ultimate productions of this body, more will be.
said hereafter; but inasmuch as they have no possible bearing upon
the objects of the present generalization, it is unnecessary to speak
of them now.
The Sun therefore is the central body from which all the planets
and satellites within the extreme circumference of its influence, have.
been formed.  It is yet incessantly giving off particles, rarified and.
refin'ed, and exerting an orderly influence upon all forms and particles in the planetary system.  It can not decrease in magnitude; fir.

210             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
it has become a planet of the requisite degree of density, belonging
to a more interior Centre. Also it has formed all that its substance
can well produce; for it is now counterbalanced by the magnitude
of the whole planetary system united; while the T/Whole is conjoined
harmoniously, and all motions are in accordance with the general,
established law of gravitation or association.
It is now necessary that a general contemplation upon these creations should be instituted, in order that the mind may properly conceive of original Design.
It has been established incontestably that there is an order and unifbrmity manifested in the formation of our Solar System-that front
the first body evolved, to the last, there is an ascending order and
degree of refinement distinctly evident in each.  For Mercury being
the last in formation, is consequently composed of denser materials
ihan any other, and hence takes the lowest point, and observes the
greatest velocity of motion.  And it has been established by astronomical observations, that as we recede from this planet toward Uranus and others, a superior refinement is observed in each from the
nearest to the most remote, and a corresponding modification in their
motions and their relations to eaclh other. Also, that the plahets that
were further off evolved satellites, while those which were nearer did
not: for refinement and activity are consequent results of each other;
while grossness, imperfection, and comparative rest, are the results,of such sluggish materials as compose the nearer planets. Therefore
there is a perfect order in the formation of the planets, and in their
relations to each other and to the Sun; and there is a perfect uniformity in the connexion of the Sun with them' all.
The law of ceaseless progression is also established: but while
Jupiter and Saturn are in the mind, the condition of planets less per-fect, and which were subsequently formed, would seem to indicate a
retrogression, —but not if it is properly borne in mind that the lowest
contains the highest, undeveloped, and that the.highest pervades the
lower, and extracts therefrom all particles fitted for higher degrees of
association.  For the composition of M3ercury has, uzndeveloped, all
that Saltur  has manifested.  Therefore Mercury typifies a higher
formation; and so does each planet represent higher degrees of perfection.  For there is nothing existing in the Universe so low and
imperfect that it does not represent some higher spheres; and there
areno forms or substances in being so perfect that they are not the





## p. 211 (#239) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                211
lowest of some still more perfect. Therefore there is a constant indication of transformation, and also of ceaseless progression; for it is
impossible, as has been proved by previous investigation, for any atom
to take a lower degree than that which it at any one time occupies;
but all must of necessity ascend to higher conditions.
Moreover, the Sun is a never-failing symbol and Embryo of all
material formations.  It is the Vortex, the great Centre that previously contained all that has been since breathed into existence as
connected with our planetary System.  And the materials existing in
this great Centre became impregnated and active by virtue of inherent
forces,-the result of which was the teeming productions which are
now manifested. Therefore it is a body corresponding to the Sun
of the Universe; and all its planets correspond to the great planets:which the original Sun breathed into being. And the satellites correspond to the planets which the great planets or suns produced.
Thus our Solar System typifies slightly, the inconceivable Solar System of the Univerccelum!
~ 31. The vegetable formations of each planet, indicate the character of the primary particles which produced them. They also
represent higher stages of formation. And it is from the existence of
plants, manifesting Motion and Life, that the animnal kingdom  is
properly conceived of; for there is a close connexion existing between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. And as the animal kingdom is one degree more perfect than the vegetable, it is characterized
by Sensation as a result of Motion and Life.  Therefore these three
principles, Motion, Life, and Sensation, have combined in one. And
it is only when we form a proper conception of Sensation, that we
know of Instinct.  Then again the animal kingdom  typifies still
higher stages of refinement; and an unbroken connexion exists between the animal and Man.-And MIan stands as an ultimate of all
the materials and forms upon the planet's surface, showing a combination of the principles of Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelligence.
Motion also typifies Life, and this Sensation, and Sensation Intelligence.
Therefore the inhabitants of Mercury represent higher forms of the
same species.  And so the human inhabitants of each planet typify
and signify the existence of some niore perfect forms, and some higher
stages of human organization. And there are successive links of connexion observed between the vegetable, animal, and man, as forma




## p. 212 (#240) ############################################


212            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
tions of each planet, and an unbroken chain joining the inhabitants
of the lowest planet to the comparative spiritual inhabitants of the
highest, for one represents the other, and none of them represent the
least retrogrcssion.
And on grounds like these here furnished, have we based our ideas
of opposites; for when meditating upon the degraded and imperfect
condition of the inhabitants of Mercury, and contrasting them with
the inhabitants of Saturn, whose composition, both physical and mental, transcends almost our highest conceptions of the celestial forms;
and when considering the extreme distance between them, and observing all things so apparently disconnected, —the mind at once
conceives the idea of positive opposites. For what can be more entirely opposite and antagonistic than the lowest stage of physical formation is to the highest degree of material refinement? -or than
ignorance and imbecility are to the sweeping intellect, and to the
spontaneous conceptions flowing from  the interior of a perfected
mental constitution?  Or what can be more entirely opposite than
death and life, good and evil, or light and darkness?
It is evident that to conceive properly of light, life, and spiritual
intelligence, we must first see that which is apparently the o2l)posite.
And the very moment that we see the lower conditions, we form a
conception of higher spheres; but this we do not do until the former
conditions are made visible.
It is now manifest to every enlarged understanding, that the lowest
typifies the higlhest; and the very moment you conceive of such a
representation, all idea of o0posites is annihilated. And as the first
must exist before the ultimate, so all things must harmonize perfectly,
and conform to the established law of universal and eternal progression. Therefore opposites do not exist; but that which is gross,
and imperfect, and an)parently opposed to higher developments,
merely has not progresscd to the standard of perfection that we have
erected.
The vegetable formations in their adaptations, also give us the true
conception of uses for the accomplishment of more perfect ends or
ultimates. The plants not only receive nourishment from the mineral kingdom, but also from the atmosphere; and they more perceptibly give to the atmosphere, particles and elements to sustain higher
forms. The animal kingdom receives its nourishment from the vegetable, and from the atmosphere that it partly produces. Therefore
the plants are uses adapted to the wants of the animal kingdom. So





## p. 213 (#241) ############################################


WATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                213
likewise are these two kingdoms adapted to the uses of Man. Herein
again is the general law made manifest; for the lowest not only typifies and represents the highest, but one is absolutely necessary to the
existence of the other. And without general principles, putting forth
general uses, to produce general ends, none of these forms would have
existed.  But the evident truth that in everything cause and effect
are inseparable, not only establishes an unbroken connexion between
every particle in the Universe, but presents to our minds, and to
every inductive mind, the highest representation of the original Design
conceived by the Great Positive Mind!
Thus in our Solar System all things in the Universe are represented. And as it is impossible for the mind to form an adequate
conception of anything beyond the harmonious System to which we
belong, this is the appropriate field for present investigation. For
though thought is unlimited and uncontrolled, thought is not knowledge.  But it is useful to investigate that which sustains so close a
connexion with the investigator as to admit of comprehension; and
the knowledge thereof will promote his peace and happiness.
The description that has been given of the order in which the planets were formed by an evolution from the Sun, differs exceedingly from
the description given of the formation of the Univercoelum. For our
Sun was represented as originally extending its substance and atmosphere to the orbit of the outermost planet; and it has been shown
that by a shrinking and condensation, and an evolution of particles,
the Sun and trle planets have assumed their present form and condition: while the Sun of the Univercoelum-the inconceivable Centre
around which infinitude, almost, revolves-was described as originally the only Form in being, and as emanating successive and concentric Circles of Suns, each of which produced other suns, planets,
and satellites, until the sixth Circle was formed.  As one and the
same Principle must produce all things in the regions of space, it is
evident that only one description of formations can be correct. Inasmuch as this discrepancy appears conspicuous, it is necessary to
mention the intention of the previous descriptions.
The object of describing the Univercoelum as it has been described,
was to enable the mind to form a most extended conception of infinite
space. And the Great Centre being inconceivable, and its emanations still more so, it was described in that manner so that an obscure
tonception might be formed. But as the Solar System is more im

mediately connected with the observations and investigations of mankind, it was, in speaking of this, necessary to give a correct idea of
the order and process of the planetary formations; and from this description we may conceive of the Univerccelum, and from this alone.
The general correspondence existing between all things, will be seen
more conspicuously hereafter, especially when the description of the
earth and all things therein existing shall have been finished.  Then
I receive impressions from higher spheres, wherein exists the knowledge of all interior and eternal truths.
~ 32. I come now to the portion of this revelation that is most
immediately connected with the curiosity and interest of every enlightened mind, and upon the subject of which an incalculable amount
of thought and speculation has been conceived.  It is a subject that
has excited the wonder and inquiry of the generations of all ages, and
of the inhabitants of every portion of the earth; and it still involves
a question of immense interest as undecided.  It is a subject in respect to which philosophical and psychological minds have put fortl
all their powers of investigation, and concerning which there has been
a constant antagonism between philosophy and theology, and between
chimeras and reason. —TiIS SUBJECT IS THE ORIGIN AND BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.
Philosophy has endeavored to account for the origin and formation
of this globe on principles of Nature and Reason; while theology has
put forth every effort to sustain the opinions entertained by primitive
generations, and sanctioned by theological authority.  Scientific philosophy has indisputably demonstrated the immutability of natural
laws, the immortality of Trutlh, and the unchanging nature of all principles governing the Universe.  And thought has partially lifted the
veil that has so long concealed the truth from the minds of the world;
and this has been done by thought alone, the most exalted faculty
belonging to the human mina.
Nevertheless, general truth has been arrived at by pursuing curved
lines through the mythology and superstition of every age and nation.
The lines that lead to truth unmingled with error, however, are perfectly straight; and these, if pursued, lead gradually beyond the

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               215
realms of darkness and ignorance that may have environed the mind
of the traveller; and every step that is taken, ushers him into a more
beautiful light. And thus he approaches Truth by the light of Reason and the unchanging laws of Nature: and when le arrives at the
Truth, he finds himself surrounded with grandeur and magnificence
that can be conceived of and appreciated only by one who has the
supreme love of eternal Truth dwelling within him.
The mythological opinions of primitive nations have been gradually and imperceptibly modified, as knowledge has been unfolded in
the minds of mankind. ~ And these modifications have been so imperceptible to each subsequent generation, that the nineteenth century
only unfolds a true conception of the change, by its contrast of truth,
and light, and knowledge, with the ignorance and superstition of the
extreme ages of antiquity.
Some have ignorantly supposed that the world assumed its present
form and condition in an instant of time; and that it was supported
in its present position by gigantic beings, each of which was supported
by others still more powerful, until supposition lost the foundation
upon which they all stood, amid the realms of fancy and imagination.
And the opinion reigned from this period up to a few centuries ago,
that the world was perfectly immoveable, and perfectly flattened at its
surface.  And this belief prevailed universally, until a mind became
enlightened through the exercise of reason, and discovered the true
position and figure of the earth, and its relation to other planetary
bodies. And having philosophically demonstrated the correctness
of his position, he ventured, with an unparalleled audacity, to reveal
it to the minds of the world, Superficial theology was at this time
reigning with all the power and authority of omnipotent law. The
light that he presented to the world was so far above the darkness
that prevailed, that the human mind was generally dazzled with its
brightness.  The darkness was impenetrable, and therefore the light
was repulsed; and the discoverer was nearly sacrificed upon the altar
of ignorance, superstition, and bigotry.  But the light was not altogether concealed, but imperceptibly flowed into the minds of a few
others; and by emanations from  these, others also received the
truth-until the whole truth became light and dispersed the darkness: and the nineteenth century stands as an evidence of the intellectual resurrection.
Others, again, have supposed that from  an incomprehensible
Notking, a tangible Somethling, was created; and to admit that some

thing always existed, was contrary to the assumptions of a mythological theology. And by a gradual modification of these opinions,
a duration from the creation of the world was fixed upon by many
primitive nations, which varied from six thousand to forty thousand
years. And the records of ancient nations are brought forward to
sustain and confirm these opinions in reference to the world's origin
and duration.
Yet all these opinions have become essentially changed; and philosophical and natural investigations have served to erect a more substantial doctrine-one that does conform to the highest suggestions
of Reason, and to the sanctions of immortal Truth. Yet so imperfect have been the endeavors to arrive at the true result, and the
paths through which the mind has travelled have been so irregular and diversified, that it has taken many thousand years to progress to the point which the present age has attained.
Theology and philosophy, therefore, have been apparently opposed to each other.  While one was endeavoring with all its energies to discover an indestructible basis upon which a true theory of
the origin of the world could rest, the other was putting forth all the
deplorable obstructions that naturally arise from ignorance and fanaticism. And so universal was this prevailing enthusiasm, that philosophy for a long time struggled in vain to overcome the obstacles
which it threw in her path.  And the philosophic mind has been
endeavoringl( to become unchained and free from things that are not
true, that it may seek those which are unchangeably and eternally
steadfast.  And this is the constant yearning of a truth-loving mind;
while the constant yearning of a narrow and undeveloped mind is to
conceal the light and truths which Nature sets forth, and to erect
in its stead a superficial chimera.
Yet the question how the materials and essences that compose this
world, were produced, and how they were formed into their present
condition, has not been satisfactorily answered.  And as it is so intimately connected with the aspirations of every inquiring mind, it is
necessary to give an adequate answer-one that will be distinctly
comprehended by those who have an enlarged conception of the
physical laws of the Universe.
For this world has given birth to all the thoughts that have been
conceived by man here existing concerning the constitution of things.
It is the theatre of human action; it is the habitation of pain and
pleasure, of life and death, of knowledge and ignorance.  And it is

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                217
this world that has given birth to all the beautiful and variegated
flowers and foliage that adorn the vegetable kingdom.  It is the
birthplace of the innumerable animal existences which come into
being and sink into repose before the eyes of man. And the earth,
and Nature, and her laws, have given existence to M3la7n, the ultimate
of material perfection. It has endowed him with faculties, and
powers, and sensibilities, the extent of which is not yet comprehended.  It has stamped upon every particle of his constitution the
impress of eternal Design. It openly manifests the immutable laws
by which his organism was produced: And all these ineffable truths
yield to the powers of an enlightened mind!
And the mental constitution of man is so distinctly symbolical of
higher spheres of purity and refinement, that the most degraded of
all beings that ever have existed upon the earth, have formed some
obscure conceptions of the higher spheres.
But instead of passing off in sublime peregrinations into the fields
of Nature; instead of cherishing the incessant and spontaneous
inflowings of thought respecting the foundation and magnificent structure of the Universe, and enjoying the steady unfoldings of light and
truth, the mind has left Nature and Reason, and gone in search of
that which is altogether unwarrantable, and exceedingly destructive
to the happiness of the world.  And thus man has lost sight of the
true relation existing between Nature and science, and science and
himself. And so depressed and degraded has been the condition of
the world, that language is inadequate to describe it, and thoughts
and feelings can only supply the place of expressions.
Such has been, and such to an extent, still is, the condition of
things which this world has borne into existence.  What, then, can
be of more value and importance than a knowledge of the world's
original condition, and of its ultimate termination?-a  world in
which Nature has put forth the most tender efforts to yield a happy
race!-a form in which Nature has so perfectly adapted all things
to the wants and requirements of each other, and to Man, that reciprocal justice, universal happiness, and eternal righteousness, might
prevail throughout all its diversified avenues and recesses! And so
pure, so good, and so indescribably magnificent, have been the productions of this world, that it is not astonishing that all the interests
of man are centred in the inquiry concerning its origin and destination.
Let, then, an unprejudiced and philosophical disposition characterize your minds, so that you may be enabled to follow distinctly

the lines and indices of the immutable principles of Nature, to their
legitimate terminations. And let it be from a profound reverencefrom an interior and supreme love of these principles' AUTHOR, that
you adhere to their legitimate teachings.  Let the mind be deeply
impressed that all principles of Nature are merely breathings, and
emanations from a First Principle-from a primitive Essence-from
the GREAT POSITIVE MIND! And let Nature be considered as the
thoughgs and effects of this great Mind.  And let all her productions
be understood as the highest types and representatives of her inherent and never-dying energies, having their origin in the First Principle of all things.
In entering upon generalizations so immense and stupendous
as the subject under present contemplation requires, it is necessary
that every general and particular as connected with the course to be
pursued, should be distinctly understood, so that nothing maybe
misconceived or misinterpreted.  And in order to understand these
things properly, the terms used, and their application, should be
explained.
When speaking of Mi-atter, I have reference to the tangible and
material combinations of the earth and all things therein contained,
including the substances and essences that are existing in the material
Universe.  When speaking of the Laws of Mlatter, I have reference
to the visible tendencies of matter, such as have been termed attraction, repulsion, gravitation, chemical affinity, and association. When
speaking of the laws of the Universe, I have no reference to the laws
of Sensation or Intelligence; for to Man these laws appear far above
any other laws governing matter. For the mind does not perceive
the connexion between the lower and the higher, or the material and
the spiritual, though in reality the law is the same in both. But it
differs only as the composition and organization differ; for the material gradually ascends to spiiritual composition and is subjected to
spiritual laws, by a chain of unbroken and ceaseless development.
But this thought is too immense for the mind to grasp, and especially
to comprehend in all its main ramifications. Therefore, while speaking of Matter and Motion, reference will be had to the general physical laws of the Universe; and in this manner should the terms used
be understood. For the law that governs exalted compositions will
not be referred to in speaking of the formation and history of the
earth.

5 33. At a period too remote for computation, there was an accumulation of an inconceivable and incalculable magnitude, composed
of atoms ahd particles that previously constituted the atmosphere of the
Sun. And the latter was an inconceivable time in producing this conjugation of particles-whose consentaneousness was such that they
subsequently became condensed, and by the action of perpetual energies inherently existing; gradually (and so gradually that the lapse of
time during the process is unimaginable) produced the oblately spheroidal form of the earth and its satellite. The primitive diameter of
this great agglomeration of particles could not be well determined;
for it subsequently and continually decreased in magnitude according
to the condensation and consolidation of the whole mass.
Before entering into any particulars concerning the formation of
the crust or coating of this great mass, it is necessary to contemplate
its condition and appearance as the same -would have been manifest
to the senses.  The whole body of atoms was sustained in its appropriate position by the mutual relations existing between it and the
Sun.  The particles thrown from the Sun became associated by the
natural affinity which they had for each other as owing to the similarly
refined condition which they had arrived at before leaving the great
central Mass.  The force by which they left the Sun is termed repulsion,; and their association together is called attraction: and the
position of the earth in reference to the Sun is the result of what is
supposed to be the laws of attraction and repulsion.  And as these
are terms familiarly applied to these conditions of matter, it would be
necessary to use them if they were not evidently incorrect, and employed in the absence of a proper understanding of the natural and
mutual laws pervading the material Universe.
Particles incessantly emanating from the Sun as suitable to enter
into the composition of this igneous mass, gravitated to it, and immediately established an association with it.  The whole mass was in a
state of igneous fluidity, and was of inconceivable magnitude.  It
contained heat of an intensity far exceeding any that is known to the
inhabitants of the earth. It was an immense liquid sphere, which
was agitated fiom the centre to the surface with indescribable undulations, such as would naturally occur in so great a mass of uncondensed and molten lava.  And while it was observing the impulse
of the force originally given it, it consequently assumed rapidly forms
ascending from the angular to the spherical, gradually developing
diameters, axes, and poles. And as the development became more.

perfect, its rotary motion became established and improved. Its revolutions were also followed by the assuming of proper bulk and form,
and position to obey its original impetus.
But before this condition was produced, a greater amount of time
elapsed than can be possibly imagined; for in speaking of the gradual
assumption of forms, and the establishment of rotary and orbicular
motions, I have reference to the development of these after the great
mass had undergone a great condensation.
The rotary motion is an effect produced by the impetus of particles and atoms rushing to the great body.  The same is represented
in the forces by which motion is applied to any round body. And
its revolutionary motion in an elliptic orbit, having an aphelion and
perihelion in contraposition to the Sun, is an effect produced by the
general impetus given it —by a perpetual application of the forces
producing the rotary motion. And inasmuch as its orbit is elliptical,
the evidence is manifest that the whole body was thrown from another
body more immense, having the same motions, which were in accordance with its own immensity.
The proposition that the original condition of the materials composing the earth was that of igneous fluidity is evidently correct, as
is manifest from the condition and appearances which the great mass
has subsequently assumed. That it could not have been solid, or
elastic, is evident from the form of the earth and of all other planets.
It would be impossible for any solid or elastic substance to assume a
spherical form; for the extreme density of solids, and the adhesive
and repulsive tendency of elastics, would exclude the possibility of
matter in either state assuming a globular form.  It is evident from
this (and there are other general and well-ascertained truths to substantiate it), that the primal condition of the earth was that of a kind
of fire-matter, in a state of active fluidity.
It would be inappropriate for me to mention the experiments that
have been performed, the result of which lias been to establish this
fact beyond the possibility of refutation. -And while I am impressed
to speak truthfully concerning the original and subsequent conditions
of the Universe, it would be interfering with the efforts of philosophical minds to merely repeat old, or introduce new, illustrations of what
is now nearly incontestably established. For let it be remembered
that the proposition or theory is a general one; and let it also be
duly impressed, that the evidence presented in its favor is as general
and comprehensive. Therefore the argument takes no cognizance





## p. 221 (#249) ############################################


NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               221
of isolated phenomena or opinions; but it is based upon general ap.
pearances as conspiring to establish the proposition.
The fulness at the equator, presents another indication of the same
truth. The cause of this fulness, together with the form of the earth,
could not be accounted for upon any other ground than the admission
that the Whole was originally in a state of fluidity, and subjected to
inherent forces that incessantly acted upon it according to chemical,
mechanical, and geometrical principles.
~ 34. That the substance composing the earth originally comprehended the orbit now observed by its satellite, and that there was an
interchanging of particles going on between each accumulation of
atoms; and that they sustained the position that they do to the Sun
by virtue of the relative affinities of particles composing the Sun and
them —tl-at this theory is correct, can not well be disputed. For
how could the particular distance, density, motions, and velocity,
which they manifest be determined by any other law, or conditiorof
primeval matter? And by what other process could the earth and
its satellite assume an identical position in relation to other planets
and the Sun?  This proposition is also general, and the evidences
adduced in its favor are equally so.
And that the original form was angllar, ascending rapidly to the
circular, is also a general truth.  Representations of these forms are
presented in thefirst forms upon earth, as subordinate to the circular
and others.  The trap and basalt that have been thrown from the
interior of the earth (and that, too, by the virtue of internal heat),
indicate these forms esl)ecialbl, inasmuch as they are the most prominent and rugged manifestations in Nature. It is impossible for any
substance to assume any form  above the angular, as the first.  It
mnatters not how rapidly this form is modified to the circular, or spiral; for the first must exist before the second or any other can.
Notwithstanding the change may be imperceptible to the senses, yet
such must occur, in all the lower states of material composition.
Forms may have previously ascended, and may be bringing forth
their like; but their origin is only referable to the angular, as the
basis of all forms.
The proposition that the Whole was in a state of undulating agitation-of inconceivable, wave-like motion, caused by the circumstances under which the whole Body was existing, is distinctly
evinced, not only from the primitive history of the earth, but in the





## p. 222 (#250) ############################################


222            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS,
fact that the earth displays rugged and uneven portions, termed
mountains and valleys.  These appearances are known to exist, more
or less, in various portions of the earth; and it is impossible to account for their existence on any other supposed original condition of
things. For it was only when the fluid Mass became gradually transformed near its surface into an elastic state, that this roughness could
have been produced.  Still, the great body presented no more roughness than any other body thus subjected to the action of the different
elements would have presented. If this does not prove the oceanic
motion of the whole Mass, it is left to the investigations of other
minds to prove the contrary.
And the proposition that the earth observes its motion as the transmitted and hereditary motion given it by its Productor, can not be
well disputed. For it is a known law among all elements, and all
principles exhibiting the relation of cause and effect, that the object
acted upon will indicate the force which acts on it.  And the effect
must be in proportion to the cause, and there must be a perfect correspondence between the two, or it can not be demonstrated that the
effiect ever had a cause.  And all we know of things as effects, is
dependent upon the knowledge we have of the cause which produces
them.  And the satellite manifests precisely the effect of what we
have asserted were the forces acting upon it: and the earth in its
rotary and revolutionary motions, and in the observance of its elliptic
path, manifests exactly that which existed in what we claim to have
been the Cause or Fountain which ushered it into existence.  If this
is not substantially and philosophically correct, it is the duty of speculators to explain more distinctly the cause of the motions of the
earth and other planets.
The elements and constituents that were involved in the great
earthy Mass, were adequate in their properties and qualities, when
subjected to favorable conditions, to produce all forms that have subsequently been assumed, not only in the mineral but in the vegetable
and animal kingdoms. And the indescribable beauty and magnificence that were sequestered as undeveloped in the great Whole, are
not yet conceived of or comprehended.  For as the Univercoelum was
the Embryo of all other existences, so each form produces, through
successive modifications and assimilations, all the substances that generate forms and entities, whether solid, elastic, or fluid, upon every
planet's surface. And deep beneath the crust of this great mass,
there are existing undeveloped beauties and magnificence such as

can not possibly be conceived of by a comparison of anytbingrwhich
has been developed.  Several thousand miles of molten lava and
unimaginable fire rolls through the subterraneous abodes of the earth.
And there are more stupendous wonders contained in this deep ocean
of fire-matter, than have been ascribed by man on earth to any of
the departments of the Solar System.  The admission of this truth
(and it can not be denied) presses upon the mind contemplations
which transcend the pbwer of expression, and which almnost overpower its own energies.
But it is necessary to proceed to a description of the formation of the
early coating of this igneous centre.  Geological investigations have
done much to familiarize the true principles of Nature to the mind;
and they also have done much to establish an indestructible basis upon
which may be founded the investigations and analogical reasonings of
this and future generations, so that by known truths they may be enabled to arrive at those which are not so distinctly evident to the senses.
And so useful have been the discoveries in the geological department, that they have contributed to promote liberal views and speculations, and have greatly dispersed the darkness that has so long concealed the origin and primitive history of our earth. Besides, geology has led to many useful classifications, both in the mineralogical
and zoological developments, insomuch that the true basis of the latter sciences appear to have been discovered.  And until these classifications were made, and the connexion between one science and
the other was discovered, the mind could not observe the adaptation
of one composition to another, nor could it see the relation harmoniously existing between the elements of all sciences and of tihe
world. Many happy conclusions were previously arrived at, but the
bases on which these were founded were not altogether allowable
until Geology took a conspicuous position as pointing out that which
originally existed, and as demonstrating the connexions and relations
of all other developments.
Geology has applied definitive terms to each formation, both of the
earthy, vegetable, and animal kingdoms; and the use of these in the
following revealment, becomes both proper and expedient.
~ 35. Let it be understood, then, that the whole fluid mass was in
a state of motion and agitation, and that the whole abounded with
inconceivable heat, the first development of fire. While in this condition, the elements, both interiorly and exteriorly, were incessantly

224            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
active. The surface of the whole mass was gradually and imperceptibly relieved of its heat; and by a consequent shrinking and
condensation of particles, the whole surface became united together
by an elastic coating.
It is impossible to compute the time that elapsed after it assumed
this condition, before it became sufficiently consolidated to produce
the primary, granite rock.  This was accomplished by the constant
relief of internal heat-by the giving off of that element which
caused the fluidity of the surface previously. And as heat escaped
from the internal, so did particles ascend and unite with the consolidated parts.  And thus by a constant accumulation and dispersion
of molecular substances, the primary, or granite, was developed.
Notwithstanding the surface was exceedingly uneven already, it
became more so by the catastrophic and volcanic operations that followed this closing up of interior heat.  The inconceivable agitation
of the internal, the mighty conflict of the roaring elements, the expansion of heat and particles, and their constant struggling to obtain
relief, produced some of the most terrific explosions; and rocks
were expelled that still stand as an evidence of the original, internal
excitement reigning throughout the bowels of the earth.
The whole domain of the earth's surface was free from the existence of any forms possessing life or sensation. These wonderful
ejections of rocks on many portions of the earth's surface, caused
immense valleys, in which were contained seas of almost bottomless
depth.  Some of these seas extended in depth from the highest
points of land, nearly four hundred miles.  These valleys were a
necessary accompaniment of such stupendous prominences.
At this time the water covered nearly the whole face of the earth.
This element being an active agent, add a cause of action, began its
powerful workings upon the sides of these mountains and ejected
rocks. And by the incessant action of this excited element, these
rocky portions of the earth were gradually and imperceptibly worn
away. And the same cause, producing the same effect, is still in
action throughout the watery wastes of the whole earth.
I mention water as being deposited in these extensive valleys, and
as producing such effects upon the portions of rocks which it surrounded. The element known as water was not then existing as composed of the same substantial elements with the water now upon
the earth's surface. For in the first place, it was impossible for oxy

gen and hydrogen to have been developed, especially in sufficient
quantities to produce in combination these oceans of water.
Nevertheless, it is known to all investigators that oxygen composes
a great part of the whole crust of the earth; and that nitrogen greatly
pervades Nature; and that hydrogen, intermediately active in many
substances, also enters into the composition of water. And fluorine
has also been lately discovered; which is rather an ultimate of nitrogen
and hydrogen, in the combined states in which they are often found.
And carbon exists in some forms, though not so extensively as the
other elements, being seldom found pure, though it sometimes occurs
in fine, pure forms, as those of diamond. And there is not existing
in Nature any combination of particles that does not contain some or
all of these elements; and it is impossible to find them totally disconnected.
However inconsistent the above proposition may appear, it is nevertheless true, —for the manifest reason that at this stage of formationoxygen and hydrogen could not have composed water; because having no attraction from without, they could not have been developed.
They therefore remained in the gross form that will soon be described,.

one fourth'the specific gravity of quicksilver.  It would have been)
as impossible for trap and basaltic rocks, and recent formations, totbe
ejected by the action of interior elements, as it would have been for:
these simple elements to be developed.
It is only by a proper knowledge of the physical. laws governing:
Matter, or of the tendency that Matter constantly indicates,. that a
true conception can be formed of qualities contained in any composition, whether simple or compound.  And with a standard of density
-one that has become conventional and established, the density of
all bodies is defined by comparison.  Thus water has been agreed
upon as having the density of 1000; and the densities of all other
bodies are expressed according to their relations to this standard.
It has been a subject of much discussion among scientific minds,:
whether matter is ultimately indivisible, or whether it is infinitely divisible. So far as instruments-and experiments have succeeded, they
have been unable to determine upon the possibility of an unlimited
division of particles. Substances have beendivided and subdivided
until they were reduced toga fine powder, or fluid, or gas, and stil,.

scure and incomprehensible.  For even when reduced to tne finest
powder, or to the most subtle fluid, it has been manifest to the experimenter that each particle composing these elements contained a number of still finer particles far beyond the powers of multiplication.
And in proportion to the refinement of particles has the wonder increased; and the conclusion now appears irresistible, that instruments
can not be so far perfected as to divide the elements or molecular
atoms pervading immensity.  For composition, and decomposition,
and recomposition, are tendencies which matter manifests in every
department of the Universe.  The whole Mass of Matter, including
all elements and principles, is conjoined by association; and this fact,
whether as relating to substances gross or refined, defies all power to
reduce particles composing any form of matter, to their ultimate state
of disconnexion.
It is upon this foundation that rests principally the proposition that
the original fluid, or watery element existing upon the face of the
world, could not have been as rare as the water formed firom the
combination of oxygen and hydrogen.
The substance known as granite, is of itself a combination of other
substances in which one or more of the following may be found.
Mica is not generally very prominent; but feldspar, quartz, and hornblende, are more conspicuous.  And these again are composed of
an indefinite number of elements and particles, -and these also of still,other associated molecules, &ec. And the combination of the whole
produces the former substances.Now it is by an infinity of inconceivably minute particles, which
themselves have a far more interior composition, that the prominent
substances, or rocks, or the elements contained in them, are organized
and established. And when the bases of compositions incessantly
occurring throughout all Nature, are not comprehended, how is it
possible that a conclusion should be formed as differing fronm that
which the proposition sets forth, viz., that the density of the watery
element covering the earth's surface was in proportion to the density
of the composition of the granite, which latter bore a similar relation
to the substances entering into its own composition?
Nor is it proper for the scientific world to institute questions which
they themselves can not answer, as a substitute for as substantial refutation of any theory. Yet this is the way in which men have generally proceeded to throw obstacles in the way of new theories-they
h}ave attempted to darken and mystify the whole by propounding a

great number of interrogatories, such as the human mind is not capable of either answering or comprehending. I would, then, merely
remind the scientific investigator of his inability to pronounce the
proposition erroneous, especially until he has deliberately investigated
the general evidences that are presented to sustain it.
~ 36. Matter is a term  used as equivalent to the substance of
everything in the Universe; but as substances are changed, so are
also the names by which they are designated.  And commencing at
granite, as being originally of the proximate density of quicksilver, we
next come to an element of the density of sulphuric acid; then to
water; then to sulphuric ether; then to the atmosphere; then to its
ultimate, fluorine; then to the imponderable elements known as magnetism and electricity.
There is a diversity in the attributes and motions of imponderable
elenments, simple and compound, that is not as yet in the least understood or imagined.  For it was only after these principles had been
for ages incessantly producing phenomena before the eyes of the
world, that the dia-magnetic principle* was discovered; and. this is
but an index of more extensive discoveries. By a force not as yet
altogether ascertained, the magnetic needle has manifested a general
uniformity in its position, the cause of which has not been thoroughly
understood.  And it was not until a scientific mind had discovered
the dia-magnetic or intersecting principle, that a proper conception
was suggested, and which will lead to a true solution of the great
problem. And thus the physical laws and principles of the Universe
have been manifestly obscured to all previous philosophical investigators.
*The contents of this section were delivered on the 29th of April, 1846. What is
here said of the " dia-magnetic" principle was entirely new to me at the time, having
never heard of the term. On subsequently asking the speaker for a more particular
explanation, he replied, in substance, that an imponderable element had recently been
discovered, the motion cf which intersected the current producing the direction of the
magnetic needle. On my inquiring the name of the discoverer, the clairvoyant passed
off (i. e. spiritually, the body assuming the inclined position, as is explained on page
38), and on returning he remarked, "It sounds like"- (hesitating and passing off
again) —" he is known as Professor Faraday." I mention this phenomenon, apparently unimportant at first view, as one which establishes the fact of the clairvoyant's
receiving impressions of sounds as well as of facts and things. A paragraph in a
newspaper subsequently fell under my notice, containing a brief statement ofFaraday's
discovery of a principle which he terms " dia-magnetic;" but of this it is certain that
the clairvoyant had no knowledge while in the normal state, when the above paragraph was dictated.

This digression from the main subject is intended as an appe/l:xi
to the new proposition introduced, in order that hasty minds may
thereby be induced to consider before pronouncing a sealing denunniation.
At the period last contemplated, the whole face of Nature manifested the most inconceivable convulsions, the result of which was
the ejection of rocks and mountain prominences, the interstices between which were filled by a fluid element of one fourth the density
of quicksilver, or exceeding somewhat the density of sulphuric acid,
which is about twice the density of water. This fluid was produced
by a development of the grosser forms of oxygen, of sulphurous acid;
of alumina, and of carbon. The gross forms of these elements (the
only forms that could possibly have been at first developed) were uni
folded by the action of the envelope of the whole Mass, and by the
affinity which the lighter particles had for the atmosphere that then
surrounded the world. These, when conjoined, produced the watery
element that had a specific gravity comporting with its relation to the
granite, which latter also, in its density, sustained a corresponding
relation to the interior igneous elements.
The atmosphere that then enveloped the whole Mass, was altogether unlike that which now encompasses the earth. A dense atmospheric composition was emanated from the internal elements. This
in specific gravity was not much less than water now existing. No
form possessing life could have existed upon the earth's surface while
the elements were in this state; and they continued in this state
through a number of ages that transcends all computation.  The atmosphere was composed of a very small portion of nitrogen, one sixth
of carbon, and the remainder consisted of the imperfect developments
of hydrogen, sulphur, and fluorine. The peculiar affinities which
these sustained to each other, have since become greatly modified;
for whereas all elements were then but imperfectly developed, certain
ones have now ascended to the perfected form of our atmosphere,
while carbon and other simple elements have gradually become sequestered among the mineral and vegetable compositions on and beneath the earth's surface.  Thus the refined particles have ascended
and assumed the form of the simple and compound substances that
now surround the world and pervade immensity, while others have
graduahly ascended to fill their deserted stations, and others again
have descended to enter into the mineral substances for which they
have had an affinity.

Thus at this epoch, and after granite had been formed (this being
a composition of mica, feldspar, quartz, and hornblende), the condensation of ultimate particles produced the watery element, the ultimate,)f which produced the atmospheric envelope. At this period there
was going on successive developments from one composition to anothler, as one became able to produce and sustain that above it. And
such in reality were the only elements that could have existed at this
epoch of the earth's formation.
Another evidence of the density of this watery element, consists in
the fact that all the original rocks and prominences were acted on and
worn away by the water then surrounding them. The force of the
present water could not have produced this result, especially in anything like the length of time in which these rocks were red\uced by
the ceaseless action of the waves and currents.  True, the water
produces the same effects still; but let it be carefully impressed that
it is connected with other substances, the action of which accelerates
the disintegration.
A telescopic view of the earth from AMars or Venus would at this
time have presented the same appearance that is sometimes presented
by Mars and Mercury. It would have exhibited a deep red appearance, encircled by a dark ring of atmosphere; the same as we would
naturally expect if a planet were in a state of fusion, or in a burning
condition.
As this element exerted this constant action upon the early rocks,
particles were gradually carried and precipitated to the bottom of the
seas in the form of sediment. Depositions were thus formed in every
chink, and crevice, and vacated portion, of the sea-bottoms throughout the earth.  And as the accumulation increased, so the heat that
was beneath the whole incrustation ascended through the portions
deposited.  And as the heat ascended, the deposited materials became united; and thus were formed the primary stratified rocks
known as gneiss and mica slate, interspersed with mica schist, &c.
And as the granite was an index of the watery and atmospheric developments, so was the second formation an index of elements that
must then of necessity become purified and comparatively refined,inasmuch as every succeeding stratum unfolded new principles, the
ultimation of which tended to the refinement of the watery and atmospheric compositions.

mation concerning the solids, fluids, and aeriform substances in being.
It has not, however, been able to discover all the elements that are
existing in the composition of the earth.  But it has been successful
in establishing some most important facts, the tendency of which is to
enlighten the world.
The primitive elements are supposed to be fifty-five in number,
about forty of which are metallic, and the rest are non-metallic.
These, in various modifications, are supposed not only to form the
substance of the whole earth, but also its gaseous elements.
One very important fact that has been discovered in relation to
oxygen and carbon, is that these largely pervade the substances of
the crust and on the surface of the earth.  Carbon and carbonic acid
gas prevailed more extensively during the period of early stratification than at any time since that period.  Lime contains in every
cubic yard, ten thousand cubic feet of carbonic acid gas: and carbon
also enters into the composition of coal, to the amount of from sixty
to seventy-five per cent.  This proves evidently that these substances were very extensively disseminated throughout the surface of
the earth: and if they had ascended into the form of atmosphere,'
the very first phenomenon would have been the extinction of every
living form, if any such had existed.
This amounts to an absolute demonstration of the proposition in
reference to the density of the elements that primitively surrounded
the whole igneous mass.  For a condensation and sequestration of
carbon into the substance of lime and coal, manifests its original
state of development; and the fact that it descended into such a state
of consolidation, manifests plainly that it was superseded by some
more rare and perfect substance.
Then again, the accumulation and stratification of substances which
were originally contained in the composition of granite, distinctly
proves that each of the four substances, mica, hornblende, quartz,
and feldspar, were composed of particles that would admit of a further subdivision. Many portions of the primary rocks are characterized by one or more of these compounds as distinguishing them
from the neighboring portions. Such are the quartz rock, mica,
schist, &c., each having sometimes the same position in the order of
formation, with strata composed of other substances.
My object in. impressing this upon the mind, is to prepare the way
for the admission, as being probable, of that which characterizes all
subsequent formations. No substance has as yet been formed, which





## p. 231 (#259) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  231
contains properties and elements that were not existing in the primi.
tive formations.  And that the first sedimentary strata followed the
latter as a sole consequence of the action of the waters against the
ejected rocks, is plainly manifest, inasmuch as neither this nor the
previous formation manifests any infusoria or marine polipi, that are
so largely manifested in the succeeding formations.  The granite and
sedimentary rocks may therefore be considered as constituting the
first coating or covering of the igneous mass of the world.
But before proceeding further in our researches into the geological
developments, it is proper to understand the laws of crystallization.
And here again the world is indebted to chemistry for some very
important discoveries.  It is a well-established truth, that every substance in a state of crystallization possesses, before its coherent elements are reduced to a fluid or gaseous state, forms that it never
again assumes in subsequent condensation.  Crystals may be produced by the compression of substances before they enter into any
higher state than that of fluidity. And crystallization may be produced by other processes, the most perfect of which is the sublimation of particles by reducing them to an ultimate or gaseous condition. Corrosive sublimate, phosphorus, platinum, and diamond, all
display forms produced by the condensation of sublimated and gaseous particles.  And this phenomenon has been so uniform that it is
now exciting the attention of philosophic minds, the result of which
will be a new theory concerning the atomic structure of the Universe.
Th'l'  first stages of crystallization in any substance demonstrate the
angular form  of every particle engaged in the process.  The first
congregation of particles produces the least perfect form of crystallization. And by dissolving this crystal, and causing its particles to
ascend into the fluid or gaseous condition, and to become again condensed, there is produced a finer and more perfect form of the crystal. This therefore proves that as atoms ascend from the lowest
state toward the highest, they assume more perfect forms.  They
become, in passing from the angular toward the circular, &c., so perfected that, when condensed, they compose the most perfect state of
crystallization.  The observations in chemistry, therefore, have led
to this discovery, the tendency of which is to establish incontestably
the progression and perfection of forms such as are exemplified in
all crystallized bodies.
The element of silicon combined with oxygen, forms the substance
known as silica, which is found in granite.  And so similar elements

232            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
compose other substances, the combination of which forms tile primary stratifications. And how easy it is to discover the reason why
a formation like that of granite should have been thefirst produced!
It is because the original atoms were anguluar.  These being the
lowest and most imperfect, take the first J)oint in the formation;
while every other- f6rm is contained in these, undevelolped.  Therefore more recent formations display new compounds, new conditions,
and new appearances; but they contain no substances that granite
does not contain.  Therefore no elements have been brought into
being during the successive stages of formation, that did not exist in
the beginning; and all the difference existing between the higher
and lower substances is owing to a change in the forms and composition of particles.
The earth primitively, then, was in the undeveloped condition
before described.  And the first condensation produced the granite;
the second development was that of the fluid mass referred to, and
the third, being the ultimate of the last two, was the atmosphere.
The whole of these have become essentially changed as circumstances have changed. And so a constant sublimation was then, and
is still, going on, the evidence of which is plainly manifested in every
form, high or low, in being.
At the period when all chemical and mechanical causes were in full
operation, of which the formation of the primary rock was a result,
this, by fusion and subterranean agitation, assumed positions exceedingly fantastical.  Then the circumference of the earth was a
little more than thirty thousand miles.  And during the lapse of
innumerable ages, a coating of granite was formed, of nearly one
hundred miles in thickness, all of which was before the gneiss and
mica slate system  made its appearance.  This, again, assumed.a
thickness corresponding to its position and relation to the granite, and
the powerful action of the watery element, which latter also entered
largely, by condensation, into its composition.
By the constant workings of the interior and external elements,
the lower strata of this became modified, and the highest, becoming
partially disintegrated, formed, by constant accumulation of sediment,
the clay state and grauwacke slate system.  And this may properly
be termed the transition from the primary to the fossiliferous formation; for in it are fossil remains, almost without number. Plants are
scarcely visible by any other evidence than impressions remaining
Jupon the rocks. In this formation is found the series of fossils

known as crinoides, conchiferae, poliparia, crustacea, and indistinct
traces of marine polypi.
It is evident, then, that at this period imperfect plants and animals
must have had an existence.  And geologists have irresistibly adopted
the conclusion that a modification of the atmosphere and earth was
the occasion of the production of these.
~ 38. At this period of the earth's history, wonders of a still more
profound and interesting nature present themselves for research and:steady contemplation. The primary coating of the igneous mass has
ascended to the grauwacke slate system; and the water and atmosphere have become essentially changed, having one more degree of
refinement than they possessed during the formation of the last system. And Motion is also ascending, and entering into forms possessing Life.  At this period plants had an existence, whose indistinct remains have been discovered. These were forms that had
not progressed to the flowering, and thus are called flowerless plants,
crinoidians, &c.
In contemplating this epoch, an unanswered question arises for solution. - Thefirst ascension of Motion, or the origin of L~e, has been
a subject of much speculation in philosophic minds, for the special;reason that it is the foundation upon which must rest a proper solution of the question concerning the creation and organization of all
things subsequent to this phenomenon.  But though the subject of
the origin of Life has been subjected to such deep investigation, no
powers of scientific analysis, or human speculation, have as yet been
able to solve the great mystery involved in this question.  It has
been, and still will be, a subject of extensive discussion, whether AMotion, by any possible means or modification of its conditions, can produce the phenomenon of Life.  But it will be fodnd a subject
susceptible of easy demonstration, if it is properly considered that the
First of all things is an Embryo of all other existences; that it is a
Germ, containing the essential qualities to produce higher states of
refinement; and that when subjected to favorable conditions, it will
unfold its real nature, and expand into new forms, new substances,
new elements and organizations. And (as was intimated during the
process of the Key to this portion of the Revelation), Motion is the
first of all living Principles contained in living matter,-and the
ldtimate of this, together with that of its vehicle, Matter, produces
Spirit. And therefore it is easy to understand that one more step in

234            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the crder of ascension fiom the condition which the word Motion indicates, would produce the phenomenon of Life,-there being also
a similar ascension of materials as forming a proper vehicle for the
same.
The opinions generally prevailing upon this subject for many ages,
have been altogether untenable and unphilosophical.  Causes have
been conceived of which have had no existence in Nature, as being
the immediate agent of breathing the first breath of life into every
form.  And thoughts that have originated friom these suppositions
have tended much to restrict the general inquiry which it is proper
should be made in reference to this particular subject. But the conditions that were required for the development of Life, have been by
physiologists, to some extent investigated; and these have endeavored by known laws to demonstrate the true principles and process
of gestation, and the materials and conditions necessary to such a
process of development.  But experiments that have been instituted
have, as a general thing, failed to produce the phenomenon of gestation; and the conclusion has been generally adopted, that this can
not take place under any circumstances, save through the ordinary
instrumentalities. Experiments, however, in one or two instances,
have to a great extent succeeded; that is to say, by a proper compound being placed in a favorable position, and acted upon by electrical forces, life, and a singular species of animal, have been produced.
But experiments of this character can not have any possible bearing
upon the question under consideration; for if life and activity were
the results of such experiments in innumerable instances, this would
not lead to a proper solution of the question respecting the origin
of Life.
Nazture contains all the forces necessary to institute all the conditions, and to produce all the developments, that occur in the earth
and on its surface.  And by properly conceiving of a uniformity in
Nature's laws, we can form an adequate conception of the successive
developments that are the results of such.  On this basis we may
establish a law of teleolog/y; and upon this we may repose, having
the most perfect confidence in the workings of Nature's principles, in
suitable combinations, in the production of the various developments.
And thus we may have a steady, unchanging, and unerring guide.
whereby we may be enabled to associate our thoughts and aspirations
with the higher states of the ascending laws.
This, then, is the era in which M1otioon becomes Lif:, and in which

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                235
materials enter into combinations suitable for its development,-of
which combinations plants are the types and indications. By what
process Life could have been developed, is a question of the utmost
magnitude, inasmuch as it involves in its recesses, the ennobling
powers and intellectual endowments of Man. For the very moment
that one particle attained li./ upon this earth, that moment Life, Sensation, and Intelligence, were determined as inevitable and endless
results. For, as it was before remarked that if motion were given to
one particle in the great Mass composing the SUN of the UnivercceJum, this would establish motion in every atom in existence, which
motion would be eternal,-so if one particle receives the essential
quality of Life, from that moment is established the endless duration
of Life, and of its consequent results and manifestations. How inconceivable, therefore, is the importance attached to the plain and distinct answer which the question demands!
And I am aware that opinions which have existed, and which still
are in being, concerning this subject, will, on due investigation, be
rendered to some minds altogether repulsive and unreasonable, while
by other persons these opinions will still be adhered to with all the
energies of ignorant and misdirected minds. And minds of the latter
class have, at all ages of the world up to this moment, wielded more
influence and power than all the powers of Thought and Intelligence.
But are there no principles upon which the true investigator may
rest undisturbed? — no sanctions of Truth and Virtue sufficiently
powerful to sustain him in his positions? — no basis upon which
Truth and Philosophy may remain unshaken, amid the conflicting
elements of fanaticism?  And is there no power in truth and goodness to sustain the investigator against the encroachments of principles which Nature and its Productor have never instituted?  Should
a blind and enthusiastic zeal be allowed to crush the efforts of the
free mind-one that discovers by proper induction, the Source from
which all principles originated, and reveres that only which bears the
indestructible signet of the Eternal, Positive Mind?  Should that
mind be restricted whose meditations are the pure influxes of Nature's
principles and beauties which are everywhere extensively manifested?
And it has been a want of the proper knowledge of the principles upon
which Nature and Truth-exist, that has obscured this great subject
so long from scientific minds.
It is not necessary to discuss the proposition, yet unrefuted, that
Life is a progressive development of the principle of lMotion, and.

tliat the marine plants were the first forms suited for such development. For animals could not have existed before vegetables, because
the first is an ultimate of the second, containing one more principle,
which the plant only typifies.
~ 39. Very extensive discussions have also arisen in reference to
the laws of mutation of species and progressive development. The
general opinion existing in reference to this subject, has arisen from
the diverse indications of the first and subsequent rocks containing
plants and animals, and from the general classifications into which
these seem naturally to arrange themselves. This opinion is, that:
the whole creation, from the lowest to the highest formation, has proceeded in an order of succession, so as to exhibit a general correspondence as existing between the geological and zoological creations.
And this opinion has become very popular, insomuch that other
opinions appear to stand openly attacked thereby. And the professors of these have in return endeavored to refute the previous hypothesis, not from the supreme love of truth, but because they have
been p)reviously attacked. And to ward off this attack, it was not
necessary to investigate with a pure desire to unfold the truth, but
with the intention to sustain preconceived opinions. And efforts to
this end have been made by arraying a multitude of counter evidences, not of a general, but of an assumptive, gratuitous, and incidental character, so that the theory which opposed them might in
return be itself successfully opposed. By such procedure, nothing
has been gained for the furtherance of science, but something has
been lost in the unceasing efforts of different persons, to refute each
other's opinions. For becoming lost in the mist of contention, the
mind loses sight of the rule that should always be uppermost in the
mind of man, That Truth should be the object to be attained, and
not the establishment of opinions or hypotheses.
Argument, therefore, is not required in the present instance to show
the truthfulness of this or any other proposition; but all that is
required is a definite explanation of the origin and character of the
first forms which Nature breathed into existence previously to tile
carboniferous formation.
Abstract experiments and observations upon the laws and principles
that govern the sublime works of Nature, have gradually prepared
the way for the unfolding of knowledge concerning the mode in
which each particle assumes its specific and destined position. And

here again the sciences of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physiology,
take a position as the most useful and important among all others,
especially as these have determined upon many substances between
every component atom of which there exists a demonstrable chemical affinity.  There is an okstacle to the full and complete success
of these researches, because it is absolutely impossible for man, with
his present knowledge concerning'the fundamental principles of Nature, to form instruments so perfect that the most rare particle can be
subjected to a minute analyzation.
It is not the object in the present instance to make the known
truths in science conform to the original condition of the earth; but
it is the object that the fundamental principles upon which Nature
unfolds her stupendous creations, should, by progressive development, ultimate in the truths which these sciences have unfolded to
the world.
Chemistry will unfold the fact that lig/ht when confined in a certain condition, and condensed, will produce water: and that water
thus formed, subjected to the vertical influence of light, will produce
by its internal motion and further condensation, a gelatinous substance
of the composition of the spirifer, the motion of which indicates
animal life. This again being decomposed and subjected to evaporation, the precipitated particles which still remain will produce putrified matter similar to earth, which will produce the plant known as
thefucoides.  It is on the results of this experiment (the truth of
which, as above represented, can be universally ascertained), that
rests the probability, though not the absolute certainty, of the truth
of the description which I am about to give concerning the first -formn
possessing life.
As has been before remarked, all the elements had undergone a
material and substantial modification, at the close of the transition
rock, or grauwacke system. And many portions of the sea-beds
were at this time in a state susceptible of giving birth to new forms.
The change in the watery element had been general; for carbon had
become more universally disseminated, while oxygen, in comparatively minute portions, was imperfectly assuming its present gaseous
state. The substance in granite known as quartz, the most perfect
combination of oxygen and silicon, was combined with the limestone
in which carbon was so extremely condensed; and a uniting of these,
and the warmth generated thereby, acting with the favorable affinities
of the water and atmosphere, created in some portions of the sea-beds

and partially protruding rocks, a composition assuming apparently the
state of rest, while in reality the imperceptible motion existing in it
was decomposing and uniting particles, and creating a principle of
internal vitality, or vis vitce.
Here was manifested the generating power of motion, and the phenomena of life, of death, and of reorganization. For the decomposition of any one atom in these gelatinous masses, represented the
disorganization of all bodies, or death; while the recombination represents the principle whose pregnation results in bringing into existence new forms and organizations. And the constant activity existing in the whole mass, united by forces heretofore explained as association or affinity, not only manifests the unchangeable laws of Motion,
but clearly represents all the phenomena (not yet properly understood)
that are presented in the process of gestation.  Masses of the above
description were existing in various parts of the earth, and upon the
segregated beds formed by the action of the elements upon the first
stratified portions of the earth's crust.  These breathed into existence the forms termed flowerless and marine plants, the highest type
of which is thefucoides.
Let it be duly impressed that the basis of these formations consisted principally of mica, quartz, and hornblende, modified by the
associated particles of lime-which in decomposition produced from
their inherent elements the forms above described.  Let it be further
impressed that granite and limestone, including the mica slate, had
not previously entered into any particular organic composition.
Plants of this period were not very perfectly formed, being destitute of ultimate portions (or seeds, flowers, and foliage), and being
unsuited for any other purpose than that of producing a higher order
of forms-the former merely rcprcsenting- the latter.
Here MIotion and Life became visible.  Motion was originally and
eternally established; while Life, its ascending development, was first
manifested in the imperfect forms of marine plants. All conditions
agreed for this production.  No artificial energies were required to
bring them forth. No new force, quality, or principle, was necessary
to the successful development of that which is known to us as Life.
Nature displayed her living energies in the first forms, though imperfectly. Yet these represented and typified tho highest process of
gestation and reproduction, and the highest organization that has beer,
sut)sequently produced, and which now exists as these first types
investigator.

5 40. Ascending in the scale of being, the radiata and polyparia
stand next in order,-these being results of the decomposition of
former substances, and of combinations of these with other elements,
the whole assuming, as a consequent result, the form next in the
order of development.  The term "radiata" is improperly applied;
lor forms which this term implies were not in reality existing.  But
as it is not necessary to discuss the definitions of geologists and zoologists, or the generic names that have been applied to forms in the
animal kingdom, I will proceed directly to describe the nature of the
animals that have been thus named, as this was then manifested,both of those upon the inland portions, and of those which then were
extensively swarming through the watery waste, — with the operations performed by the latter.
The polypi were active in forming from the solution of lime and
other compositions of like nature, the imperfect coral reefs, which
now stand as an evidence of the ingenious work of these animals.
The radiata were below these, assuming the form of suspended moss:
having an interwoven and complex membrane, the vehicle of transmnitting imperfect sensation, more properly life, that was exhibited in
the radiating feelers that were thrown out from every portion of the
united substance.  So perfect were these feelers, that any molecule
or substance passing near them would be suddenly caught, and by
an active decomposition-that which is known as digestion-they
would unite these with their own substance; and from this cause
their nature was subjected to constant change.
Through the successive modification of these, the articulata were
developed as next in the order.  The radiata so perfectly typified
the ascending form, that if the whole were cognizable to the senses,
the whole subject would be plain and demonstrable.  This class
(which may yet be termed lplants) were constituted with innumerable
chambers and multivalve portions, the whole mass be'ing entirely
ventral.  The annelidans and serpula, are species of these.  Uniting
with these successive re-assumptions of forms, were the univalve and
multivalve shells, so termed by geologists.  Also in the same system,
are included the crustacea or trilobites, and the radiated spirifer,
which species soon became extinct, as they could not be permanent
productions in consequence of bearing such an inseparable relation
to the previous type.
As a link in the transition from  the radiata to the articulata,
the productus and terebiratula occur.  And these are composed

240             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
chiefly of the particles that were floating in the solution of lime, mica
slate, and gneiss, after these had become modified in the first forms.
Thus the productus became another type, and an active agent of
incessant transmutation, inasmuch as the forms above these show a
correspondence thereunto, only being more perfect and complicated
in parts, —the purpose of which was to produce, by a still further
ascension, the succeeding class and species of animals which the
carboniferous formation so extensively exemplifies.
In the present class of vegetable formation (for in reality no other
species were yet existing),* innumerable shells were formed as the
result of the workings of the existing class of beings possessing the
principle of vitality. These were ventral, valved, and chambered,
and interlined with a soft, gelatinous, moving, living membrane, near
the osseous portion of the animal.  Many of the above species became extinct a long period before the completion of the carboniferous
strata.
Trihe period occupied in the transition of the whole globe, is to us
inconceivable; for Nature at this period manifested no impulsive or
catastrophic occurrences, but was calm and quiet, and to us would
have appeared entirely desolate, inasmuch as no objects were in
existence but the minute marine plants.  But as these forms represent the progressive development of Motion to Life, and of lower
to ligher species, they stand in analogy to the mighty developments
of the earth, water, and air,-there being a constant ascension of
each to higher stations, the vacuum caused by their ascension being
supplied by particles ascending from inferior stations. And so the
whole gradually unfolded conditions for the introduction of a new
era. The termination of the era in being is distinctly proclaimed by
the more exalted organizations which a change in the elements, conditions, and forces, was the immediate cause of developing.
I join all the vegetable developments of the grauwacke and clay
slate system into one general class, that of the avertebrated.
The reason why I denominate all the living developments of this
period vegetable and avertebrated, is because Sensation has not as yet
become a distinct principle. That it has, can not be proved from
any class or species of productions yet discovered by geologists.
* The clairvoyant requested the insertion of a note stating that the reason why his
classifications of the organic productions of the ancient periods differed slightly in
some respects from those made by geologists, is because he found that the latter did
not strictly conform to Nature.

NATURE' S DIVIN'E REVELATIONS.                241
Animals could not have existed previously to plants; for the condition of the earth and elements was altogether inadequate to sustain
animal life; while the prevalent carbon and kindred elements were
capable of sustaining the minute creations and developments of the
vegetable kingdom.
The term " sensation," as applied to life, vitality, or a minute degree of motion, is altogether improper; for sensation is as distinct
from  life as life is from motion.  For sensation is the principle that
connects the inner life, or spirit, with the external body.  Life may
exist, where sensation does not. The phenomenon of life should be
understood as a mere ascension of the principle of Mlotion, —this developing inherent energies, and causing an imperceptible transmutation and reproduction of the substance in which the principle exists.
Such, therefore, was the character and condition of the forms developed at this period.
Before ascending to the carboniferous formation, it is necessary to;
notice the subdivisions that are made of the ascending strata.  The
first has been termed the "Silurian,"-owing to the manifestationr
of this rock in a portion of the country which the people of the above
name first inhabited.  Thle next in order above this, is termed the
" old red sandstone system."  It is very remarkable, and is so considered by geologists, that crystallization is not visible in the composition of the sandstone to any particular extent. It is very evident that
this formation was produced by the congregation of ultimate particles of the mica slate, gneiss, limestone, and shale; inasmuch as particles of these had become so essentially modified that the sandstone:
only could be produced thereby. And at this period, the trap and,
basalt were existing in projecting positions in various parts of the dry
portion, but more extensively under the surface of the water.  Theserocks contained greater quantities of crystalline matter, which was.
prevented by circumstances from forming in the sandstone system.
The latter formation is in some parts of the globe very thick, its.
thickness varying from three thousand to ten thousand feet.
This period developed a still higher order of animals, which the
Silurian system ultimately typified.  Fishes now became extensively

molluscs, the gastropod becomes developed, and also a still higher species, which is the cephalopod.  The radiata and articulata, in their
progression, now begin to assume the form of the scarpion and insect,
between which the fuci determined upon by geologists, sustains an
intermediate position.  The seas at this time were inhabited by annelidans and scarpion fishes, the ultimate of which represents nearly
the shark and sturgeon. The annelidans were a species of sea-worm,
still to be found upon many coasts and coves, where stones and other
bodies of concealment exist.  Of this class there are two kinds, the
white and red, the first of which is hermaphrodite, sustaining an intermediate position between the lower type and the bigher, in which the
serpula becomes visible.
5 41. Plants at this period have ascended to the sigillaria, with
but little modification, although the same subsequently ascend to the
class conifcrce, which the carboniferous formation so extensively manifests in the slender, beautiful pines of which remains are found. The
positive distinction between the vegetable and animal creations, does
not appear before the carboniferous stratification, when disintegration,
decomposition, and segregation of the primary formations, had become
very extensive.  There was also a corresponding ascension of all the,elements, the same being plainly exemplified in the preceding formation containing the fish, shark, and other marine productions, the
origin of which can be traced to the first vegetable, gelatinous pro-,ductionT. And as this period represents the two kingdoms in a more
distinct manner than did the previous, the line of demarcation can be
correctly drawn between them, notwithstanding many interspersed materials from the Silurian and sandstone systems that consist almost entirely of shells, the species of which are identical with the original molluscs. These representations will become more clear when a descrip-;tion is given of the crust of the earth as it was prior to the change of
ithe dense element, which resulted in the formation of the limestone.
This era, then, shows an ascension of animals to one degree above
the avertebrated. Yet if these were properly arranged in order, the
highest would show a great dissimilarity and superiority to the first
species of the same classes -the species which I shall designate as the
osseous fish development. For the convoluted and muscular organi-:zations of the sandstone period, of which fish is the type, have not as
yet assumed the posterior portions that characterize the proper ver-,tebrates. For none of the species of fish now existing ascend in

organization much beyond the gelatinous composition of the annelidans, excepting in form and texture, these being such as to require
a different concatenation of forces to produce muscular activity and
marine locomotion.
By the deposition of particles still in process by the action of the
elements, and by the tides which at this period covered nearly the
whole face of the earth-tides which were of excessive magnitude
and force,-and by other local causes, which will soon be explained,
the extensive solutions of lime then existing, became, when conjoined
with other substances, deposited to form the great series of strata
known as the carboni/'rous limestone.  At this time marine aninials
and land plants were developed; and the latter began to shade a
small portion of the earth's surface that had for ages innumerable been
one extensive watery waste. Dry land now became manifest, —and
now followed a development of soil as resulting from the decolnposition of gelatinous substances previously existing upon the same portions; and from this sprang up minute vegetable formns. Existing
mountains then became still more prominent, and others were soon
ejected, by tile unceasing action of the interior of the earth, which became excited at this time by ththe change of the elements which placed
the external and internal in altogether unequal conditions.  The
equilibrium had been gradually destroyed by the ascension and
constant recombination of the watery element, whose previous density
had balanced the expansive force of the interior.  Therefore, to restore this equilibrium, the internal portions must have vent; and this
was obtained by the extensive upheaving of those mountains now
known as the Apennines and the Andes.
But the description of the mountains previously existing, and of
those ejected at this period, should not be given until after some
preliminary observations upon which depends a proper conception
of the inequalities and wonderful catastrophic occurrences which at
this time apparently confuse the general order of Nature's laws, and
her otherwise harmonious operations.
The earth had, by condensation, become two thousand miles diminished in circumference since its magnitude was as before stated,
which was during the elastic state of the primary coating.  The seas
were not so deep as before, though the surface of the water was more
extensive.  This change was caused by the expansion of previously
condensed particles composing the water; for it is a well-known law
in chemistry, that as particles become sublimated, they expand and

consequently occupy a greater space than before. And this period
represents the condition of the water in its progressed and ascended
state. Being therefore higher than before, there was visible only a
smrall portion of those stupendous mountains, that are now towering
many thousand feet.  Therefore innumerable shells, and immense
collections of all kinds of plants and animals then existing, were conveyed by the tides almost to the very tops of these and other mountains, and there deposited in the crevices and undulated portions of
the rocks that compose them. And portions now prominent being
previously entirely covered by the waters, and constituting the bed
of the sea, became strewed with various plants and fossils which the
water and other substances had yielded, and when ejected to such an
immense height they retained these fossils and impressions.-And
these have in many cases confused and destroyed the order of creation in the minds of geologists, because previous formations and succeeding ones are alike found together.  But as these are particulars
and details, the naturalist and geologist should not array them against
the law of order and harmony which the uniformitarian endeavors to
establish as constituting a system of progressive development. Furthermore, tides at this period were greater than any which are?low in
operation. For the waters were accumulated to immense heights
every fourteen hours, being twice elevated during the period of the
earth's revolution upon its axis.
The theories that have been presented to the world concerning the
phenomenon of tides, have generally been very incorrect.  It has
been supposed by a conspicuous astronomer, that tides were produced by the law of attraction —by the action of the moon upon the
earth.  This can not be true; for attraction is not an established
principle, especially beyond the atmosphere of any body or substance.
To show plainly the impossibility of this being the cause of tides, I
will present some of the chief considerations which have an important
bearing upon the subject.
If the moon has any attractive influence upon the earth (more than
what consists in the natural relation existing between the two bodies),
why, when the moon is in conjunction with the sun, does not the
water become more elevated on the side of the earth next to these
bodies, as might naturally be expected if such attraction existed?
Also, substances upon that side of the earth would not then weigh
near so much as when the moon was otherwise situated. Also when
the moon is on the opposite side of the earth, and the earth sustains

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                245
a position between it and the sun, why is not the elevation of the
water equal at all portions of the earth?  For if the moon and sun
exert an equal influence, the result should be equal heights of water
all over the earth.
~ 4G2. It does not become the character of this book to discuss
previous opinions, incorrect hypotheses, or points of philosophy
thought to be established; but it is the object and end to give to all
investigators equal justice, and the highest approbation so far as their
researches have been for the furtherance of truth, and for the enlighteninog of the minds of the world concerning the principles upon which
Nature performs her energetic and sublime workings. For if it were
the intention to dispute opinions which have been founded upon the
appearances which things have presented, then the discussion would
be almost without end. For the falling to the earth of a substance
previously suspended in the air, has been termed gravitation.  The
tides have been considered as the result of the same principle. All
things have been represented as possessing, to a greater or less extent,
the principles of attraction and repulsion- a perfect and established
tantagoonism. And inasmuch as this is the belief now extensively prevailing, it is not possible that a different theory or hypothesis can be
received unless it addresses the understanding of man with more
plainness and cogency than the former theory.
It is a well-ascertained truth in astronomy, and in the principles of
mechanics, that a body rotating like the earth on its axis, has the
greatest tendency to throw off substances in the direction in which it
revolves. As the earth revolves from west to east, and, at the present time, once in twenty-four hours, it must of necessity produce two
elevations of water, especially as the water surrounds the whole globe.
Every twelve hours, the water would be elevated at the extreme east
and extreme west, or in other words, at given antipodes of the earth.
The elevation of water once in twelve hours, is a result of the centrifugal tendency that the globe creates in one half of its period of
rotation,- corresponding tides being thus produced on the opposite
sides of the earth.
There are many things operating incidentally upon the water,
which produce variations in the periods and elevations of the tides in
different places upon each portion of the earth. A correct knowledge
of the law of fluids will at once demonstrate the cause of the whole
phenomenon. And it is by understanding the natural tendency of

246            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
fluids, and that of all other substances, when subiected to a centrifugal force, that the present explanation of the phenomenon will become
established beyond the possibility of refutation.
Thus, at the epoch of the termination of the sandstone system, and
wihen the elements had become thus modified, the water was agitated
by such wonderful tides that fossils of every description were carried
by it and deposited in the clefts and crevices of mountains, not exCepting those of the Andes. And as was before described, the equilibriumn had been nearly destroyed by the sublimation of particles
composing the elements, by which operation the exterior became unequal in pressure to the expansive force of the internal. The result
was some of the most mighty and inconceivable agitations of the interior molten mass, the noise of which would have shattered to atoms
the complicated organization of man. The convulsions that occurred
were so immense as to present the appearance of utter destruction,
and it would have seemed that the materials of the whole earth had
experienced one universal clash in an instant of time.  And it was
by these paroxysms, which were altogether indescribable, that the
crust of the earth was broken, and inconceivable masses of stone and
molten mineral substances, together with the remains of organic beings previously upon the surface, were thrown to an immense height.
The sudden upheaving broke stratum after stratum into great and minute masses, while other strata were bent and twisted into every possible position, exposing trap, basalt, granite, sandstone, shale, &c.,
which were apparently deranged and confused in the most indescribable manner.
At the very moment this terrific occurrence took place, a process
commenced by which the great mass of lava thrown from the interior,
conjoined with the previous solution of lime and coral reefs, became
soon segregated and condensed; and being attractive to the carbon
generally pervading the earth at this time, the result was a condensation of a great portion of the whole mass into the carboniferous limestone and coal formations. The element carbon, which had been
previously associated with, became by this process disunited firom,
other particles in the atmosphere, to a great extent.
This resulted, again, in a modification of the composition of water;
the result of which, again, was an ascension of the primary elements
to associate with the envelope formed by the new and more congenial
atmosphere of the earth.
Mountains that were then thrown from the interior, have since been

named by allegorical terms, each of which has a signification that will
hereafter be explained. Among the mountains then developed, are
the Altay, Ural, and Himalayah mountains in Asia; the Alps, upor
which Switzerland is now located; the Apennines in Italy, and the
Pyrenees between France and Spain; —also the beautiful chain of
mountains that now borders the Euphrates, with other mountains in
7arious other portions in Asia (which will hereafter be described); —also the Grampian mountains in Scotland, a small line of which extends nearly to the national line that divides what is now known as
Russia firon the other European nations;-also the Andes of South
America, which yet answer as vents to relieve the internal heat abounding in the liquid, fiery mass, which still constitutes several thousand
miles of the earth's internal substance.  The Rocky mountains had
been in existence for many ages previous. The Alleganies became
enlarged, and there was a great division of the earth into what are
now known as the eastern and western hemispheres, or continents.
A quarter of the earth made its appearance at this epoch —a greater
quantity than had been before manifested, owing to the water being
still elevated, being increased in bulk, decreased in density, and approaching in composition nearer to that which now exists.
Thus the world and all things therein contained became essentially
changed; and then was the commencement of a new Era.  And
these occurrences established those divisions and features of the
earth that have not as yet become mraterially changed.
The water then became very greatly modified, insomuch that it
became suitable to give birth to more perfect organizations.  The
atmosphere encompassing the whole globe became correspondingly
perfected, so as to sustain new orders of terrestrial and marine productions that soon followed as ultimate results of what had preceded.
Seas, lakes, and rivers, became now the circulating media through
various parts of the world, transporting particles and substances from
place to place. Though these possessed less power than the waters
before existing, there was no diminution of action to perform the
same work that the same element had for many ages before been accomplishing.  The water acted upon substances, and deposited particles, generating motion and life in all the gelatinous compositions
that were properly situated to receive it. And it gave fertility to the
inland portions, and to places which were previously concealed beneath its overflowing waves, but which now constitute most beautiful'
meadows and extensive territories, —whose capabilities of unfolding:

248            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
such beauties as they now display, would not have been believed or
imagined by man, had it been possible for man to exist during the
development of these portions.
Thus earth, water, and atmosphere, became correspondingly perfected; and their united action was such, that all formations which
resulted as an ultimate of prior species, must necessarily have an
nrganization comparatively exalted and refined.
~ 43. This, then, is the period, after the lapse of incalculable
ages, when dry land became visible. And after the inconceivable
movements in the earth, the water, and the atmosphere, the equilibrium was re-established, and all was again rendered calm and quiet.
The earth contracted, and the water, becoming less dense, expanded to
a greater volume.  The atmosphere became fitted for the ascension
of ultimate particles.  Yet carbon was existing to a great extent,
while oxygen was almost entirely undeveloped, and nitrogen formed
a great portion of the air, neutralizing the action of the other elements.  For had it not been that the tendencies, either of carbon or
of oxygen, had been counteracted by an associated element, all things
would have instantly become inflamed, and would have been dissolved
with great rapidity. But the equilibrium thus established, rendered
the atmosphere congenial, and suitable to, perform its uses.
And the aspect of things generally, manifested the dawning of a
new Era. It plainly indicated the adaptation of all substances to
each other, and to the whole agglomerated Mass.  It clearly revealed
the development and preparation of substances for more perfect organizations, and also showed the establishment of more equal and
harmonious conditions than could have existed without the change.
Thus were all Nature and all her elements, laws, and principles,
quieted into repose for the steady and successive creations of new
species of land and sea developments.
And this is the era when Motion transcends Life and becomes
Sensation,-and when forms transcend plants and become substantial species of animals:-and this is termed by geologists, the "Carboniferous Formation."  For the avertebrated and osseous fish species now progressed to higher degrees of perfection. And it is most
tranquillizing to the mind to contemplate the development of distinct
types and infallible indices of higher forms, and to meditate upon the
perfect mutual adaptations of all things to each other, and to the pro

gressive unfolaing of higher forms. which Nature indicates with evidences that can not be misconceived or misapprehended.
All things had been thrown into a chaotic condition, the confusion
of which to some minds would appear altogether to exclude the idea
of any order or law as being concerned in the creation of the world.
And many noble and enlightened minds have endeavored on such
grounds to refute the reasonings of those who have investigated the
sublime workings of Nature, and who, by observing an unlimited concatenation of causes, have endeavored to establish some orderly system, so that all subordinate things might be conceived of by analogy.
The opinions of geologists are in some particulars very dissimilar
and very incorrect.  But geologists are nevertheless worthy of the
approbation of the world for endeavoring to unfold truths that might
lead to a proper comprehension of the origin of the earth. And I
do not therefore feel impressed to contradict any of their theories or
propositions, but merely to state the truth, in order that that which
they have not discovered may be correctly inferred from the evidences presented in this course of generalization, the basis of which
they will not dispute.
They have considered this present period of stratification, the third
of the general division, including the primary. But I am distinctly
impressed that Sensation did not before this period become an unfolded principle of the original law. And as the earth has now
assumed established divisions, and as the water and atmosphere have
ascended to a higher state of refinement, this is the epoch when types
were ushered into being, which ascend undisturbed to the organization of mankind. And, according to a previous declaration, the
inconceivable periods of time that the world with all the forms it had
developed, had existed before this era, constituted one unimaginable
nig ht or " evening," —the unfolding of which manifests new beauties,
even the "morning " of a new existence.  Therefore " TIE EVENING AND THE MORNING WERE THE FIRST DAY."
This is a remarkable era in the geological history of the earth's
formation. Although it is impossible for geologists to determine upon
the exact chronological period of these occurrences, from any indications which Nature presents, yet natural appearances have served as
a guide to a general inference. But a truthful conclusion has not as
yet been established.
Dry land now appears.  The earth is divided into two great continents, and the rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans, commence their

Ceaseless operations, performing the work of decomposition and sedi.
mentary segregation.  The earth now assumes the rudimental stage
of its f6ture development, insomuch that all things now manifested
put forth evident indications of a far more glorious era.
Before this period, the earth was apparently "without form, and
void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep:" for the encompassing robe had not been illuminated by the degree of light which now
dispersed the utter darkness.  This was accomplished by a change of
the atmosphere, which in becoming more refined, became also more
susceptible to the action of the sun's rays, and thus clothed the earth
in a more grand and sublime robe.  The earth was before this without form or order, comparatively, because the present era unfolds the
superior beauty, and harmony, and order, that the internal elements
were designed to produce.  Therefore order becomes now a conspicuous indication of Nature.  Animated forms now dwell upon the
dry land, whereas before, no living or creeping thing existed upon
the earth's bosom.  The change of the earth, water, and atmosphere,
was a transformation from that which was before seemingly a fountain of chaotic materials.
All the evidences which geologists' and naturalists have brought
forward as proving the exact conditions and circumstances under
which the coal formation was produced, do not in reality convey a
correct idea of the causes that produced these great carbonaceous
deposites. In many portions of the world, coal is found to be resting upon the primary coating of the earth; while in other places it
lies upon the various strata of the transition rocks, such as the quartz
and slate, and especially the limestone.  These formations also develop ironstone, limestone, sandstone, and various other kinds of
deposites. Some of these enter into the composition of coal itself,
while others form intervening strata, between the layers of coal. It
is evident from this that the substance of the ironstone and other compositions, had a peculiar affinity for the carbon of the atmosphere;
and this being thus attracted to and associated with the former, the
whole consequently became condensed into the formation of which
the coal is a prominent part.  Also various parts of the sea-beds
had not been subjected to the same amount of abrasion as others;
and thus they became proper receptacles for the formation of the coal
and the stratifications that are associated therewith. In those places,
dry land became visible; the result of which was an active gelati

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               265
nous development, occurring from the assimilation of light and heat
with the previously decomposed vegetable substances, and which still
possessed the principle of vitality. And being subjected to such
favorable circumstances, a lively impregnation was the consequence,
the action of which reorganized the parts that before had been
assimilated.
~ 44. Therefore vegetable formations became very thickly disseminated upon the portions of land that were thus raised from  the
depths of the sea. Immense masses were thus formed, and trees
towered to a great height, the species of which are now entirely extinct.  These were existing in various parts where moisture prevailed, and where there was an abundant supply of the requisite eleinents.  And so exceedingly fertile were these vegetable portions,
that the plants, in their rapid growth, extracted the strength of each
other, and became prostrated; and decomposition followed as a natural result. This decomposition formed heavy beds of moss; and
these constantly collected substances of like nature, as the latter were
wafted from their locations by the excessive tides; and thus immense
masses of vegetable substance were formed.  These gradually sank
below the surface upon the shale and limestone substances which
formed suitable foundations for them.  Being thus below their original level, these masses formed a basis for the deposition of other disintegrated and floating particles (of which the solution of lime and
shale formed a great portion), and thus in process of time would be
formed an overlying stratum of shale.
It is well known among chemists that plants emit oxygen, and
attract and assimilate with their composition, nitrogen, carbon, and
other such mineral elements as constitute a part of their organized
forms.  This fact applies to vegetables now existing; but it gives
but a faint idea of the nature of the vegetable productions that existed during the era under present contemplation.  They were, it is
true, forms suitable for the transformation of inherent elements into
the atmosphere by reflux, but they were still more perfectly adapted
to assimilate with their own composition a very large amount of carbon,-which in reality entered almost purely into their forms, and
became an ingredient dissimilar to any now known upon the face of
the earth.  Their food therefore was carbon; their soil, the progressed, gelatinous, vegetable decompositions of the primitive ages.
Hence, when these masses were thus decayed and condensed, and

2$2            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
finally transformed by the action of elements, they constituted the
carboniferous, or coal formations.
Geologists have accumulated the remains of plants that have been
found in the intervening strata of quartz, lime, and shale, which occur.
in the coal formation: and thus it is proved beyond the possibility of
a doubt, that as each of these immense bodies of moss became concealed by a coating of the dissolved substances that were conveyed
by the waters and deposited over them, so the latter deposites became
in like manner the receptacles of other floating substances, like unto
the gelatinous, living, germinating substances that were fi.st deposited.  And as these collected upon the strata, the action of the
carbon, light, and heat, soon resulted in their pregnation.  These
then germinated, and produced an immense growth of vegetation.
And by the same process as was observed in the previous mass, luxuriant growth, assimilation of carbon, decay, and condensation,
occurred in the succeeding masses also. And they became likewise
the foundations of immense beds of moss, receiving similar substances as drifted and deposited by the tides, with occasionally a few
infusoria and sea-shells: and the whole settled, decayed, and condensed, as before, forming an immense mass of carbon. This, by
the action of other existing circumstances, became converted into the
substanlce of another stratum of coal.
These vegetables would not have become transformed into the
composition of coal, had other conditions, other elements, or other
circumstances existed, or the same as nlow exist upon the earth's surface.  Thus one stratum after another was produced; and the process would have continued until the present day, had it not been that
the substances in solution which were then abundant throughout the
waters, became exhausted, and had not the elements, the conditions,
and all things, become so changed as to render it no longer possible
for the same process to be in operation.
Thus was the coal formation consummated; and thus were its
intermediate strata required and adapted- designed-as a basis upon
which other strata of coal might be deposited and perfected.  If
these intervening strata of shale, limestone, ironstone, and sandstone,
had not settled upon each succeeding stratum of carbonaceous matter, the substance of coal would not have been in existence, especially in its present form.  Therefore it was positively necessary that
the solutions of which the intervening strata are formed, should first
exist; that the water should perform its circulating functions (the

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                2~53
result of which was the deposition of previously suspended particles),
and thait the general surrounding elements and conditions should be
thus favorable, so that all conjoined might produce and condense
both the vegetable mass and its concealing stratum,-and that one
might become the useful substance for Man, and the other the basis
upon which the former might be formed.  And if these things had not
all existed, a substance like unto coal would not have been known to
the inhabitants of the earth.
Coal, therefore, is considered the first of the secondary formations.
And here I would remark that it is impossible for me to accede to
all the classifications made by geologists in either of the kingdoms;
but so far as classes and species have been designated by appropriate
terms, it is proper that the nomenclature should be preserved, instead
of substituting in its place terms and phraseology not altogether
familiar to the scientific reader.
The coal era presents indications important as respects a proper
comprehension of geology, and also furnishes important hints in
regard to the process of creation.  For the withdrawing from the
atmosphere of the carbon which has entered into the composition of
coal, and into the carbonate of lime, must of necessity produce a
great change in the atmosphere, and consequently in the earth and
water.  For as carbon had before supplied a great portion of the
atmosphere, the absence of this element must now of necessity be
supplied by ascending gaseous particles of a different nature.  And
this must inevitably work a great change in the strata above the coal,
and upon the dry land and its productions, and the water also must
become changed into a different combination of substances, such as
had not before ascended to higher positions.  The change was gradual and imperceptible from the commencement to the consummation
of the coal era: but when this period was closed, the whole change
was comparatively great; and the elements were fitted to give life,
and form, and texture, to the inhabitants of the sea and land, of altogether a' different character from any before existing; and these
ascended from lower types, and assumed a state of progression corresponding to all else existing in sea, earth, and atmosphere.
The chain can not be broken as extending from the primary formation to the coal era; from the first to the ultimate element that
surrounded the earth, and from the first organization possessing Life,
to the full development of the principle of Sensation. For the very
moment the existence of the first is established, that very moment,

254            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
according to the eternal law of progressive development, the future
unfolding of the latter is rendered certain.
~ 45. It is not proper that anything should be considered sacred
and holy, merely because we have lost the period of its origin among
the revolutions of innumerable ages.  Nor should an enthusiastic
veneration be cherished for the idea of the creation of anything,
when in reality the term " creation" has no signification, inasmuch as
the origin of every form, principle, and substance, in being, is owing
to some )rior cause.  And it should be understood that cause and
effect are eternally inseparable; that is, inseparable from the commencement of all causes to the accomplishment of all effects; and
thus one age or period of eternity is comprehended within the cycle
of one eternal Cause, and one eternal Effect.
Array no arguments, therefore, against the truthful and magnificent
doctrine of progressive development.  For if this is overthrown,
that very moment all laws and principles become annihilated, and
Cause and Effect can no longer be considered as the agents of
breathing into being the grand and sublime manifestations that beautify the bosom of a tender and caressing NATURE! Upon the immutable foundation of this law of progression, rest all arguments and
conclusions that can be legitimately drawn from any material or external substance that exists in any department of the earth or the
Universe. Yet if there should be any inclination to dispute the foregoing classifications of the geological and organic developments, let
the objection not be arrayed against isolated and detached phrases,
sentences, or propositions; but let the attack be at the BASIS —the
FOUNDATION on which rests all that has been and shall be said concerning those indestructible truths which are greater than man can
comprehend or duly appreciate.
The transformation of elements, therefore, into new forms and
combinations, becomes a matter of necessity from the sequestration
of that almost all-pervading element, carbon, into other substances.
And this is therefore a conspicuous and decided change, and therefore a new Era. And the description of the vegetable and animal
productions of this period which is soon to follow, will manifest more
distinctly the truthfulness of this proposition.
During the process of this and previous formations, various metallic substances, whose distinct characteristics designate them as min

erals, became deposited in various parts where constant segregation
was taking place.  The first of these is tin.  This lies nearer the
primary than most of the others. Subsequent to this, lead, zinc, and
copper, were developed.  These are interspersed in various strata
bearing a close relation to the coal, mountain limestone, and new red
sandstone; while silver and gold are among the accompaniments of
iron-stone, which is found in the carboniferous and in many other
subdivisions of the secondary formation.
It has been supposed by chemists that the atmosphere is composed
of properly elementary substances.  This is true; but gaseous elements could only have originated from the minerals of the earth.
They are therefore ascended molecules, which may be considered as
the perfection of mineral bodies like unto those which still remain
concealed in the crust of the earth. Therefore the substances known
as carbonate of lime and coal, must have received their main component ingredients from the atmosphere that then enveloped the earth.
And carbonic acid being so exceedingly abundant, this rendered the
earth fertile, which yielded flowerless vegetation in great luxuriance.
And it is a truth too conspicuous to be misconceived, that, from
the earliest vegetable forms to the present era, there is a general and
progressive ascension of each species to higher and corresponding
forms. This, however, would be more susceptible of demonstration
if the kind of vegetation that was produced during the coal formation
could now be seen among the strata of that period.  But the plants
of that period partook greatly of the nature of the equisetaceae, which
were very easily decomposed by water and exposure to a tropical
temperature. A genus of this class is existing at this present time.
The vegetable productions of this period varied from the moss to
the stupendous coniferoe-trees that then existed very extensively in
marshes, and on land where warmth and moisture constantly existed.
And the sigillaria and monocotiledons then existed and flourished
very extensively.
The plants of the first species existing, were composed of a gelatinous cellular tissue, whose fibres and complex membrane constituted
the medium of life, where the power of assimilation and reproduction
was seated. From these came mosses; from these the ferns; and
from these the coniferae, which were an imperfect type of the pines
that now exist upon the earth's surface.  Some of these trees were
exceedingly large and beautiful.  Their altitude was from twenty to

sixty feet.  Their limbs were straight and fern-like, and their leaves
bore a resemblance to those of the palm. They approached nearer
to the pine than any others then existing.  Some of the plants were
flowerless, while others brought forth flowers of a peculiar and variegated appearance.  Of these there were several species, the highest
of which represented the palm, and the lowest were in character near
the endogenous plants, which grow by a deposition of particles upon
file inner surface.  The flowering plants brought forth a seed-vessel
containing seeds; and there were few plants existing that had seeds
with two lobes, because the exogenous species were not fully developed until the close of the carboniferous era.
The various kinds of animal forms that had previously existed,
became now entirely extinct; while the molluscs, cephalopods, &c.,
were reproduced in abundance; and these, together with all classes
of the univalve, bivalve, and multivalve shells, continued their upward
tendencies to higher species of the same classes. The spirifer is entirely extinct; while the terebratula, productus, and others of like
nature, continued in great abundance through all the ages of the
present era.  The seas were extensively inhabited by species of
scorpion and saurian fishes, slightly exemplified in the sturgeon now
existing, which in its embryonic state has no vertebral portions, but
rather a gelatinous cord that assumes subsequently the form of vertebrae. And such characterized all the species of fish then traversing
the watery domain. Therefore osseous and unosseous fishes existed
to a great extent; and also the plants, both of the sea and land, were
such only as could have flourished under the existing conditions.
These inhabitants of the watery depths were very differently organized from those existing during the previous periods.  They, like
the plants, possessed a vascular tissue; and this is manifested by the
conjoined boxed scales and the interwoven network that were very
much existing upon the class of sauroid fishes that inhabited the seas
at this period.  And the plants manifested the same by their exogenous nature, which is distinguished by the concentric or spiral
arrangement of particles from their outward coating.  Still, cotiledons were not existing, except the monocotiledons, which sustained
an intermediate position between the cryptogamia and the dicotiledons; which are the highest type of the vegetable kingdom.
~ 46. The fishes being progressed from those previously formed,
whose structure was wholly cellular, possessed both the cellular and

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                257
vascular tissues,-which established imperfect serous and mucous
surfaces, upon which sensation must inevitably exist. Sensatown thus
became an establishecd principle, though it was as yet but imperfectly
developed from Motion and Life. Consequently inclinations must
have been the result. These developed instinct, or living desire.
This is the first principle that corresponds to thought. Therefore the
Motion, Life, and Sensation, that these sauroid fishes possessed, represent the same principles far more perfected, the highest degree of which
corresponds to the principle of Intelligence. Thus the inhabitants of
the seas at this era, manifested for the first time the unfolding of the
law of Motion, whereby a more perfect exaltation of the same principle could be naturally inferred.
So likewise with the land plants: the cellular were Jlowcrless, consisting of mosses, ferns, fungi, and others, which corresponded to the
one-membrane and radiating nature of the first animal species. And
as these plants gradually became unfolded, developing the exogenous
form, they brought forth beautiful flowers —an indication corresponding to that of Sensation, and pointing to the perfected condition of,
the vegetating principle. Thus the plants revealed Life, and the:
fishes Sensation; but inasmuch as their forms were yet imperfect, so
likewise were their endowments. But the chain is unbroken between
the previous and present existing species, in each kingdom.
It must be observed that Nature's developments are exceedingly
dissimilar in form, essence, and quality, as the conditions change,
both as regards the temperature of the climate, the location, and the
influences of incidental causes. Thus dissimilar forms were presented,
which it is almost impossible to arrange in perfect order, because the
time and circumstances are beyond natural calculation.  Hence the
things that are existing during this era, are in many portions of the
earth rather unlike, and seemingly disconnected.  But let it not be
forgotten that there is a correspondence between all general developments and the specific causes that produce them. For, as was established in the key, " all things are constantly assuming forms; and
these are in accordance with the existing exciting causes."
The experience of the ichthyologist can be appealed to in proof of
the existence of the species of fishes that were in being during the
carboniferous era, especially so far as his knowledge extends into the
reality of these creations, from his observations upon the vestiges still
indicating the classes and species then inhabiting the waters.  The
botanist can arrange in an order of general development, the originale

vegetable productions, up to the classes and species of the present
era; and geologists are acquainted with the order of formation of
which I speak.
But the close of the carboniferous era is evidently a great consummation as affecting the earthy, mineral, vegetable, and animal forms.
And all are modified and brought to a degree of development superior
to what was manifested in any prior age; and hence they constitute
one of the most perfect and decided links in the general chain of
progression.
Many parts of the dry land were overshadowed by beautiful palms,
ferns, and sigillarias; and the atmosphere, which was active in generating rain, contributed greatly to their luxuriance of growth. And
the mountains that now were in some parts yielding mosses and other
species of vegetation, gave Nature a very splendid and beautiful appearance-more so in some localities than exists at this present age
on the earth's surface.
The change in the atmosphere and water, occurring from the consumption of carbonic acid gas, from recombinations of the main external elements, &c., now rendered the previous equilibrium of the
interior and exterior somewhat disturbed. External pressure was'diminished and became inadequate to counterbalance the expansion
-of the igneous mass within. Consequently, Nature was in danger of.in instantaneous convulsion.
The face of the earth at this time would have appeared to the eye
of man, as if Nature were clothed in a sombre mantle, and had sunk'into a death-like sleep. No busy insects would have diverted the
mind with their musical hum; no birds were flitting through the air,
or perching upon the branches; and all forests and marshes looked'disconsolate and forsaken. No living being could have been found'with whom communications or pleasurable emotions could have been'exchanged.  There was nothing existing which the mind of man'would not have looked upon as being altogether uncongenial, not-'withstanding Nature yielded forth her best forms that could have been
developed tinder such circumstances. But her previous living, active,energies, were now sunk into repose. All interior beauties were con-,cealed, for the want of some more energetic forces to call them forth.
All conditions were seemingly immoveable, and some more active energies were required to set in motion those paralyzed substances and
rforms that spread over the earth. Darkness was again upon the face

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               2b9
of the deep; and the waters were moved with ceaseless agitationwith frightful and uncontrolled waves that almost lashed the mountainrops.  It was now evident that inherent forces were moving upon the
face of the waters, causing inconceivable excitement to abound
throughout their domain. The equilibrium had been destroyed.
The water and atmosphere were unequal in pressure to the interior
expansion, and a change must inevitably ensue.  Consequently the
igneous fluid assumed impetuous motions at various parts of the interior of the earth's crust. Violent tremblings and paroxysms occurred,
followed by wonderful breathings of lava from the Andes and other
mountains; but this could not restore the equilibrium.  Therefore
internal elements continued to rush together and recede with inconceivable agitation.  The result was an expansion of interior particles
that shook the earth in some parts to its very centre, upheaving the
rocks primarily formed, together with trap, slate, shale, sandstone,
and also various strata of the carboniferous formation.  These were
turned and twisted from their original beds into perpendicular and
inclined positions, several miles of the previously-formed strata being
broken and contorted into every conceivable shape.
The surface of the earth subsequently presented a very different
appearance from what it had at any previous time.  Portions of the
land that were below the water, were raised to a great height above
it, and other portions were correspondingly depressed.  Mountains
and prominences that were previously formed, were now broken
asunder in various parts, and their positions and appearances became
very much changed, insomuch that new valleys and coves were
formed, which now constitute the beds and borders of large seas.
Chains of mountains in Asia, in Scotland, and Switzerland, became
now permanently established.  Among those in Asia was Mount
Ararat, which before could only be seen a little above the surface of
the water.  The convulsion of Nature was thus universal, though it
affected some parts more than others, because vents previously existed in some mountains.
~ 47. Tile evolving of internal elements soon quieted the agitation
of the water and atmosphere, the density of which became very much
changed, and both were rendered equal to the expansive tendency
of the interior elements; and thus the equilibritmn  was again restored.
The results of the convulsion were, another shrinking of the crust of
the earth toward its centre, a reorganization of the watery element, a

260            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
dissipation of still more of the carbon'in the air, and a replacing of
the same by oxygen. Thus oxygen, nitrogen, and a small portion
of carbon, together with the particles composing the water that were
constantly associating themselves with the ultimate elements, composed the atmospheric envelope of the globe.
The earth soon generated new compositions upon its surface as a
result of the emission from the interior substances.  Thus a new
stratification was formed; and this again is subdivided by geologists
into three distinct substances, which are all apparent in some portions
of the previous stratification.
It is well known that the limestone contains a great amount of
carbon; and this reveals its affinity for the carboniferous formation.
And the quartz and other substances combining with the metal iron,
and this with oxygen, the whole produced a new combination, which
is termed the iron-stone (oxyde of iron), and the magnesian limestone,
- all of which are generally covered by heavy beds of marl. And
it is a well-ascertained truth in chemistry, that each of the original
elements contained in the composition of the earth (which are supposed to be fifty-five in number), combines variously with others by
chemical affinity; and thus compounds change, presenting corresponding changes in form, appearance, and properties. And it is by
the process of combination and recombination alone that all forms,
from the angular to the circular, during all their processes of crystallization, constantly manifest the same general law of progressive
ascension, insomuch that new and higher forms and compositions are
constantly being produced, though elements and essential qualities
remain unchanged. Therefore the formation of the new red sandstone only unfolds a new substancie, which resulted from the previous
occurrence, and from the entire change of the water and atmosphere
surrounding and acting upon the earth at this time.
Thus the whole Mass became changed. The earth became less
in diameter, the water less in density and bulk, the atmosphere
lighter and more refined, —and all things were equally and permanently changed into new forms and compositions. And the elements
were now prepared to bring forth new substances, both in the sea
and on the land. New laws, new principles and elements, were
now putting forth their energies, all of which must result in an entire
change of the earth's creations. Nature was revived from a long
sleep. New light and new beauties were now to be breathed into

existence. For the firmament  was above, and divided the waters
from the waters, and thus comparative darkness was dissipated. And
new things, concerning which more will hereafter be mentioned, were
now in embryo for ultimate perfection.  Therefore, what was before
3aid concerning this era, is now entirely verified: for everything has
now assumed a different character and condition from what had existed
in any other era in the creation of the earth. Therefore the expression is rendered clear and forcible, that "the evening and the morning
were the second day."
So far as the researches of geologists have been successful in exploring the fossil remains of this age, they give a general conception
of the real formations, though these were far more extensive than
discoveries yet made have indicated. The prevailing idea deduced
from geological appearances concerning this era, is that fishes and
saurians were more extensive than any other forms. And it has also
been supposed that the original forms and species of land-plants
were entirely destroyed at the close of the carboniferous formation.
Then again, the belief has been generally acceded to, that the lepidodendron still exists as an ultimate of the lower species; and it
is known that ferns, mosses, and fucoides, flourished during this era,
though not very extensively. And the marl beds have been very
properly supposed to be the result of a great collection of the lower
orders of the molluscs: for they are apparently masses of shells,
each bed of which represents slightly all the types of the molluscs
which are formed from the crystallized carbonate of lime. And
these beds have yielded a great variety of the lower species of
mosses, these never ascending to the higher ferns or the c~iferae
which represent the pine of the present day.
The plants were neither very thrifty nor abundant. Few flowers
were existing; for the classes of plants that thrived most during this
era were the  lore substantial land and marine plants, and there were
not so many of the flowering and tender plants that were existing in
such abundance during the last formation.  The only progress, therefore, which we see in the vegetable kingdom, consists in the devel6pment of a more substantial class, which the pine, oak, birch, and
maple now existing, represent.
* By way of note the clairvoyant here remarked, that although the word shamaya
(heaven), called " firmament" in Genesis i. 8, was in the plural number, its meaning
was simply the atmosphere; and that such was the only signification of the words
S' heaven" and " firmament," as occurring in the primitive history of the creation.

But the wonder of geologists has been increased by the discovery
zf trackts, apparently those of immense lizards and birds, and also
of the tortoise.  And from collections of the fossils, the species that
were existing have in several instances been correctly inferred.
It is not necessary that I should give a description of the ammonites and calamites that now have changed their nature and order of
being, in proportion to the change of elements and circumstances.
For these had imperceptibly changed their forms, habits, and constitutions.  It must not be supposed that the order of progression was
interfered with by a sudden transition of any class or species to
another; for this is unlike any principle or phenomenon in Nature.
Although Nature manifests at periods violent paroxysms, these de
not disturb the order of existence; but as all other things have
ascended, and the equilibrium is destroyed between the interior and
exterior of the whole mass, a universal convulsion results in only a
static condition.  It does not change the order and harmony of
established laws, though it modifies exceedingly those which previously acted upon the forms existing upon the land and in the water,
and this modification only fulfils the previous requirements of the
various kingdoms in Nature. And thus no law or principle is altered;
but the whole operation presents a steadily-ascending order of de
grees, from the lowest type in existence to the highest.
Geologists have classified the species that have been discovered,
but have not succeeded in discovering the species intermediate
between one class and another, or any cause why new forms should
now be created. But in unfolding the indications which this formation presents, it is not proper that I should notice all the living forms
then existing in the animal kingdom.  But I will give a description
of the most prominent species, from the lowest saurian to the highest
type determined upon by geologists. The evidences to sustain the
description given are to be found among the classifications already
made, and in the existing general conditions that called into action
new energies which must have resulted in the creation of forms of
altogether a different class and nature from those of any previous
formation.
~ 4S. A proper knowledge of the kind of animals existing during this
period, depends upon a knowledge of the density of the atmosphere.
As its density at the present time has been correctly ascertained, at
least so far as the experiments (which have been limited) have been





## p. 263 (#291) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   263
adequate to decide, I speak comparatively of the pressure of the air
upon forms and things existing during the process of tile new red
n. dstone formation.  The whole weight of the atmosphere, that
equalled, together with the pressure of the water, the expansive force
of the interior of the earth, was thirty-seven quadrillions, four hundred
and six trillions, three hundred and seventy billions tons; or more
than thirty-seven pounds to the square inch.  Therefore, from this
extreme density can be inferred the order and habits of the land
animals.
The ichthyosaurus is among the first formns of this period that have
attracted attention, especially as its spinal column represents the ossification of a previous gelatinous substance, insomuch that it is not altogether vertebrated, only near the neck and extremity; the centre of
the back being entirely ossified.  It bears the character of the saurian, or lizard; is slightly represented by tile shark, and more by the
modern crocodile.  Its nature was carnivorous.  It could live either
in or out of the water; and this can be inferred firom the shape of
its thorax and posterior sternum.  This indicates that it possessed
an adipose branchme, which served as a respiratory organ.  T4lerefore, it could both subsist under water, and inhale the existing element constituting the air, which was carbon, nearly counterbalanced
by oxygen.
This animal sustains a position between tile previous saurian and
the lizard proper; for the lizard is represented in the following
order, which the plesiorsaurus represents.  This being a higher class
than the previous, its habits were a little different, but only in reference to its element, which was water.  And being exceedingly carnivorous, it preyed upon the lower order of fishes, and other infusorial productions.
The following order is represented in the megalosairits.  This
animal (for it should be termed such) is very different in forin and
disposition from the lower orders.  For an account of the remains
of this animal, whereby the following description may be tendered
probable, I would refer to the investigations of geologists, especially
as these afford the only evidence that the mind can now receive
concerning it. This represents the fully vertebrated animal.  It also
has a very long and large body, with peculiarly formed ribs, which
indicate greatly the motion generally connected with the locomotion
of the whole body.  It also has two legs, which have been termed
wings, friom their spread and complex form.  It had also two sets,





## p. 264 (#292) ############################################


2G6             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of fins; these being connected with the side and top of the body,
and so constructed as to give great force and velocity of motion.  It
also possessed great power of contraction, insomuch that it could
raise itself nearly perpendicular from  ten to fifteen feet.  The legs
or wings served to direct its motions and gave it great force in attacking other species.  This animal has been termed a lizard, and
would still have been considered such, if it had not had a tortoiseshell-like coating.
This order is modified in the _lcithcosauruss: and this differs in
habit only in that it is herbivorous.  Its form is very long, and full
at the head, being, so far as the latter particular is concerned, slightly
represented in the young whale of the _present day.  Having legs,
and power of great motion, it travelled very extensively over portions
of the dry land; and the ferns constituted its peculiar food.
An order of animals that associated greatly with this species, but
which was very differently formed, is termed the lIastodonsaurus.
It possessed the general habits and disposition of the latter, with the
exception that it approached nearer to the digitigrade.
The color of the first animal was dark, with an intermixture of red
and green, the coating being hard and turtle-like. The second was
entirely black, the surface being a little more elastic.  The third
possessed a very rough and complex coating, hard and shark-like.
The fourth had a surface of more ordinary appearance, rather elastic,
and corresponding nearly to that of the whale. The body of the last
animal corresponded nearly to that of the elephant, with the exception of its being very dark and hairy; and its length varied (in the
various species, from  the lowest to the highest) from five to sixtysix feet.
The highest type of the latter class is termed the Iguanodon7,whose enormous organization has been the cause of much wonder
and speculation. But inasmuch as inference can not at all times be
correct, the nature and disposition of the Iguanodon have not as yet
been properly understood. Its class was the highest on earth during
the deposition of the new red sandstone; and it was superior to all
others in size and power.
Thus the present era represents a progressed condition of the previous sea-tribes, and of the vegetable productions. For each had
imperceptibly assumed its present condition by virtue of the change
experienced by the whole earth, water, and atmosphere.  The lower
species still swarmed in the seas in great abundance, while the lapse

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                265
of innumerable ages had produced the gigantic forms that existed
upon the land, and while the lower vegetable productions could not
by any possible means preserve their order and species. For it is
known that, at the close of the carboniferous era, many plants became
extinct.  But the substances which entered into their composition
still existed, and these were unfolded in the pr-duction of the ascending orders of the vegetable kingdom.
Motion was first existing: and as forms assumed a proper state,
Life became visible, until at the close of the last era, Sensation became imperfectly developed. And in this period, Life and Sensation
have unfolded new principles, new forms, and new dispositions. For
the animals of each class are more perfectly organized, and each
class unfolds new attributes of Life and Sensation, insomuch that
when the Iguanodon, with its disposition, is compared with the first
forms of the radiata, the analogy is so completely lost that the human
mind can not conceive that there is the most distant relation existing
between them.
However disconnected the order of creation appears to the particularizing, mind, this can not alter the general truth, that the whole
displays an harmonious adaptation of parts, the succession of which
represents the orders and degrees of creation.  For it was proved in
the key that particulars are not to be depended upon as leading to
general truths in respect to the laws, principles, and developments,
of the Universe.
~ 49. The orders of animals that have been described, will admit
of several subdivisions; and there is a species among them  higher
than any yet discovered. At the close of the previous formation, the
fish became a generally-abounding class; and on the opening of the
present, the turtle and bird are in order developed.  The class of
animals known as the Irruanodon, has several species.  The highest
of these represents the Rhinocerosaurus, and also the Hippopotamus
of the present day. Some of these in nature were digitigrade; whalelike in habit, and elephant-like in disposition. Above the class of
lizard-like forms, there is a description of flying ornithlosaurus (pterodactyle).  These have two legs, with very wide-spread and cotnplex
feet, and a large and rather low body; and they were very ferocious.
The lower orders of these have been discovered by geologists from
their impressions left upon the sandstone rocks during the middle and
near the close of the present era.  Some of these, and also of the





## p. 266 (#294) ############################################


266            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
turtle-birds, have likewise left their tracks upon some inclined shores,
having been apparently the frequenters of the waters. An inferior animal, of a species between the turtle and bird, was of a bat-like form,
and of these the indications are remaining upon the higher strata.
The marl-beds represent more of the previously-described animals
than any prior formation.  The cause of this is, that these animals
existed a long time before the formation of the marl-beds, but became
changed and partly extinct at the close of the latter and on the commencement of the oolite period.  Geologists, therefore, have discovered the fossil remains of these animals where they were left at the
expiration of their period of existence.  The largest animal represented an enormous snake-lizard, and slightly some of the lower animals of the historical period.  The largest birds slightly represented
the Ostrich, but more the Congener, being an imperfect type of the
bird creation.  There are several classes of these, ascending from
the Iguana to the Ornithosaurus, or highest class.  And the discovery of certain fossil remains confirms the existence of these distinct
species, each of which was of enormous bulk and stature.
The whole animal creation at this period properly corresponds to two
distinct classes -the lizard-turtle, and the turtle-bird; neither of which
is, to any extent, visible to us in the animal creation of the present
period. The lower classes were exceedingly carnivorous, and the
higher were herbivorous.  The constitutions of the latter correspond
to the vegetable productions of the earth; while the lower possessed
the gross forms ordinarily accompanying the carnivorous habit. And
it is to be remarked that there was no anatomical structure among
these classes at this period which was not either partially or wholly
vertebrated; and that their main bones were internally filled with a
heavy marrow, and covered with a periosteum.  Therefore we see
that the land plants and animals of this period are such as were typified at the close of the carboniferous period; and the same is true of
all other things, ascending in the scale of refinement and becoming
suitable for the proper development of these creations.
The reasons why such forms should have existed at this period
and not at any other, either before or since, is perfectly obvious and
susceptible of demonstration. First, the physical condition of the
earth, both as respects the water and the atmosphere, admitted of no
higher productions. The extreme density and peculiar composition
of water which was then largely impregnated with various solutions,
could not sustain any higher type of organization.  The atmosphere

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                267
with its enormous density prohibited the formation of light bone, active muscle, and tender nerve, and prevented entirely such chemical
combinations of the solids as were necessary to rendei them light and
active. For this reason their anatomy was heavy and extremely
large. They were sluggish and powerful, and their dispositions wert
ferocious and entirely carnivorous, such being results of the lowest
developments of the principle of Sensation. And the bones of the
higher classes could not contain air instead of marrow, because the
condition of the elements prevented the sublimation of the internal
osseous substances. Although apparent wings were developed, these
were used only as instruments of traversing the watery deep, and
raising themselves a few feet from the surface of the earth; such being the first examples offlying.  Also the respiratory organs of the
whole animal creation were such as only to correspond with an atmosphere very dissimilar to that of the present day.
The lowest and the highest, with their intermediates, when joined
together as the sublime production of one of Nature's days, presents
a distinct mirror of the succeeding creations.  And they present distinct types of the higher classes that were soon to be unfolded in their
stead by virtue of changes in all conditions which were constantly in
progress.
Thus the earth manifests at this time a development of all the
types of the previous periods.  It also unfolds new laws, new elernents, and new principles.  It has the appearance of an entire new
creation.
But Nature has now become modified, and her previous essences
and principles are expended in the yielding forth of the productions
of the present era. The previous equilibrium has now become nearly
destroyed. Energies are exhausted, and new exertions can not be
made.  The whole represents a state of paralysis.  Darkness is beginning gradually to enshroud the aspect of things.  The fertility of
the earth has become partly destroyed, and the forms that reclothed
the bosom of Nature on the morning of the second day, have now
sunk into deep repose.  Thus every morning becomes an evening.
Thus every beauty becomes a type of some ultimate and more beautiful productions.  Thus life, and beauty, and youthfulness, become
age, repose, and death! Thus every substance in being, no matter
how exalted, is of necessity the lowest symbol of some still higher
forms. That which had represented one of the most beautiful pro

cesses in all Nature's elaborations, now yields to a final consummation; and all things bear externally the impress of retrogression, but
internally and invisibly signify the unfolding of interior beauties to
produce a more exalted state of physical and mental organization.
The sublimation of the internal particles of the earth, of plants, of
animals, of water, and of atmosphere, had become so general that an
epoch distinguished by the same manifestations as was the close of
the previous age, must occur. At this moment the whole earth is
clothed in the evening mantle of a long-enduring day. And the fiery
element in the earth's interior became agitated.  This was not effected, as has been supposed, by water, or sulphur, or electricity;
but by the insufficient pressure of the external elements, or the water
and atmosphere. The result was the upheaval of many more portions of the earth. The convulsion was not so general nor so violent
as the former; but the hills that had been formed by the previous
undulations of the great Mass became much elevated, and the strata
broken and contorted in various places. Many beautiful caves and
subterranean passages were formed in the interior of those convoluted
portions. This explosion was rather gentle in comparison to the former catastrophic occurrences, and was felt generally south of the
equator and at the poles.
The earth diminished instantly in bulk, which occurrence was accompanied by the projection of various islands that are mostly manifested in the south seas.  Some of these were previously sea-bottoms
covered with immense productions of animalcules. Such were immense coral reefs, extending from twenty to sixty miles, and being
from three to eight miles in thickness.  These vast accumulations
were formed by animals so minute that two hundred of them could
dwell within a drop of water! Thus the saying of the key is verified: "That the parts compose the Whole; and that the Whole
must have consisted of parts, or else the Whole could not have
existed."
~ 50. All Nature now assumed a different aspect.  Plants and
animals that had previously existed upon the earth, were scarcely
visible: for during the long evening of the previous day, they
gradually diminished and sunk into repose. The only evidence
then remaining of their existence was their fossils, which at the present day are being discovered by geologists.  The earth, water, and
atmosphere, were altogether differently combined and very much re

fined, insomuch that the dense atmosphere that had before enveloped
the earth, now assumed a condition suitable for the admission of more
light from the sun. And the light that shone before, now became
darkness; for the sun emitted much more light: and the air, and
water, and earth, were so changed as to cause all things to assume
an appearance of youthfulness. And not until this period could the
sun have generated so much light and heat among the associated
particles of the atmosphere.
Thus a universal change had taken place throughout the elementary combinations of Nature: and this was the dawn of a new era,
the indication of new forms, new substances, and new organizations,
that were to clothe the bosom of Nature with beauty and magnificence. All laws, conditions, and circumstances, therefore, became active agents in breathing into existence new productions.  And as this
ushering-in of new combinations constitutes the beginning of a new
era, it is impossible not to admire the forcible passage in the primitive history of the earth, which declares, with the exclusion of all
particulars, and with the comprehension of all generals, that "the
evening, and the morning were the third day."
We come now to contemplate the youthful productions of another
morn in the palaontological and geological history of the earth's creation-new  phenomena, which are no less remarkable than the creations already described.
The first geological development that follows the consummation
oPthe new red sandstone, is the chemical oolite beds.  The first of
these are formed of the aggregation of the calcareous substances into
great masses, the whole of wllich constitutes one stratum. And in
it are found the substances of alumina-shale, magnesian limestone,
coral-reefs, and various species of the lower orders of infusoria and
molluscs. In various places these materials are found united much
below the sandstone, or the carboniferous formation, and in other
places they lie directly upon the new red sandstone, as produced by
the chemical combination of the same substances associated in globules
such as characterize the oolite formation.
The previous agitation of the earth, sea, and air, and the restoration of the required equilibrium, constituted the cause which produced
the first strata above the sandstone.  The substances that were more
calcareous than others took the lowest point in these strata; whereas
the highest are composed of the finer materials, the whole resulting

from the circumstances occurring at the close of the last day. By
these and other existing causes, the oolite stratification became
established: and the whole process was strictly ctemnical, and
was accomplished by virtue of conditions that had not before existed.
No stratification has attracted so much attention among geologists
as this.  For it represents a formation as resulting from the decomposition of previously-existing plants, animals, and molluscs, together
with the deposition of solutions of existing substances upon the land
and in the water; and the whole renders this stratification altogether
mysterious and incomprehensible.  It is known that lime in various
proportions enters into this formation; but the cause has not as yet
been discovered, which could possibly unite the substances of the previous formations with the living substances of the earth, and render
the whole an aggregated stratification.  And by passing the substances of the various oolite beds through chemical processes, aluinina and other substances will be discovered; not as naturally inherent ingredients, but as a condensation of the dis&plved particles of
previous formations.  And it has also been a source of extensive
speculation, how innumerable plants and animals, yielded forth previously to this era, could have become entirely annihilated, with the
exception of a few fossil remains which have happily escaped unimpaired, by being shielded fiom the decomposing conditions that followed the close of the former period.  But as it has been proved in
the Key that " forms are constantly changing, and all particles coinposing them finally compose some new form or substance," so ly
this unchanging law, the whole animal creation, at the close of the
third day, entered, by chemical combination, into the formation of
oolite stratification. Productions previously formed contained all the
qualities and elements requisite for the production of new and more
perfect forms; and so the former gross types were exceedingly
changed by this new aggregation.  Therefore, as a result of new energies and elements, new conditions and circumstances, a new creation now followed as an ultimate of the last.
At this time, the sea was abundantly inhabited by fishes, which
ranged from the lowest type to the most gigantic saurian, such as existed during the sandstone system.  And at this time, the dry land
had not as yet yielded any new vegetable formations, or animal organizations. But the atmospheric robe of the earth had become so
far suitable to breathe life into new forms, that Nature must of neces

sity become impregnated, and unfold more perfect forms of vegetable
existence.
The destruction of the living species at the close of each day, is
no more than the deposition of a living germ by whose gestation far
more magnificent productions are brought forth.  Thus every condition is a cause to unfold higher developments-whereas, each day
constitutes a great Cause, and also a great Effect and Use; and these
are united in one. And the whole constitutes a Cause adapted to
the unfolding of a more perfect state of things, by which latter, again,
new uses, causes, and effects, are conceived and generated. And
here Nature manifests one of her most refined creations, it being
far more perfect than any previous productions of internal substances.
The above remarks may afford suggestions by which geologists
may hereafter discover the existing chain of development and the
causes of the new effects which are presented in this period of the
earth's history, and by which they may properly understand why
fossils are discovered in some portions that were formed after the
species to which they belonged were entirely annihilated -and also
how such stratifications occurred.  For in the knowledge of these
things consists the solution of the great mystery of universal death
and universal resurrection, which the whole earth shows to have occurred at different epochs preceding the present time.
~-51. The plants that now became visible were of the classes of
the sigillaria and conifers, and also of the highest class of ferns, and.
of the lowest of Iceland moss; and the vegetable system was united
with one chain of successive ascension from the lowest type of the
sea-plant to the highest and most perfect, consisting of the coniferae,
oak, and birch, such as are now known. During the middle and
toward the close of the sandstone period, the evaporation of the waters produced frequent rains; and these now were still more frequent,
and rendered the earth very fertile.  These assisted the growth of
extensive fields of grass, varying from the lowest to the highest type
which is now exemplified in the rye. But the grass and grain were
very gross and imperfect, insomuch that existing thistles became their
almost immediate associates, more from nature than from form.
Thus was clothed the surface of the earth, especially near the
equator, where the temperature was subject to but little change. And
by this constant and natural process of production, the face of the

272            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONSo
earth became generally fertile of the lower and highei classes of the
vegetable kingdoms.
And the earth also, by its living energies, yielded spontaneousl)
new forms in the animal creation, from the lowest type of the mollusc, to the imperfect forms of the marsupial animals - which latter
were altogether differently constituted and organized fiom any animal
that had existed before that period.  These constituted the lower
class of the mnarzmalia, which class are very dissimilar in their form,
habits, dispositions, and manner of reproduction, from  any of the
oviparous animals.  Thus we have now a new class-a new type,
such as had not been before developed. And this requires a more
minute description, because it is more intimately connected with the
unfolding of higher species, of which it may yet be perceived that
Man stands as a universal representative.
It is impossible to demonstrate from the observations of geologists,
or by the indications of the present series of formations, the distinct
type of every class of terrestrial animals that existed upon the earth's
surface previously to the production of the species of the marsupial
class which has been designated.  For geologists can not determine
upon the period when the mammifers were first developed.  It
is by their nature and constitution that we correctly conceive of a
true type wherein is first displayed the principle of gelatinous uterogestation. The oviparous types, including the bird, fish, and reptile,
in which also many subdivisions of the saurians might properly be
included, were very different as respects their powers and processes
of reproduction, insomuch that their progeny were occasionally rendered dissimilar to themselves, partaking both of their own nature
and of that of the higher saurians, according to the conditions under
which the reproduction was accomplished.
There are now existing upon the earth, from  the fertility of the
calcareous composition of the oolite, three distinct classes of forms
in the vegetable kingdom.  These comprehend the classes of the
previous formation, including the lower order of the fucoides, and
the endogenous and exogenous plants, one of which receives substances from the inward, and the other upon the outward.  And there
are two distinct classes of animals existing: the saurian oviparous and
the marsupial mammiferous —these possessing different habits and
dispositions, and observing very different processes of reproduction.
And among the latter class are existing the rodentia, ruminating, and
digitigrade.  The highest type now existing has the three natures com

bined, though imperfectly.  And these distinctive characteristics represent the different conditions to which each of these was subjected
during the unfolding of the species —which conditions rendered one
type more perfect than the other, the most perfect being exemplified
in the lower mammifers that have existed upon the earth since the
historical period.
Before entering into a minute description of the characteristics of
the vegetable and animal creations, of the means by which this change
in the mode of gestation was accomplished, and to show the intimate
connexion which the latter sustains with the progressive development
of the same species, it is necessary to notice more particularly the
chemical combinations of the oolite stratification.
It is the opinion of several geologists that this formation, particularly the part of it which is termed the " dirt-beds," must have been
a result of the agitation of the seas by which segregation occurred,
and so extensively that the currents of the seas were changed from
their previous to various other directions; and that at the terminations of these currents, the accumulation and condensation of vegetable substances and detritus produced one stratum  or more of coal..
And this opinion has been maintained because some portions of the,
lower oolite beds were discovered beneath a stratum of coal.  Coal,.
however, was not formed (except by incidental circumnstances) afterthe consummation of the general carboniferous era.  And the strata
of oolite that have been discovered under a formation of coal, are the
associated particles of marlstone, iron-stone, and sandstone-shale —
the same being represented in lower strata of the deposite succeeding
the new red sandstone.  In various places this has been termed
the " lias," and "marlstone."  As was before mentioned,. the remains of all the organic beings whose dissolution. occurred from tlec
general change of the earth, water, and atmosphere, entered, by
chemical affinity, into the oolite formation.  Therefore the latter
contains in substance the germ of higher existences; and the deposition of previous plants and animals, whose germinating tendency was
assisted by the congenial existing elements, insured the unfolding of
new forms displaying youth and beauty.
And it is to be remarked that the present era exhibits the condensation of the ultimate substances of a'l the previous ages, which substances, by becoming associated with higher ones, produced thile fertile and productive soil that existed, upon the earth's surface at. this
period.  It is evident, therefore,.that there could not have been pro1S

duced before this period an equally perfect type of fortnation and
development. But the lowest substance typifies the highest; and
both exist equally in the early and present formation of the earth, in
the first and present development of the mineral, in the lowest and
highest of the vegetable, and in the least perfect of the animal creation, and the highest mammifer, such as manifests the perfection of
all previously-existing circumstances.
~ 52. The lower series and degrees of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, such as were unfolded in previous ages, stand in striking
ciorrespondence to those of the oolite era.  And from the most minute sea-plant to the ascending cryptogamia, and firom  this to the
imperfect development of the dicotiledons, there are presented no
greater degrees of distinction than there are from the lower order of
the infusolia to the highest species of the marsupial animals now in-,troduced upon the earth.  And it is known by the indications of the
previous days of creation, that the conditions became generally
changed as each ascending law assumed new modes of manifestation,
by the whole of which new forms were breathed into existence.  In
the general view, the whole is perfectly connected; but in noticing
particularly the incidental changes which took place, the mind loses
sight of that universal order which is otherwise manifest.
The inquiry in reference to the processes by which the change of
form  occurred which established the marsupial mammifers, is very
difficult to answer so that a distinct evidence may be manifest from
facts observed.  And it is to be impressed that the species of this,era present an ascended type as resulting from the chemical compound germ  deposited in the whole oolite formation.  These new
conditions therefore unfolded a new type, and a representation of
bhigller orders. Then the oviparous, the lower viviparous, and the:higher or marnmiferous, present three general processes of uterodevelopment.  The first represents the rudimental process by which
the deposited ultimate of the body unites with particles of like affinity
and assumes the globular form. And by constant activity of the portions surrounding the globule, an incrustation or shell is formed, the
whole constituting an egg.  And this, by processes varying according to the immediately surrounding conditions, unfolds its rudimental
properties, and displays the type and character of its progenitor.
The ascension of this process presents a different mode of the combination of elements, developing new organs, and unfolding a higher





## p. 275 (#303) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 275
order of interior qualities.  And this ascension establishes the ovary
globules-which are represented in the lower classes of the viviparous animals and visibly developed in the higher.  Therefore the
order immediately above the first viviparous are the marsupialswhose habits, nature, and dispositions, present an entire change: and
their organization presents a further unfolding of the undeveloped
compounds contained in all the lower types in existence.
Geologists have discovered in the first and second divisions of this
formation some distinct species of this noammifer, but have not discovered any connecting links between these species.  The species
that have been discovered bear a relation to the lower marsupial animals of the present day.  But their character was very different, and
their organization much more gross; but the conditions which surrounded them  were more favorable to the unfolding of the higher
orders, than those of any previous age.  But the connexion existing
between each class can not be seen until the discoveries vwhich will
be made in other strata are such as to fully determine the whole class
of animals pervading the lower secondary formation.
The conditions of which I speak as rendering the animal kingdomn
at this time so far superior to its condition in previous ages, can be
generally understood by considering the modifications that occurred
in the elements at the close of each epoch of development.  The
principles that were required for a change in the process of reproduction, were involved in the lower classes, but only unfolded in
the higher.  Therefore the marsupial animals only possessed the
three principles, Motion, Life, and Sensation, in a more perfect state
than any in whlich they had before existed.  And the instrument
upon which these were more fully active must have been correspon(ldingly perfected.  The whole corresponds to the dicolitedonous tornns
and functions of the vegetable kingdom, the animal possessing, as it
(lid, the serous and mucous surfaces.  These surfaces, though very
imperfect in generating the living, active energies of the body, did
perform the office in the lower and higher species requisite for the
development of the seminal secretions induced by the sensation of
coition. As these surfaces, like the heart and lungs, perform the
systolic and diastolic motions, they likewise generate, when in equal
activity, the chemically-combining sensation whereby the whole process of utero-gestation becomes permanently established.  And at
each stage of the unfolding of qualities, new adaptations were requisite, so that the species might live after being brought forth.

276            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
The marsupial animals display principles involved in the positive
and negative surfaces in a manner more perfect than any other animal has as yet done. For this reason they could not continue the
oviparous process of reproduction: and being entirely viviparous and
mammiferous, they displayed the law of progressive development.
It is not necessary to give a minute description of the process by
which the animal creation assumed the character of the marsupial;
for this will be more extensively revealed hereafter, when it becomec
necessary to speak more immediately in reference to the knowledge
and speculations of physiologists upon the subject under consideration.  For the principles involved in, and the conditions required
for, the process of transmutation, are not altogether understood. For
the animals of every class are apparently distinct and disconnected
from others, and every class sustains its own types; and none are
known to man to change their character or species in any particular.
Hence the conclusion has been adopted that each class is the result
of an immediate creative power, and that all types of each specific
creation are only patterns of that which succeeds.  No discovery has
yet been made which seems to indicate distinctly the process of
transmutation.  Transmutation, however, is a constant manifestation
in Nature; and nothing exists but what involves the principle of
ascension and progression.
The elements which surround the earth owe their existence to an
aboriginal condition of the whole Mass.  The stability of the Mass
now becomes dependent upon the stability of those elements.  The
plants require for their production a proper condition of the earth,
and of the existing elements; and without these they could not exist.  The animals require the plants, and the highest of the latter require the lower species.  So of all the gigantic carnivorous saurians ~
they sustain the same relation to the lower species of the same class,
and thus all those that were first and herbiverous become adapted to
the requirements of the higher orders.
Therefore each kingdom presents a series of corresponding steps
and degrees of development.  And so the marsupialia, which the
oolite period presents, constitute also an ascending step or degree
above, though connected with, all previous organizations.  There is
no violation of law or order in this higher development; but there is
an apparent disconnexion between the first forms developed on the
earth, and the marsupials, when the two are compared with each
other. And in making this comparison we lose sight of the slow

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  277
processes of change which all forms passed through, from the lowest
ascending to the highest type in the animal kingdom.
A strict attention to the general Cause and general Effect, would:elieve the mind of this apparent anomaly, and explain these wonderful steps in Nature's unfoldings.  The organization of each anitnal requires the composition of the earth and other existing elements
to be in accordance with the conditions which, from its peculiar
nature, it must require.  And as the particles of the atmosphere,
plants, and animals, and all particles pervading Nature, assume higher
forms than the angular, the form of the animal will correspond in
perfection to the forms of such existing particles.  Therefore, as will
soon be shown, the whole class of animals which the secondary formation presents, ascends to the first type wherein we may recognise
the undeveloped principles composing the physical and mental constitution of mankind.  But as the gradual process of the assumption
of successive and corresponding forms should be described, I am not
impressed to speak at present any more concerning the gestating
principles involved in the marsupial animals.
5~ 3. I am impressed that the orders, series, and degrees, of animals that existed during the oolite, cretaceous, and tertiary eras, are
very different from, and of a higher nature than, those designated by
geologists.  The remains of the plesiosaurus, igruana, and sauridon,
leave been found among the upper strata of the oolite, and the commencement of the cretaceous period.  These in reality were perpetuations of the reptiles that existed before the consummation of the
new red-sandstone system.  Moreover, the general elements were
not so favorable in many portions of the earth for the production of
the marsupial animals, while in other portions these animals existed
before the commencement of the oolite period; and their fossils may
there be discovered.  For the general law of reproduction had become greatly changed, the result of which was the declension of some
of these species, and the perpetuation of the higher orders.  Geologists have distinguished the main classes, but not all of their varieties
and modifications.  For the saurocephalus is among the lower orders
of the species that existed during this period.  This is remarkable as
being the first animal that possessed the proper division of the larger
and smaller brains, whereby systolic and diastolic action was established as governing the whole vital motions of the body.
Of a connecting link and species of this, the steptospondylis is an

example -this having the nature and habits both of the carnivorous
and herbivorous, representing slightly those of the water-bird.  This
animal has been discovered in the strata of the miocene, and has
been supposed to be a sauridon, related to the monitor and iguana.
A higher order of the megalosaurus also exists and forms a connecting link between the lower order and the higher classes of animals:
and from this proceeds many species of the class mammalia.
The whole animal kingdom, then, at this period, is divided into
three degrees: the saurian, the tortoise, and the mammalia-the latter comprising the rodentia, the ruminantia, and the digitigrade.  The
highest of these unfolds new principles and new forces, the whole of
which appears to indicate an ascension of Motion, Life, and Sensation.  Thus the highly carnivorous nature existed as a pre-requisite
to the unfolding of the higher class.  And here are developed the
two surfaces distinctly, and consequently the contracting and expand
ing forces.  And the attribute of these is sensation and inclinations,
and the passions which result from these are the indications by which
the characters and dispositions of animals are known.  In the highel
class of this period, therefore, we may consider that Sensation has
become an established law, this not being so perfectly unfolded in
the constitution of the lower animals, such as existed before this
period.  For it is by the perfection of this principle, for which the
two surfaces and two forces are required, that the first, acting, living
energies, were produced, by which the marsupial species, and the
process of utero-gestation, became established.
The species of plants were not very numerous, these being principally of the same degree and type as those existing in the lower
formation: and of these the ferns and conifers were the most abundant. No law is more certain than that of the constant progression
and ascension of all rudimental substances; and no period in the
geological history of the earth manifests this principle more thoroughly
than this.  For near the close of the secondary period, an entire
change appears evident in all the degrees, classes, and developments,
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.  Geologists have not fuilly
discovered this: for the tertiary period appears to them as a very
slight ascension from that of the oolite and cretaceous.  But they
will discover this great division, and especially the apparent new creation, by investigating properly the chemical combinations of all
higher earthy compounds formed just before the commencement of
the tertiary period.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 279
It has been supposed also that the cretaceous formation was the
result of the solutions and detritus contained in the sea, and of the
motions of the latter whereby. deposition occurred.  It is evident
that this formation could not have thus been accomplished; for it is
well ascertained that all the solutions from which it is supposed to
have been formed existed many ages previous to this era. And as
chalk is known to be the carbonate of lime crystallized and sublimated, intermixed with various silicious substances existing in the
coatings of the molluscs and in estuaries —if this stratification was
formed by these existing solutions, wvhy was not the same before produced?  For the same materials existed during all of the prior formations.  From  these considerations it is plain that the formation
of this and the upper and kindred strata must have resulted fiom
some other cause.
Many portions do manifest tile drifting of the detritus existing in
the seas.  Still these are the results of local causes, similar to those
by which corresponding deposites occurred in the lower strata.
The substance directly over the oolite is a kind of sand and clay
shale.  Above this is a bluish and clayey stratum.  These represent
the ultimate substances of the strata beneath them.  The substance
of lime transformed into corals by the infusoria, and re-decomposed,
formed, by condensation, the beds of chalk.  In these deposites, and
above them, is frequently found the silicious flintstone.  This is a
substance composed of the ultimate particles of silica or quartz.
These substances have not been found below this formation, although
they are existing in the lower strata of the oolite, where the subdividing strata are wanting.  And this does not derange the order of
geological development; for it corresponds to all the discoveries of
fossils in each department of the animal kingdom.  These irregularities in each formation of the earth, plants, and animals, are determined by the peculiar circumstances attending their respective developments.
The weight of the water and atmosphere determines in part the
strength and character of the two living kingdoms.  Therefore the
gigantic saurian tribes, that inhabited the earth in previous ages, corresponded to the enormous density of the existing fluid and gaseous
elements; for these were very different in quality and composition
from what they have subsequently been.  And the character of the
organic productions of each period was in accordance with the laws
and forces that were in action at the tirne of their-development.  And

280            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
corresponding to the recompositions of the watery and atmospheric
elements, the kingdoms of the living species became also changed;
and the modification of orders of plants or animals, which required
ages to be accomplished, is, in some instances, such as to present a
very different species from the first forms of the same class: and
when the great dissimilarity is observed, the mind loses the connexion
between the lowest and the hi-ghest. -But this would not be the case
if the mind could comprehend the eternal truth that all higher things
are contained in tlbe lowest, undeveloped.  And the lowest being the
germ, all others will, if subjected to proper conditions, ascend through
all the progressive forms until it becomes a perfected compound of the
whole previously-existing mass.  And the cretaceous formation exhlibits an evident ascension of particles which previously existed in a
grosser form.
~ 54. As rivers, seas, and oceans, such as now exist, together with
various promninences upon the land, were, as was before described,
results of the last universal volcanic disturbance —so by the influence of this disturbance, exceeding winds and immense waves were
also created, accompanied by very heavy rains.  These were caused
by the various portions of the atmosphere being suddenly displaced
by the-ascension of vapor into the atmosphere, this vapor filling a space
corresponding to its volume.  By these means some portions of the
atmosphere became dense and others rare; and the result of this was
winds to restore the equilibrium.  And these were very strong and
enduring.
The bodies of water that were thrown into agitation by these forces
produced similar commotions in the uncondensed beds of the sea,
acting also upon the low surfaces of the land which became generally overflown.
At this period, tile sea abounded with innumerable infusoria. And
by the activity of the polyparia, and also by the aggregation of the
substances transformed by other classes of animalcules, immense
coral-reefs were formed.  These were destroyed and reduced to an
entire solution by the constant agitation.  And there was a recession
from the mass, of all uncongenial particles that were floating in solution throughout the watery waste.  The action of one was a cause
of similar action in the other.  And thus by a constant friction and
agitation, a substance was formed which, when thus deposited and
condensed, produced, as was described, the upper cretaceous strata,

I have been particular in this description, because it represents the
general process by which all subsequent formations occurred: and
also because this formation indicates a decided adaptation to the development of new forms, approaching more nearly that of the human
organization.  And this will te discovered by analyzing the various
portions of these strata, in which will be discovered iron-stone, tin,
copper (the iron being above them all) —and the same composition
that is contained in the solids and osseous substances of the human
system.  And it will be discovered that the chalk is precisely the
substance which enters into the, formation of all the bones, both of
the bird and saurian species of that era.  Now there exists a more
perfect form of the same substance, characterized by a more perfect
form of particles.
It is a truth constantly presented in all analytical investigations,
that the compound constituting the higher form is a unity of the lower
and rudimental substances, and that the inherent'properties of these
govern the higher substances as to their properties and composition.
These rudimental formations or stratifications may be properly termed
beginnings, or principles, in which are conceived, and out of which
flow, the higher creations.  And by letting this fact become a standard governing all our investigations of the sciences, the mind would
naturally become enlarged: for it is by properly conceiving of causes,
of which forms are the effects, that our knowledge of Nature and her
productions becomes perfected.
i am distinctly impressed that the parts of the present cretaceous
formation that have not been investigated will indicate different species of animals, the types of which are still existing.  This period
bears a closer relation to the feline tribe, and also is more nearly
allied to man than has been supposed by geologists.
The chalk is a substance but little supposed to be existing in almost every form  upon the earth in subsequent periods.  And the
marsupial mammifers, of which the pleilocotlierium and phascolotherium are examples, have been discovered in some parts of the
upper cretaceous strata.  But these do not represent the character
of the animal kingdom during this period.
Concerning the general condition of the earth at the close of the
present period it is not necessary to speak, inasmuch as the commencement of the tertiary formation almost imperceptibly follows the
chalk-beds.  This in some portions is composed of disintegrated
limestone and marine lime-solutions, interspersed with decomposed

marly substances.  The whole process required many ages for its
completion; for the disintegrating power was not so general nor active until a new catastrophe occurred, of which more will hereafter
be said.
It is apparent, fiom the indications o'f the strata, that many species
which had before inhabited the sea and land, now became extinct.
These it is known gave place to others, corresponding to the new
formation of the earth and elements.
What is most remarkable as connected with this period is the partial change of temperature, the falling of snow, the formation of large
mountains of ice, and generally a light and more congenial atmosphere as encompassing the earth.  And the lines of variation and
no variation, which govern our arctic and torrid temperatures (about
which more will be said), constantly changed, and these changes
produced corresponding changes in the atmosphere, and consequently
the temperature, which resulted in the frequent melting of these
mountains of ice.  And this melting was always followed by an enlargement of the body of the water upon the face of the earth.
Not until this period did the seasons become properly established.
And these were very irregular according to the condition of the elements on which their distinctions were dependent.  It is, then, natural to conceive that the atmosphere yielded more light, more warmth,
and consequently more fertility, in the equatorial portions of the
earth, than it had in any preceding age.
The change which occurred was general.  Its effect upon the atmnosphere was such as to adapt it to the admission of more heat and
light, from which fact more activity was generated.  And from this
it is evident that Nature had undergone, during the lapse of innumerable ages, another day of formation; and the period had arrived concerning which it is said, " The greater light ruled the day, and the
lesser the night."  It was by this fact that the seasons were properly
established. And thus all the lights that were existing in the heavens, consisting of the innumerable orbs of the stellar system, gave
light upon the earth, inasmuch as each particle of light that emanated
from these celestial bodies communicated motion to every other particle between it and the earth; and thus the earth and its atmnospheric
mantle were rendered luminous and congenial.
The mind will now receive the conviction that this change in Nature and her elements must have consisted in the adaptations of conditions and principles to the ushering-in of a new era, characterized

by developments far more beautiful and perfect than any which had
preceded.  Therefore the expression in a previous historical account
given of this consummation is substantially verified, that " the evening
and tl/e #iorning were the fourth day."
~ 55. It is now presented to the understanding that the commencement of the tertiary period, with its productions, is the morn of a new
day of the earth's creations.  It is not necessary to describe minutely the process by which the tertiary formation was produced; for it
has been discovered that it consists of deposites of lime, shale, clayey
lime, marl, and sand, with the solutions then existing in the sea.
The constant aggregation of these various substances produced the
lower and intermediate strata contained in the eocene and miocene
deposites; after which, by similar means, the pliocene with its upper
division was formed.
This classification has not been made in reference to the different
earthy strata of the tertiary, but rather in reference to the vegetable
and animal remains which they contain.  Therefore I proceed directly to a consideration of the physical phenomena presented before
and during this period, and also to describe the ascension and development of the kingdoms.
The historical period manifested at its commencement, more than
it has at any subsequent time, marks of the previous and long-continued flowings of bodies of water in an oblique direction from the
northwest to the southeast.  These are also constantly represented,
by the wearings on the rocks, to have taken other directions during
the great agitations which occurred during the fifth day of creation.
The enormous mountains of ice that were formed by the change of
seasons and of the general temperature of the climate, became, as was
before said, frequently reduced to their fluid state.  And at every
season in which this phenomenon occurred, great tides were also
produced, whereby the ice, and various substances that were imbedded in it, were carried to various parts of the earth.  During this
process, extensive disintegration occurred, and great wearings upon
the mountains and prominences over which the great body of water
passed.
It must be understood that the oceans had not exactly the same
positions, nor were they so much contracted, as they now are. And
it must have been this agitation, created by the powerful winds and
consequent storms that occurred during this and preceding periods

that produced the incisions which are visible on the rocks and mount,
ains and other portions that now are dry land, but which then were
partially or wholly covered by the waters.
During the seasons when the water was congealed to ice,'the great
body of that element was not so much excited.  But when the change
tomin a cold to a warm temperature occurred, heavy winds were as a
consequence produced, and these caused the great agitation.  Other
incidental causes were constantly producing their effects, which will
be more plainly understood when I speak of the restoration of the
equilibrium  of the water and atmosphere at the close of the present era.
Some portions of the dry land became now very fertile, and yielded forth an abundance of vegetation.  All the lower species, from the
sea-weed to the cryptogamia, and also the higher and dicotiledonous
orders, were now produced. All the classes of the palm and coniferae, from the lower up to the intermediate and higher, that existed
during this period, are exemplified in the general vegetation of the
present day-with the exception of their form and size, they being
much larger-not so high, yet more bulky, than any now upon the
fertile portions of the earth.  A species of tree, like that known as
the rock-oak, was most extensively developed in the forests of the
tertiary period-possessing such qualities that either decomposition
or petrifaction generally followed their decline. For we have no indications of the existence of trees of this class except the petrified
portions that still remain in the upper strata of the pliocene.
The lower vegetable formations of this period are now exemplified
in the grains below the rye and wheat, and in various common vegetables, though no species belonging to the historical formation then
existed with the exception of a small plant resembling the potato.
And the higher forest vegetation, such as the oak, the birch, and the
maple, are all exemplified in the tertiary period.  The whole vegetation of this era, as in the.preceding ones, is gross and bulky in cornparison to the orders and species of the vegetable kingdom of the historical period.
The animal kingdom presents throughout a correspondence with
the vegetable.  The animals, as to their main features and characteristics, were strong, and gross and very imperfect in form, habit,
and disposition. There was a species of the megalosaurus and ple.
siosaurus still existing.  And these ascend from the saurian species
in form, nature, and disposition, up to the semi-elephant or masto

don, including the intermediate species, such as the hippopotamus'
rhinoceros, unicorn, walrus, and the several species of the huge sloth.
It has. been supposed by geologists that this period presents absolutely the first distinction between the lower orders and the ruminantia and quadrupeds.  These last classes, together with the edentata,
form the distinctive features of the animal kingdom  at this period,
each of which presents the higher order of utero-development.  In
this period the lower marsupials insensibly become almost entirely
extinct; and the whole animal productions of the present era represent entirely a new creation.
It must be borne in mind that every day of creation presents a new
unfolding of rudimental forms and substances composing in their
lower states the lower orders of animals and plants.  Therefore
the creations of each succeeding day correspond to the creations of
the previous ones, and to the orders of other forms, but present a
new development, consisting of higher species, according as conditions were rendered favorable by the progressive unfolding of laws
and elements.  Therefore in this day the quadrumana stands as the
highest type and the most perfect form of the whole creation.  And
it is still more remarkable that the highest of this order is very slightly
represented by the present monkey.
Geologists have no means to arrive at an absolute knowledge of
the form, order, and character, of this class.  For it was many thousand years before the primitive history of man was written that this
class represented the highest order of Nature's productions; and they
subsequently passed into new forms, the old type becoming entirely
extinct.
~ 56. The physical condition of the earth, and the order and degree of its animal developments during the tertiary formation, are
distinguished by more remarkable manifestations than the same things
are at any other period.  The change of climate and the establishment of seasons have changed generally the productions and aspect
of the whole earth.
And it is a fact altogether overlooked in the researches of meteorologists, that the condition of the higher degrees of the imponderable
elements determines entirely the temperature of the atmosphere, from
its minimum to its maximum degree of heat or cold.  For it must be
utderstood as an established axiom, that cold is the absence of heat,
and that heat is the ultimate condition of its negative or unascended

286            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
temperature.  To solve the phenomenon of the variations of the
temperature, terms are requisite that are not in reality expressive of
the true conditions or meaning. For indeed no forms of expression
nor efforts of language have been suitable to convey a scientific
knowledge of the real controlling principles of Nature, developing
constantly the lower and higher, or cause and effect.
At this stage of the earth's geological progress, the cold in arctic
regions was greater than it had been at any previous time.  For near
the close of the new red sandstone, and during all the subsequent
ages to the consummation of the tertiary, heavy frosts and snows,
and enormous mountains of ice, prevailed extensively throughout the
polar regions. And these frequently became suddenly melted into
water, which flowed to warmer climates.  The temperature of the
seasons was also varied by exceeding storms of wind and rain, fiequently caused by the disturbance of the equilibrium of the atmosphere.  For let it be properly impressed that the heat attracted tile
particles of water which constantly ascended and became atmosphere
of a dense character; and when these particles were condensed they
formed rain, which again descended.  Clouds are the result of the
consociation of the particles of atmosphere of equal density; and
these becoming entirely too dense to continue in the atmosphere, descend to associate with their former element.  Such is the cause of
the common phenomenon of rain; and this never would occur if
the temperature were always equal, and the equilibrium  of the air
remained at all times undisturbed.
Such, therefore, was the condition of the elements during the period under consideration; and the consequence was the fiequent and
almost entire submersion of the whole face of Nature.  These occurrences are termed by geologists " inundations"-and the evidences
of such are received from the manifestations of the diluvial deposites.
It is necessary to remark, that the opinion derived from the visible
effects of these frequent storms as manifested in these formations is
not altogether true so far as it respects the period when these inundations occurred.  For on the fourth day of creation the seasons
were established by a proper development of all the conditions requisite for the same, this constituting a more definite and formal development of Nature than could have occurred at any previous period.
And inasmuch as this change became universal, and the temperature
of the seasons was more intense than it has been at any other period,





## p. 287 (#315) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                287
before or since, the storms and inundations above described followed
as a consequence.
Another evidence of the extreme cold toward the poles, and intense heat toward the equator (the whole being produced by the revolutions of the lines of no variation, and the radiation from the poles
of the earth), consists in the abundant remains of calcareous and minute infusory shells which in many places pervade the southern seas
and beaches.  And the chalk-beds are greater as they approach the
torrid regions, being in some places nearly allied to the strata succeeding those of the carboniferous era. And approaching the north,
including the upper part of both continents, the marl, shale, andg
limestone, are very much more conspicuous, both in the cretaceons
and tertiary, than is the chalk or its other kindred substances.
In the portions of the earth that have been searched, it is found
that the calcareous fossils prevail more in and toward the tropical
than in the more northern portions of the earth.  And it has been
discovered (or rather inferred) that the frosts which occurred during
the sandstone period took place during the entire absence of the birds
that inhabited parts of the western continent.  Their tracks are discovered on divisions of the strata where no frost-marks are visible;
which implies that they migrated at the change of the seasons.  And
their fossils have not been found where their tracks have been discovered.
From that period to the present, the seasons have gradually become established; and an extreme difference is now presented between their present and previous character.
And as has been before remarked, meteorologists have failed to
determine the cause of the frequent variations of the seasons from
the commencement of these inundations to the introduction of the
historical period. In speaking of this cause, it is not the intention
to introduce definite calculations, and thus relieve inquirers from the
efforts of mind which would otherwise be necessary.  But it is necessary to intimate the foundation upon which these manifestations
are based, and in a gencral way to explain them; and the minutice
may be traced by existing indications.
~ 57. The dissimilarity of the temperature of the poles at different
times is owing to the varying conditions of an existing element in its
lower and higher degrees of development, and which, though it is
not generated by foreign bodies, is assisted by them to sustain a

connexion with the whole envelope of the earth, firon the lower to
the higher strata of the atmosphere.  The north has been considered
as the location of the magnetic pole, evolving incessantly attractive,
electric fluid, which determines the direction of the magnetic needle.
In the torrid portions of the earth, the particles thrown from the sun
(which, when decomposed, produce light) act upon the water and
atmosphere, which action results in a constant sublimation and development of heat, or the magnetic medium.  It is here termed magnetic for distinction; but properly it is the unfolded heat contained
in the previously-cold medium. The imperceptible rushing of this
current toward the north determines the direction of the magnetic
needle.
And it will be discovered that there are three distinct currents,
corresponding to the rays proceeding from the sun.  The first of
these rays is light without heat: this produces color.  The second is
light without color or heat: this produces chemical action; and in it
the white mnuriate of silver will be turned instantly black.  And all
kindred bodies, undergoing like chemical action, are rendered susceptible of the same by this particular ray of light.  The third ray
neither produces color nor chemical action, but produces warmth by
causing friction betweeni all particles on which it acts.  And this ray
of light acts upon all kindred particles, whereby the whole are transmitted to the particles composing the envelope of the earth, and there
are suitably digested for the nourishment of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms.
The first of these rays is the cause of all color.  The second is
the ray that has been lately supposed to be magnetized.  It produces
the chemical action whereby color and other properties become durable.  And the third comprehends these both-and is the active,
communicative substance, that generates heat by friction upon the
particles of the atmosphere.  And by the atomic modification whiclh
it undergoes in passing through its various motions, it is rendered
suitable to reflect forms upon the retina, and thus to transmit the
knowledge of foreign objects to the brain of every animal in being.
Were not the particles of light thus modified in the great atomic
envelope of the earth, color could not exist.  For color is the reflection of light; and without light, how could we know of color?
And without minute, imperceptible chemical action, how could the
exhalation of the vegetable kingdom become suitable for the inspiration of the animal kingdom?  And without the form of light which

conveys the images of foreign objects, the eye would be a useless
organ.
There hre likewise three distinct fluids crossing the earth from the
south to the north, and from the north to the south, by a mutual exchange of elements from  the poles.  There is also an intersecting
fluid that crosses each of the others; and this has been termed the
"diamagnetic" fluid.  The former fluids are in relations of equality
to each other.  Their termination at the north is the nucleus of the
magnetic pole.  The direction of these fluids establishes the lines of
no variation.  The motion of their attending fluids determines the
lines of variation.  These lines revolve from east to west half way
round the earth while the sun is passing through one of the signs of
the zodiac.*  And wlherever is the meridian of these lines, there is
the greatest degree of cold.  And as the lines approximate to any
particular longitude, so the climnate of that portion of the earth becomes gradually changed; and in this way some portions formerly
characterized by blooming fertility and a congenial atmosphere have
been changed to barrenness, and are now concealed from the light.
of the sun by a mantle of heavy snow and mountains of ice.
In proportion to the prevalence of the substances whose motion,
constitutes these lines, is the temperature rendered cold.  And so;,
every portion of the earth that is subjected to extreme and severe
winters is affected by these lines; and places where winters are most
severe are directly under their influence.  And it is by the constant
evolving of the cold at the north that the heat toward the equator is
rendered more intense; and thus are established two counterbalancing
conditions, or a positive and negative-or the lower or first circulating electric substances, and the higher or magnetic medium..
The severe storms which the tertiary period indicates,.and theflowing of great bodies of water and ice containing other substances.
were the results of the established seasons known as winter and sunimner, and also of the variations of temperature as owing to the revolutions of these lines of no variation.  A series of winters rendered.
extremely severe by the presence of these lines, formed these large,
mountains of ice in the polar regions: and the transition of temperature caused, as before stated, the immense and terrific storms, producing great bodies of water, which carried with them the enormous
icebergs that crossed the surface of the whole earth in the directions:
* That is, by the apparent motion called the prcecessionof the equznoxes..

before described.* The diluvial strata were formed by the deposition of the detritus and various dissolved substances carried by these
great currents. By the deposition of' the finer materials, many portions were also formed that are termed alluvial, especially along the
marine coasts.
These almost universal submersions were followed by a great diminution of the whole body of water which was perceptible during every rigid season.   And during the process of many ages, within
which time these occurrences were frequent, the water and atmosphere began to lose their required density, and this must result in
such a catastrophe as those previously caused by like conditions.
Before the commencement of the last, or historical formation, almost
all the land plants and animals were entirely destroyed: and this destruction occurred from the general submersion of the whole face of
Nature in the watery element.  Many caves were formed previously
to this period; and in them are still found the remains of several
extinct species of animals.
From the great modifications which every department of Nature has
undergone, the conditions required for the unfolding of the subsequent
productions must soon occur. And this will establish a geological and
elemental condition of the earth that may be termed "very good" for
the requirements of the subsequent kingdoms.  And this is to be the
great. transition of the earth from a state of comparative barrenness
and inactivity to a substantial and long-enduring condition adapted
to the existence of new forms with more perfect and exalted com-,pounds. And the geological formations of the earth are now nearly
at an end-with the exception of artificial formations that are still in
progress. And the new energies which are soon to be unfolded will
establish species upon the face of the earth whose types are in exist-,ence at the present day. And then there will be a general activity;and fecundity of the inhabitants of the sea, and of the creeping things,of the earth, these being properly situated to bring forth species after
their kind, and to multiply exceedingly.
And the coldness of the earth, water, and atmosphere, at this period, rendered them more suitable to the development of the lower
orders of creation than they have been at any other period.  Therefore tile fruitfulness indicated by the command to these creeping
-things to bring forth plentifully their like, was in reality a necessary

accompaniment of the then-existing conditions.  And tile conditions
of the earth and of the animal kingdom are not to be compared with
the conditions existing in any other era.
Therefore the original history of the steps and degrees of creation
is incontestably verified: and it would be unjust to use any other form of
expression than that " tlhe evcning and the morning were the fifth day."
~ 58. We have now ascended to a period in the creation of the
earth and kingdoms that is more intimately connected with the scientifics of the world, and which abounds with more distinct representations of all things now existing, than was either of the previous periods.  No history is extant of the commencement of the present
period of time: and all the knowledge that is existing in reference to
the original species is the result of inferences drawn from the present
condition of creation.
Concerning the various degrees of perfection in the developinents
of the previous days, general remarks have been offered; but a description of the specific changes of Nature and her productions, fiom
the first conditions to the present, would have been impossible. And
all the knowledge existing in reference to the laws of Nature is derived from their general and universal effects, and not fiom detailed
manifestations.  And by comprehending general principles, assisted
by an enlarged view of their correspondences, Nature and her laws
will appear as one vast chemical laboratory, in which the lowest constituents of the whole composition are constantly being developed
and purified.  And the whole is a compound of polygastric globules,
whose power of chemical action and principles of progression unfold
all the forms that are developed froin the great Mass —which again
produce new substances and new modes of composition, each being,
unlike the first.  And every internal quality which is sequestered in
present forms is becoming unfolded, and will ultimately progress to
the highest possible form and condition of being.
The first types that are presented upon the face of the earth at the
comlmencement of the sixth day are of an inferior organization, yet
the superiors of all previous forms.  These contain all the qualities
and principles of the previous creations, are representatives of the
highest forms of the animal kingdom, and are a significant type of the
organization of mankind.  But they are as much below man in his
present perfected state as they are above the whole creations and
productions of the previous ages.

292            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Comparative anatomy has been very useful in satisfying the scientific world that there is a relation existing between all forms in being;
but it has almost established in some minds the conclusion that every
form and species in either kingdom has a specific origin and an exclusive existence, so much so that it does not represent a higher degree of lower forms, nor run into any of the more perfect degrees
of organization. Anatomy is eminently useful as a basis of induction; but anatomists have considered the invariableness manifested in
every anatomical form in being as substantial evidence that they are
the specific productions of some power above and independent of
that which Nature possesses, and therefore they have disputed the
opinion that specific forms have been at any previous time the constituent particles of lower forms in creation.
But it is evident that an organic structure, of any type or species,
must have been previously in a different state of composition. Therefore the particles composing the anatomical structure of the vegetable
and animal kingdoms must have been derived firom the lower orders
of formation, and must have ascended to enter into the organizations
in which they are now imbodied.  It is therefore a congregation of
atoms of suitable nature and quality that produces all which the anatomy of the animal kingdom represents. For a superstructure could
not exist before the materials of its composition.  The whole of Nature's manifestations are therefore a positive result of the inherent
principles contained in the whole composition.  Thus anatomy is a
monumental demonstration of the ultimate perfection of lower particles. And the structure of any organization sustains an inseparable
connexion with the first indication of a like arrangement of particles,
and with the highest organization in existence.
Tile subject of the present inquiry comprehends grounds extending far beyond the knowledge of the world respecting the vegetable,
and animal kingdoms; and hence the present descriptions will be
given in a more detailed manner. Still it is impossible, from a comparison with anything now known, to convey a correct knowledge
concerning the original forms and the highest form existing at the
commencement of the sixth day.  But we are einerging, from the
previous degrees and conditions into a state where exists more light
and more facilities for research and investigation.  And this state
also presents one of the unfolding beauties in the magnificent temple
of Nature.
The reflections prompted by an enlarged understanding of Nature

and her laws can not be too deep, or be extended too far back into
the period of animated existence, to be the means of useful instruction. All the forms, elements, and compositions, abounding upon
the face of the earth at this period, can be made useful in unfolding
an understanding of the present developments.  But these can be
of use in this way only as we conceive of the law of correspond~ence.
By a rule in mathematics, an understanding of certain parts of any
form gives, by induction, an absolute knowledge of the other parts;
and from a knowledge of the base and bearings of two angles of a
triangle, the distance of the apex may be positively determined.
And so by proving absolutely that Nature in any of her departments
contains certain laws, principles, and compositions, we may arrive at
an absolute knowledge of Nature's previous conditions, and her future
and transcending developments.
It is to be remarked (by way of introduction to the considerations
respecting the sixth period of creation) that the descriptions that were
formerly given have been addressed, and those which are to come
will be addressed, particularly to the power of the minds of the world
to conceive of truths by analogy or correspondence.  And if such a
power is not yet unfolded in some minds, it is possible that they will
not understand the truths thus presented; and this they can not do
until they assume a degree of perfection suitable to associate with
such interior and universal truths.  It is to be further remarked that
it is only by the science of mathematical correspondence that a knowledge can be had of anything in Nature, of any of her motives and
living energies or their effects, or of the progressive tendency of all
particles in being to higher substances, higher qualities, and more
perfect interiors.  And the knowledge obtained by any other process
does not extend beyond the conviction of external fJrm.  And t/is
conviction is not absolutely satisfactory to an inductive and comprehensive mind; for such a mind must first know by what power and
principle it is enabled to associate with external forms.  And the
mind which comprehends no more than that which is visible, understands but very little of Nature, or the principles of being.  But in an
expansive mind, the question arises, " What is the cause of the existence of any external fomrn?"  And by properly conceiving of the
cause, such a mind is drawn by an interior affection to the Cause of
all causes, by analyzing and comprehending the general causes and
effects, both visible and invisible, and then observing the perfect

294            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
adaptation and arrangement of all these to the Whole, and the Whole
to its ultimate use.
There is a grandeur in the visible forms of Nature which can only
be seen by a mind first duly impressed with their interior qualities.
~ 59. The first day of creation unfolded one of the laws or attributes connected with the great Whole; and that is Power: and this
power was manifested in ceaseless Motion.  The developments of
the second day unfolded the attribute of Wisdom.  And Goodness
was manifested in the arrangement and adaptation of all things on the
third day.  The peculiar conditions and circumstances existing on
the fourth day, and their results, which were " very good," manifested Wisdom, and also developed Jqstice and Reciprocation. The
fifth day unfolded a new order of beings -such as possessed powers
and faculties and a degree of sensibility not before existing; and
therefore they were capable of fecling the difference between the
lower and the higher forms.-Hence they could feel a forbearance.
For from the knowledge of their own power and pre-eminence, a regard is always manifested by the more perfect forms for the lower
orders.  Thus a spirit of mercy and forbearance was established
among the animated tribes.  The beauties which were unfolded on
the sixth day, connected as they are with all previous forms, and
being a development of their interior qualities, correspond to the ultirnate ascension of all forms, particles, and principles, and the unfolding of all the attributes originally involved in the first Type, or the
Germ of all subsequent developments.
And while the last attribute unfolded corresponds to all others, its
grandeur rises above the highest conceptions of the minds of the
world.  And notwithstanding the arduous efforts that have been
made to conceal this unfolding principle, it is gradually becoming more
and more revealed as the interior qualities of mankind are capable
of receiving it.  This principle comprehends all below its degree of
refinement, and contains qualities that will unfold eternally beyond.
It is the medium of association between all spiritually-expanded
minds.  It encompasses and pervades all Nature-the whole world
- the Universe.  It is the essential germ of more perfect beautiesthe highest attribute of the present sphere.  It is that which is to be
admired and adored above every other thing.  It should illuminate
the interior constitution of every being, and should give character to
every thought; and while it gradually becomes more and more un

folded, it will beget in the mind an affection for an interior knowledge of present and ultimate things.  And this is therefore the highest and most perfect principle unfolded from the original Germ consisting of Power; and such is the attribute of immortal TRUTH. And
while this is the highest of the present attributes, it is a Germ that
will ascend, as all other things progress, to more perfect manifestations in higher spheres.
This, then, is an index-an introduction to the revealment of the
whole creation of the sixth day.  And its object is to prepare the
mind to associate more familiarly with the tendencies of the present
era to a corresponding day of a more perfect creation, in the investigation concerning which all the science of the world should be properly employed.  But hitherto that which has been termed science
has only been a mode by which the world has attempted to arrive at
a correct knowledge of externalforms, and barely to conceive of more
interior qualities.  Therefore that which has been termed "science"
is neither knowledge nor understanding; but has a tendency to attract
the mind from the beginning principles of Nature, and from  all the
qualities universally pervading her composition, and to enable it
merely to conceive of the shadows or sheathings of truth.  And
thus the interior cause of every external form has been obscured and
neglected.
But by the process at present adopted, knowledge becomes rigilteousness: for by it we conceive of all in a state of being below us,
and correspondingly receive impressions of that which shall be.  It
begets energy and power, and unfolds wisdom  and beauty.  It
breathes the spirit of goodness and benevolence, universal justice
and reciprocation.  It generates a dignified forbearance, unfolds a
pure and reverential regard for all eternal truths, and establishes and
constitutes a well-organized mind.  Such are the endowinents created by that knowledge which is obtained by an investigation of the
composition and developments of NATURE.
Therefore true knowledge consists in a true conception of the stupendous operations of the immortal principles originating in the
Fountain of the Omnipotent Mind!
We have now ascended to the hiighest geological formation of the
earth, all the deposites of which have been well comprehended and

previously to, and during the time of, the alluvial deposites, were

essentially different from those now existing; though particular and
incidental formations have since occurred, which have been properly
termed "superficial."  These resulted from  the depositions of the
detritus, and various solutions that were pervading the watery ele —
ment.
The formations of coral-reefs, as the ingenious work of the infusoria and polyparia, have continued to the present era-these nowt
presenting more neatness of texture, and a more perfect-composition,
than before.  And all other formations which have since been incidentally accomplished are correspondingly refined.
In the foregoing history of the earth's crust, I have acceded generally to the classifications made by geologists, but have varied in some
important particulars as relating to the general changes of the interior
and external elements as occurring at the termination of the different
periods.
~ GO. The condition of the earth at the period now under exam,
nation is atgain very different from what it was at any previous period.
The vicissitudes of the seasons were numerous and extreme, rendered so by the influence of the lines of variation and no variation
upon the fluid and ethereal elements.
Up to the commencement of the alluvial deposites, these excessive
floods or inundations, caused by the dissolving of the mountains of
ice, continued to be the same: but at the commencement of the present day, these mountains were very much decreased in size, and their
location was completely changed.  It is well to remark that many
centuries elapsed between the establishment of the first and present
conditions both in reference to the icy formations and the general
aspect of the whole earth.  The water was different only in its comnbination, the change in this element being the result of an ascension
of its ultimate particles.  Hence the weight of the whole Mass was
decreased.  Tile atmosphere had given a great portion of its carbon
to the formations of the earth, which resulted in the perfect developtnent of oxygen and nitrogen, the relative proportions of tllese being
nearly the same as at present.
It is well here to notice that the particles of atmosphere tiJ:mt are
fonnd in the envelope of the eartlr as it now is, are atoms which have
ascended firom lower conditions. And the condition of every earthy
formation is represented in the atmospheric formation: and- it will be
observed that each of the earthy strata has an ethereal or atmospheric

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 297
stratum which is in direct correspondence thereunto.  And the atmosphere is composed of as many strata, both as to its general divisions
and its subdivisions, as are found in the earth's crust.  It is evident
firom this that firom the first condensation of the granite coating, up to
the period when a new substance was produced, the water and atinosphere must have been correspondingly dense and gross in their
composition.  And the formation of every new stratum, which consisted of the ascending particles of the lower, must have resulted in a
corresponding ascension of the grosser particles of the atmosphere as
evolved and developed from the interior elements of the earth.
Thus at every epoch or day of creation, all things became essentially clanged, and adapted to the requirements of the creations of
that day.  The earth and atmosphere unfolded their interior qualities, and new laws, energies, and circumstances, were the results.
And in proportion to the perfection of these conditions and previously-undeveloped principles, were the vegetable and animal creaations made perfect.
So at the present era of the earthy and atmospheric developments,
the parity between the two remains the same.  The superficial formations which have occurred during the historical period of the earth
correspond precisely with the upper stratum of the atmosphere. This
is light, rare, and unsuited for the association of other substances,
but comprehends and unites all below its degree of refinement.  So
tile first particles of atmosphere have in reality the qualities unfolded
in the higher formations: and the first gyrate through all intermediate
conditions to the highest, and the highest unites the lower and all intermediate strata, and thus perfects the atmospheric envelope of the
earth.  This can not be demotistrated by sensuous observation,
but it can by chemical analysis, and by absolute analogy: for each
condition in the creation of the earth was subjected to perpetual
change, and so by degrees ascended to the l,'escnt condition, which
is the ultimate of the earthy deposites, and consequently the pr:esent
nust be the ultimate of the atmospheric composition.
And in this connexion it is well to remark that many species of
birds and saurians and other kindred species now existing, althoulgh
changed in form and organization, occupy the same strata of atmosphere that their lowest types originally occupied upon the earth's surface; and on principles herein involved, the extinction of many gigantic animals that dwelt in the water and upon the earth during the secondary formation may be accounted for.  For it is evident that if the

same conditions were still existing, the same forms would also have
an existence.
Therefore the modifications of the vegetable and animal lkingdorrms
correspond to those of the earth and atmosphere.  The whole, therefore, forms a perfect system —a consociated unity.  The whole constitutes an activef living, energetic Form-a source which yields
forth the most minute productions, which gyrate to the most complicated organizations, and to the individualization of the interior principle of Man.
The earth and atmosphere are in proper relations to join each
other and produce chemical actions; and the atmosphere is so far
perfected as to join to the elenment of electricity.  Therefore this
higher circulates through all the lower substances, and sympathizes
with, unites, organizes, decomposes, and recomposes, the vegetable,
animal, and atmospheric substances, existing upon and near the surface
of the earth.  And it unites all particles in being firom the igneous
composition of the interior of the eartli to the highest element of the
atmosphere.
It is known to chemists that water is only a condensation of the
same elements that compose a great part of the atmosphere, and which
would in reality be very inflammable but that their combined condition makes them unsusceptible.  Thus water is but a lower degree
of the atmosphere, and the earth is but a lower condition of the water
and atmosphere-and the whole is but the imperfection of that of
which electricity is the perfection.'These general observations are intended as a guide to an understanding of the descriptions of what follows the present dawn of a
new era; and from these remarks, the more minute productions of
the mighty and stupendous operations of Nature may be properly
conceived of and comprehended.  For this is the period of the birth
of more important organizations, leading to more important results,
than the developments of any other period of the earth's existence.
These conditions breathed into being all that composes the whole
creation as this is now manifested.  And the importance and grandeur of the forms and essences that were developed at this period
are such as are not conceived of or comprehended by the most enlarged understanding.
And it is by conceiving of the form, that we know of order; and
by order, degrees; and by degrees, correspondences. And firom the
coating-the external, visible form-the quality and essence may

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 299
ne inferred.  For it is by the essence —the interior real reality -
that all things assume forms, orders, and degrees, of tangible reality.
And inasmuch as this is a proposition set forth and established in the
Key, it is proper that it should be applied in respect to all things
that have been unfolded to the understanding since the new course
of reasoning was adopted.  And then we may test the external by
the inward reality, and say wvhether it was not by the inherent and
latent qualities of the original igneous Mass that the earth was formed
-and whether by the inconceivable combinations as forming the
outer coating, the water and atmosphere, an ascended form and substance, were not produced from the same original Mass; and whether
the atmosphere does not contain the undeveloped properties of the
imponderable element of electricity.
Let the mind, then, infer the interior essence and quality by the
external and visible form; but let it not judge entirely by the sheath
or external of that which is in the interior, undeveloped.  But it
should rest upon the inward conviction received both in reference
to the external and internal of anything, and thus the judgment would
be proper and righteous.  And as it is absolutely demonstrated that
the cause of all effects exists anterior to them, it now devolves upon
the properly-conditioned mind to judge of the interior by the external form.  For it is evident that if essence did not exist, form could
not: and if form exists, essence must of necessity be the cause of its
existence.  Essence therefore produces form by an association of its
own qualities; and thus all conspicuous forms become unfolded.
Thus it is the germ, which, when subjected to suitable conditions,
becomes impregnated by its own, latent qualities, and unfolds all the
forms and manifestations in the external world.
It is therefore a property of the embryo to develop a form corresponding to its own real reality.  And it is as impossible for the
1]e/fcct to exist before the imperfect, as it is for the highest of any
bform to be develoj ed before the germ has passed through its many
intermediate stages of unfolding, by each of which a subsequent one
is typified.  And the highest form which results from its original,
essential quality, is in reality but the highest production of the forces
and principles originally involved in the germinating essence.  So
Corres]pondence, at least as relating to these and kindred subjects,
becomes now an established science, the truthfulness of which is
perceived from its being founded upon the nature of things.

~ 61. The transition of mineral and organic substances to the first
and lowest of organic forms, is more generally exemplified in the
present era than at any anterior period.  The first classes of these
forms consist of the lower marine and land plants: for the earth was
clothed at this time with a great abundance of vegetation.  Some
parts of the dry land were better suited to sustain the higher vegetable forms than others, and these gave birth to the higher dicotiledons;
while other portions of the earth produced the class cryptogamia, and
forms beneath these descending to the lowest lichen.
All the classes of vegetation that were generally typified in the
previous period, are now exemplified and fully developed.  Various
species of the exogenous plants, and of the ferns, palms, and other
kindred orders, have, at various periods during the last day of geological formation, become entirely extinct-and others hlave been
more fully developed, and have assumed higher forms, being modified by the conditions to which the vegetation was subjected.  All
of the various grains and barleys, even to the lowest species, h'ave
become generally changed from their previous state, and rendered
more prolific and useful, by the influence which cultivation has exerted over their germinal properties.
It might therefore be stated that in the morning of the present era
the vegetable productions of the earth were very different friom what
they are at the present time, inasmuch as change of localities, conditions, and circumstances, have unfolded their more interior essences,
so that now there are in existence over two hundred species, firom
the lowest to the highest orders, that are very distinct from each other.
In the southern and eastern parts of the earth, the conditions were
more favorable for the unfolding of the vegetable productions than
they were at any other portion of the earth, or have been at any other
period.  The eastern portions were indeed exceedingly fertile, and
yielded forth nearly all the floral developments which have since
come into being in other portions adapted to their production.
In giving a general view of the kingdom which stands as a connecting link between the inorganic and animal kingdoms, it is necessary to speak of the general ascension of vegetable forms only as
such ascension has a distinct bearing upon the cor.responding forms
in the animal creation.  And as each of these forms in the vegetable
creation becomes adapted to the wants of the higher and more per —
fect organizations, mention will be made of them; and so the ad
vancement and requirements of each species may be properly com

NATURE rS DIVINE REVELATIONS.                301
prehended by understanding their mutual relations to, and dependence
upon, each other.
One fact is generally manifested in the vegetable developments
of the whole creation-and that is, their ascension from the endogenous as the first and lowest.  The latter are forms with but one surface, receiving the external particles to the internal, both by atmospheric influx and general assimilation.  This exemplifies the one
surface characterizing the first stage of actual vegetation, and answers
to the first'animal forms which only possessed a cellular tissue, corresponding to a mucous membrane.  The ultimate of this class of
plants unfolds a new and distinct coating, and thus becomes the
highest form in the vegetable kingdom.  This is the exogenous, or
that with an external coating-a chemical relation existing between
this and the inner coating whereby the inner essences are transferred
to the external, and the work of regeneration is performed.  This is
a coating that is only found in the higher orders of the animal creation, and is especially developed in the most perfect of the mammiferte.  This is the surface corresponding to the vascular tissue.
It is to be remarked that the developments in respect to these surfaces are subject to many subdivisions, and in each division is represented a new type, and apparently a new class of plants.  But all
intermediate vegetable forms are only stages in the metamorphosis
firom the primitive to the subsequent developments.  And eachi of
these forms observes the same law that governs the rudimental form.
Thus the earth has progressively unfolded and modified the primitive forms, and has perfectly adapted the essence and qualities of
one plant to the requirements of others.
The most sinple plants contain but little of the poisonous qualities; but as each succeeding generation combines new qualities, so
do the essences of the plant become complicated and poisonous.
Then, again, as the seed-bearing properties are developed, these
qualities become so changed that the plant at the period when the
flower is unfolded, sends forth a most congenial firagrance.  So from
the sweet, the sour qualities are developed; and fiom  the essence
of one of these plants, the essences of higher and more perfect plants
are unfolded.
Every form in the vegetable creation contains, in some peculiar
state of combination, the essences found in the mineral substances,
and which are developed in the animal kingdom. It is therefore evident from the same law of association that the lower orders of the





## p. 302 (#330) ############################################


302             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
vegetable creation, in becoming further developed, unfold essences
and qualities that are contained in their seed.  As the flower is the
ultimate and perfection of the interior substances of the plant, it is
also the medium through which these substances are modified so as
to assume successively-ascending forms, joining in one unbroken
chain the simple and irudimental to the higher and more perfect types:
and these possess suitable qualities to join, when properly developed,
the lowest of the animal creation.
The present epoch gave birth to many new animal forms.  The
classifications that have been made of the animal kingdom as consisting of the radiata, the articulata, the mollusca, and the vertebrata, are
comprehensive, and in a general sense true; and the relations of any
existing subordinate divisions can easily be conceived of by the enlarged understanding.
The present day ushers in more perfect forms in tile living kingdoms than any previous day of creation.  The lower orders are not
more complicated or perfect, but the higher are much more so.  For
we have now presented in Nature an external manifestation of its interior qualities; and by observing the present form, order, and degree, of creation, we see tle most perfect reflection of the undeveloped qualities contained in her interior.
~ 62. It is proper to understand, then, that the order of creation
now presented for investigation is an ultimate and full development
of all the lower forms such as were produced in Nature's previous
days.  The watery element therefore contains all forms of the fish
and reptile classes generally corresponding to those previously existing. Although some of these have been exceedingly modified according to the change of surrounding elements and circumstances,
the chain is distinctly preserved, from the lowest gelatinous form to
tile highest of the fish and reptile productions.  These also join the
land-productions, preserving an equally close relation.  From  the
fish flowed the various reptiles — which joined the bird-creation; and
these, by change of form and constitution caused only by the ushering-in of a new era of existence, run into and establish the marsupial
mammifers.  And thus the radiata, articulata, mollusca, and vertebrata, are forms and constitutions marking the various stages of the
unfolding and establishment of these distinct species.
It is well to remark, also, that all forms primitively manifest an
imperfect state of development, but that they subsequently ascend

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                303
and unfold the perfection of the species to which they belong; and
that the male of the higher orders of animals manifests the most
perfect degree of development.  And it is known by physiologists who have inquired-into the laws of embryology, that the foetus
passes through as many distinct forms as there are eras or periods
of the geological and living developments of the earth, up to the time
the same species became an existing form in the animal kingdom.
Conditions are changed in the surrounding encasement of the embryo
only in the same order of succession as.they are changed in the external world.  And so the highest perfection of fcetal development
is characterized by the nature and constitution of the male; while the
unascended or slightly-arrested utero-development establishes the female.  This law is observed, both in the vegetable and animal productions.  It is a slight arrest of the process of development that
determines the inlperfect form of the plant or animal.
The pollen, or ultimate particles of the flower, are communicated
by the surrounding elements to other plants of kindred species, and
are received into the composition of the latter through the medium
of the two surfaces, and by this process impregcnation  occurs.  And
thus by an imperceptible and mutual association of particles, plants
are rendered prolific.  And as this occurs only in the higher degrees
of vegetation, the analogous process occurs only in the higher stages
of animal development.
The same law of reproduction pervades the earthy, the mineral,
the vegetable, and the animal creations.  And in the elements surrounding, the earth the same is also exemplified, though the process
has been differently termed in the arbitrary and conventional language
of chemists.  But it is in reality by chemical action that all things,
whether in the earthy, mineral, or organic kingdoms, pass through
their various stages of formation and reproduction.
Thus the sixth day of creation evidently manifests a perpetual ascension of all previous forms, types,, degrees, and series, of each
kingdom which existed upon the earth at different periods during the
lapse of innumerable ages.  It is evident that conditions are not
changed suddenly, nor even impulsively; but they are gradually and
imperceptibly modified, so that finally a striking difference is manifest
between the first and ultimate conditions.  Therefore we see no
newly-created law, but merely an indistinct diminution of some spe.
cies, and a change in the nature and constitution of some others.
Thus the bird-creation, the marsupial, the quadrumana, and even all

304            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
that is above these, including man, apparently sustain their distinct
characters and types without any change.
But it must be admitted (for it can be absolutely proved) that animal forms of every species now upon the face of the earth have decreased in size, strength, and beauty-that there is seemingly a
general retrogression.  The mammoth, for instance, is an animal of
the present day —and the elephant is only a diminished form of the
same species.  And the unicorn, the camel, and all similar forms,
are but diminutions of larger and more gigantic animals of the same
species.  So the lion, the tiger, the hyena, and similar species, possess constitutions very dissimilar to the same species that were existing in the early periods of the present era.  So the congener, the
ostrich, the giraffe, the zebra, the leopard, and the lower aquatic
species, are in reality very much diminished in size, and are different
in anatomy, constitution, and endowments, from the previous forms
of the same species.  So the quadrumana, including all the species
of the monkey, ape, and orang-outang, ascending to the degree of
development in which the negro anatomy and constitution are typified, have degenerated absolutely in all their natures, qualities, habits,
and characters, from  those existing during the early dawn of the
present era.  So likewise'from the anatomy of the lower order of
mankind up to the highest degree of human anatomy and constitution,
there has been a declination-a lessening of form, and deterioration
of the constitution, rendering the whole of the inhabitants of the earth
comparatively weak and diminutive.
This indicates and absolutely proves the approach of evening.  It
demonstrates the comparative exhaustion of previous energies, and
presents a world of disunited and disorganized forms, that will ultimnately sink into repose, and give place to the more perfect developments of a ne.w day.
I have been impressed deeply concerning this comparative retrogression: but inasmuch as these remarks are merely incidental to an
introduction to a full and general description of the productions of
the present era, it is not now necessary to pursue them further.
But it is to be deeply impressed upon the minds of all researchers
that there is in Nature a universal Law of development, of reproduction, and of progression —and that this law has been established by
virtue of divine Beginnings, or PPrinciples, of which more will hereafter be revealed.  And let it be further impressed, as introductory
to the present analyzation and generalization of Nature and her laws





## p. 305 (#333) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   305
and their effects, that every form in being is governed by its corresponding interior principle, and is rendered perfect or imperfect according to the peculiar association of its inherent essences and qualities. Such are the laws governing the material world which is composed of forms: and the forms therein contained are the consequent
and inevitable productions of their more interior and perfected
qualities.
Thus let the philosophic mind observe Nature as a reflection of her
interior principles, but let not the reflection-the external-be considered as the reality. And let it be impressed that all interior essences tend to clothe themselves in external forms, and that thus
internal and external, which again are composed of innumerable
parts, compose a perfect Whole-and that the whole thus represents some higher degrees and more perfect forms, not yet cornprehended.
Viewed in this light, Nature demonstrates her own principles,
qualities, and interior essences; and that demonstration, too, is conveyed by a knowledge of interior and real producing causes.
I am impressed by this knowledge of Nature not to accede to thel
external scientifics of the world,'seeing that Nature should reveal heown interior truths, and that these are represented in every motlion,,
form of life, and development of sensation.  And these should be
the external indices of the interior reality.  I therefore endeavor,.
from the impressions thus received, to convey knowledge to others
through their external senses by using the various knowledges of the
world as instruments, whereby the foundation-the real reality-the
only producing cause, of all external effects, may be apprehended.
And as interior cause and external effect are manifested in all Naturei.
it is no more than proper and useful to prove one by. the inseparablo:
relation which it sustains to the other.
By these observations as illustrating general. and universal laws,.
the minds that are in a proper condition will be enabled to receive
the interior truths herein presented, and to appreciate their grandeur
and magnificence: and therefore these remarks become generally
useful.

unfolds and controls the vegetable and animal developments, I. now

the present day up to the historical era, or the time at which the observations of mankind commenced.
The earth abounded with gigantic trees, such as were larger than
any now upon its surface.  The general classes of these ranged from
the first and lowest coniferae to the highest oak, maple, and palm.
The eastern part of the earth gave birth to these more perfect forms;
but generally the vegetation of the whole earth was heavy and imperfect. There were none of the higher and more perfect forms, until
the succeeding ages unfolded conditions for their development.  I
am impressed that the earth yielded' these huge and imperfect degrees of vegetation for several successive centuries before they became distinctly modified into the types of the present period.  Yet
these productions indistinctly typified those that are now existing.
And huge and undeveloped vegetation must of necessity have been
the first upon the earth, as corresponding to all the inorganic and inanimate bodies.  And as the vegetation becomes more perfect, and
its forms and qualities become more unfolded, so also do grosser,
inorganic bodies, ascend to higher degrees of exaltation.
The pine, in the form of an exogenous plant, existed at the cornmuencement of the present era; and this at subsequent periods assumed the form  of a more perfect pine, with its modifications of
-cedar, hemlock, spruce, dogwood, and mountain rock-oak.  These
are at the present day the highest and permanent types of the lower
Land huge developments of the first ages of the present era.
The oak was then scarcely visible; for it appeared more like the
species of trees known as the boxwood, and species between it and
the pine, such as the bass and others of like nature.  But the oaks
of the eastern lands were exceedingly unlike those of any other portion.  These only became distinguished as the black, white, and red
oaks, as the climate and conditions changed, which was the imper-,ceptible work of many ages.  The maple also is a modification of
tile oak: and this assumed its character about eight hundred years
after the red oaks became established.  These pass gradually into
the higher forms of the same class, such as the birch, the chestnut,,the butternut, the hickory, the sassafias-and into the simpler trees,
such as the ferns and palms.  And it was nearly nineteen hundred
years after the development of the birch and its associated vegetation,,that the ferns and palms became perfected as they now are.  Such,were among the vegetable forms of the eastern lands.
One third of Asia, which joins nearly to the line of the Himalayah

mountains, and runs in a westerly direction to the Euphrates (whiCh
then did not exist), and extends correspondingly through into Africa,
following the same geological formations, produced forms of the vegetable kingdom more numerous and more developed than existed in
any other/ portion of the earth, or at any other period of time.  The
southern portions of the western continent also were very fertile, and
yielded forth many perfect forms, especially about the portions that
are now known as Central America, and near and about the vicinity
of Yucatan.  Many portions of land have since become dry, that
were then completely concealed by the watery element.  But such
portions as were in a condition suitable for the unfolding of vegetation, gave birth to the general classes that are yet existing as established types upon the dry land of the earth.
Many ages after this, the grasses and grains, such as the clover,
the maize, the rye, the oats, the wheat, the barley, and the rice, became also unfolded upon the properly-adapted and most fertile portions of the earth.  These were also in a very low degree of deformity and imperfection, insomuch that their representatives of the
present period would appear like an entire new creation.  For these
have been rendered perfect by surrounding and superior conditions,
and through the agency and efforts of intelligent civilization and cultivation, assisted imperceptibly by an unfolding of the internal elements of Nature.
From these, again, we have the lower forms of the flowering or
radiating class of the vegetable kingdom.  I say radiating, because
these correspond more nearly to the radiata than any other forms
in the vegetable creation —having flowers which unfold from an inferior petal, and radiate circumferently from  the axis of their form.
They develop therefore a radiating disk-a perfect flower being unfolded to the receptance of light and heat from the surrounding elements.  And of these we hlave more than two hundred and seventy
species at the present period: but these arranged in general order,
would not present more than three distinct orders or series of development.
It is to be remarked that many trees that were upon the face of
the earth in previous ages of the present day, were of this class of
the flowering forms.  And one class, especially, was over one century and a half in performing one revolution, or one period of blooming.  And the only representative which we have of this at the
present period is the one known as the;centltry-plalnt"-which

308            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
accomplishes its revolution in a much less amount of time. And
from this there is a general gradation, down to the fertile vine which
blooms every twenty-four hours.
The general characteristics of the vegetable kingdom have become
exceedingly modified from those of the previous ages. But it would
be impossible, in our descriptions, to enter into the minutim of this
imperceptible transition; for there would be no means of demonstration to the general mind, inasmuch as man is as fleeting in comparison to the duration of these forms as the ephemeron is to the duration
of man's form upon the earth.  Man thus observing the unchangeableness of the vegetable kingdom during the whole of his life's period, arrives at the conclusion that there is not and can not be any
change in the established orders and species of vegetation.  And so
generation after generation passes away, and the vegetable species
still apparently remain unchanged.  And as the historical and traditional accounts of the earth and its living forms present no evidence
of their actual modification, so the ephemeron, observing man in its
youthful period, and finally in its age and decline, would discover no
visible changes.  And generations of this would pass away, and
would leave no account of, nor perceive, any visible change in the
peculiar organization of man.  Therefore they would adopt the conclusion that the form of man was entirely unchangeable.
It is seen by this exact correspondence that sensuous observation
is not altogether the correct process of seeking for truth.  For the
conclusion of the philosopher is as erroneous as the conclusion of
the fleeting insect; and it is for want of a knowledge of the actual
duration of the forms, that they have failed to discover the truth of
the perpetual modification of the more sluggish and gross substances
and forms upon the face of Nature.
~ 64. The vegetable creations have perpetuated their orders, degrees, and qualities, from the commencement of the present era, to
the present time; and a classification of these, different from and more
definite than the one received, would be unnecessary.  And a diligent investigation and analyzation which may be prosecuted by the
energies of intelligence, would demonstrate satisfactorily the account
thus given of the earth's vegetable developments.
It is well, however, to notice the exact correspondence existing
between the mineral and vegetable formations.  The grosser metals
represent the huge and gigantic trees of the previous ages.  And as

these mineral bodies gradually ascend to higher and more perfect
degrees of refinement, so on the same principle do also the vegetable
developments. And in the highest degree of mineral composition,
we observe a parity and connexion with the more highly-perfected
formls of vegetation. And as it is impossible for bodies to be entirely
immoveable, however gross and imperfect they may be, so it is
equally impossible for the lowest and grossest forms in the vegetable
kingdom to remain unmoved, and for ever in an undeveloped state.
Nnd as the earthy formations correspond in all ages, in degrees of
refinement and perfection, to the mineral kingdom, so does the mineral to the vegetable kingdom. And these three, when joined together, form  a perfect unity-a universe of vegetable stomachs to
digest higher and more perfect substances-even to conjoin their
highest natures to the first sensitive, animal organizations.
The earth, when comprehended as an entire whole, is a stomach —
an organ of imperceptible but ceaseless digestion - of which the mineral substances constitute the ultimate and excrement.  Thus the
gross and the refined are the result of a united and concerted digestion performed by an earthy organization.  And thus the minerals
are the polygastric bodies by which the vegetable kingdom  receives
existence and life.  And the vegetable kingdom  is a universe of
polygastric parts, by which a higher creation is breathed into being.
This classification, which only presents a general view, from  the
lower productions to the vegetable formations of the earth, needs not
to be further amplified until we observe the higher orders of Nature's
developments, as these constitute mainly the objects of the present
inquiry.  And as I progress in the successive revealment of these
higher forms, the science of correspondences, which was partially set
forth in the Key, will be established and applied-so that the human mind can receive a clear conception of the uniformity and harmony of Nature's laws and productions.  And it will be a light
never yet unfolded to the world, especially when it exhibits to view
Nature's interior beauties and her Productor's perfections.  And inasmuch as knowledge, and truth, and beauty, and spirit, and heaven,
all mutually correspond to each other, so do these form a perfect and
united system, to which the truly-developed mind will be attracted by interior affection and love.  And so perfectly will all these
be radiated from  the countenance of Nature, that the mind of man
can not but thirst after an association with her interior.  Inasmuch as
the whole is a Form composed of an infinite number of forms, so are

her multifarious and stupendous operations the infinite exemplifica:ion of her interior qualities and principles.  And these will be more
distinctly observed as we ascend in the scale of organic development,
observing at the same time the anatomic and physiological truths accumulated by the unceasing efforts of some good minds, so that we
may not lose sight of our external or sensuous knowledge while
exploring the sublime recesses of Nature's interior.
By these universally-comprehensive correspondences is demonstrated the inseparable unity of all the multifarious departments of
Nature's productions. And I now proceed to consider a higher degree in the order of forms-not with the intention of establishing a
speculative hypothesis, but to indicate one of the waves of development receding from the interior Fountain of all life and activity.  In
this way the mind is wafted onward under the guidance of immortal
Truth.
The first animal forms of the present day are the simplest, like
those of the previous periods.  And these have been classified into
various species, the whole forming one group or order; and these are
similar to the types of the radiata, articulata, and mollusca, in the
lower stages of creation, such as the infusoria, polyparia, crustacea,
couchiferae, and cephalopoda. These were then, and still are, in
being.  There are various species of these orders that have been modified by the conditions of subsequent periods of the present era.
Those of the lowest order possess a form which radiates in a manner
corresponding to that of the flower, having a cellular tissue, and a
sensitive substance for its external parts.  It is therefore classed
among the radiata.
The articulata is a more complicated form  having several joints
and a heavier tissue, its various parts performing reciprocal motions.
This is the class of the animal creation whose species rise friom the
first order to the molluscs, including all the various anelidans and
piceo-saurians - these, however, being the highest -types.
The eastern and tropical parts of the world abounded exceedingly
with these forms.  And contemporary with these were all the higher
orders, such as the fish, bird, turtle, rodentia, ruminantia, plantigrade,
and digitigrade, and the inferior orders of the marsupialia and quadrumana.  These abounded in various parts of the east, and particularly
in Asia and Africa, and extended toward the northern regionswith tile exception of the birds and turtles, which, with other similar
species, existed more in the tropical portions.

There were many huge animals upon the face of the earth, such
as the mammoth, and kindred species: but each became less in size
and more refined in organization, as one order succeeded the other.
There were also, in the country now known as Arabia, many large
herds of these animals; also in the portion now known as Greenland,
which was then warm and fertile.
There were many animals upon the earth of the saurian order, and
these were of a very repulsive and disgusting nature and habit.
Some of these were very deeply red, and very poisonous.  These
inhabited alike the sea and land: but they only remained upon the
earth about three hundred and eighty years of the present day, being
destroyed by a new association of elements which were as destructive to them as they were adapted to the requirements and uses of
higher forms.
The mammoth and kindred forms (lid not remain upon the earth
after the first two thousand years.  These gradually decreased in
number, and finally the whole order became nearly extinct, a few
only remaining, the fossils of some of which are found in caves and
icebergs.
There was a kind of animal nearly representing the elephant in
form and disposition, but which was very much larger, and formed a
link between the mammoth and the elephant.  A species of this has.been discovered, which has been termed the mastodon.  These existed about two thousand five hundred years, and, like the others,
finally became extinct.
~ 65. I am impressed with the reason why these higher gigantic
animals passed at successive periods firom the face of the earth.
They were many ages in being, especially before they arrived at their
higher degree of formation and became an established order of animals.  And in the early periods of the sixth day, after they had arrived at this state, they migrated to various parts of the earth, and
thus at times became entirely separated frotn each other.  Reproduction thus became limited, and finally entirely ceased.  And so
one after another died, and the order became extinct.
I am impressed that many species not known to naturalists, both
of this and other orders, were also existing upon the earth, and likewise became extinct.
The opinion which has been nearly universally received concerning
the destruction of these lower animals is altogether unwarrantable and,

312            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIO.NS.
unfounded.  These were not swept from the face of thie earth by any
catastrophic occurrence, nor by any circumstances which some misinterpretations of the primitive history have led the minds of the world
to suppose existed.  But the cessation of their existence occurred
from the causes before explained; and no other cause can be demonstrated to have produced this effect.
Therefore the Radiata, Articulata, Mollusca, and Vertebrata, existed, as geologists have determined, upon the earth at the commencement of the present era.  These are in reality the four great classes
in the animal kingdom-though the radiata and rmollusca might be
blended together as forming one, which might be termed the molliscoradiata.  This would reduce the animal kingdom  to three general
classes, which would constitute a perfect unity.
Many ages elapsed before the elephant and kindred animals assunmed their present degree and form  of organization.  They were
formerly very much larger, but not essentially different in their mental- constitutions.  One species after another of these also passed
from  the earth, and gave room  to new and kindred forms, before
they assumed anything near the form  and character that they now
possess.
There are many caves now in the eastern and southern parts of
the world which contain the remains of many of these forms of which
I speak.  The mastodon has been discovered standing in an erect position in the mouth of a cave; for it was the nature of this and other
animals to conceal themselves in such places when they were becoming rather diminished in numbers.
There was a certain condition of the sea at one period in whlich,
by a strange and peculiar chemical process, substances were united
together and ultimately became condensed, and were thrown by the
waves upon the shores.  Such substances are now termed amber.
These contain many minute insects, being transparent and beautifully
crystallized.  These existed upon the earth at one time in great
abundance.  Some portions of dry beach land were entirely covered
with these crystallized substances, and presented a beautiful, pearlywhite appearance.  They gave birth to no vegetable forms.  These
amber forms remained the same for many ages, and some are still in
being.
About this time there were various animal species of the order
quadruzmana.  These admit of various subdivisions, the higher being
near the most perfect orang-outang of the present day.  The indi

viduals of the whole order were very much larger than any similar
fornis now existing, their stature even exceeding that of man. These
were very fond of the water, though they were in nature equally
adapted to the land.  It was not many ages before these nearly all
became extinct; and it is remarkable that almost every one of these
died in the watery element, and thus deposited its fossils on the bottom of the sea.
There were but very few types which represented the lion, tiger,
wolf, and bear, these being a much later creation.  Some of the saurian and other lower tribes of the eastern countries possessed very
much of their dispositions, but they did not in the least present a
true type of these higher forms.  The various animals of the rodentia nature dwelt mostly on the southern islands, and where the fruit
upon which they subsisted was most abundant.
I am impressed with many and various changes that occurred in
the two kingdoms in the beginning of the present era-more even
than geologists have conceived of in considering all the previous days
qf creation.  Many distinct orders of animals dwelt upon the face
of -the earth, and passed quietly away without even leaving a vestige
of their existence behind.  Each of these became extinct because of
changes in surrounding conditions, which also were the immediate
causes of their fiequent migrations from  each other to various parts
of the earth.
To the superficial observer there would have been a confusion in
creation because of the dissimilarity of forms, natures, dispositions,
habits, and various other peculiarities, which characterized the animal creation in the early periods of the sixth day.  Some were entirely herbivorous, and others entirely carnivorous; and each one
pursued its own peculiar inclinations: and a world of huge, gigantic
animal forms was presented, devouring each other and the vegetable
productions.
The rumuinating animals were at first not very abundant; but they
became more so about the fourth period, which was about the third
thousand years.  Those that were upon the earth existed mainly in
Switzerland, but extended through all the European countries. They
did not form a type identical in any particular with the forms of the
present day.
* Thus all the lower and first animal productions were, like the first
of the vegetables, huge, gigantic, and undeveloped-corresponding
to the density and imperfect state of the water and air which then

.314           NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
surrounded the earth.  These species were so numerous, that it
would be impossible to reduce them to any definite arrangement
whereby they could be properly comprehended.  For there are none
now existing that bear their likenesses, and none that may be compared with their external form.  Furthermore, a definite knowledge
of these would not be of much importance to the world, and its application would be of no benefit, either in satisfying the requirements
of the scientific world, or assisting the minds of those who are endeavoring to understand the more perfect interior principles.
~ 66. I come now to a stage of creation in which the lower types
of Mankind are distinctly exemplified.  Xnd of these I am impressed
to speak particularly, and to trace them  connectedly and with rather
more minuteness than the other degrees of creation have been traced.
And this will be done in order to impress the understanding with the
important truth displayed in the first ascension of interior principles
to the individualization of the inner man.
Harmony of anatomical structures and similarity of compositions
are principles largely pervading the animated kingodonls.  It has
been a subject of much discussion among the minds of the world,
whether there is any established law by which forms are recreated by
the successive modifications of the original form-and whether, by
the same process, the species reproduced by all the living kingdoms
become modified at each period, according to prevailing conditions.
But the basis of reasonino which has been assumed in relation to
this point has not been correct, and researchers have not been generally fortunate in the conclusions which they have deduced from the
visible appearances of Nature at the present day.
Before speaking of the type of anatomy that exemplifies partially
the form of man, it is well to remark that Nature is like the human
brain —and is incessantly producing forms, as the brain is thoughts.
And each form and peculiar organization in Nature is determined by
the existing, controlling circumstances, which were the cause of such
form's creation.  It is therefore impossible for any order of animals
to remain for many periods the same as its original: for they are
changed in accordance with the existing surrounding circumstances.
So also the thoughts to which the mind gives birth are the forms of
their creating causes.  And it is no more impossible for the brain
to produce constantly thoughts in every particular similar to each
other, than it is for Nature to prodrce forms similar to each other





## p. 315 (#343) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  315
For the mind is acted on by all the immediate and exciting causes
which produce thoughts as an effect, and the effect always varies according to the variations of the cause.  So forms are the thoughts of
Nature, as thoughts are the forms of the mind.  Thus, although a
general law governs the creation of thoughts, this does not produce
invariableness in theform of thoughts.  Here, then, it is well to rest
the present discussion: for it is not useful to enter into minutia concerning the modifications of animal forms; and these all must be understood as the results of efficient causes, not at the present time
manifest to the sensuous observation of mankind.
At the present period of creation, which is the first part of the
sixth day, the quadrumnana that existed were very differently formed
from  those now existing, and their stature and strength exceeded
those of man at the present day.  They resembled very much those
that were described as existing upon the planet Saturn.  Their body
was short and heavy, their limbs disproportionately long, and their
hleads of a very wide and low form.  The spinal column in the early
species resembled more nearly that of the fish than that of any other
form.  The shoulders were of great width, and the neck was very
short and full.  The whole body was covered with thick, heavy hair,
like many of the plantigrades of thlat period.  Some parts of the
body of this quadrumana resembled those of the lower animals, such
as the fore limbs, which were used always in walking. The trunk bore
some resemblance to those of the lower saurian species, and the head
nearly represented a combination of forms that were then existing
upon the earth. Some of the fossils of these animals have been discovered, and they have been supposed to belong to a branch of the saurian species-also to some of the marsupial mammalia.  This animnal was the first type, after many ages of regeneration, which resembled in any particular the form of man. And the resemblance was
in the peculiar form of the shoulders, back, and hips; but it resembled other animals in its extremities and main features.
This animal, like the classes previously mentioned, developed the
positive and negative forces of the organs, and the proper functions
of each organ were developed. Its lungs were very full and large,
and were divided into two lobes.  The heart contained four chambers (these, however, being imperfectly formed); the brain imperfectly performed a duality of coricular motions, but it consisted of
one mass without divisions.  The liver in them was that which is
termed spleen in the human form  and the stomach more represented





## p. 316 (#344) ############################################


316            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the kidneys than the stomach of man, it being partly an organ of digestion, though the latter office was performed more by the general
action of all the visceral organs.
This animal also had the internal and external surfaces of every
organ, nerve, and muscle, lined by the mucous and serous coatings
which generate the higher forces of the whole body.  The muscular
system was very powerful, the osseous portions were very gross in
composition, and the cerebral portions were such as are connected
with an undeveloped mental constitution.  It possessed no thoughts
that were not caused by the sensations of the body.  Thus, though
motion, life, and sensation, were all unfolded in this animal's organization, the higher endowments were as yet unknown; for there was
no mental organization capable of developing intelligence.
I am impressed distinctly that this class of animals remained upon
the earth nearly nine hundred years, during which time the physical
elements experienced many changes, which at length resulted in the
production of a higher form of the same class.
This new species, that now fills the place of the previous one,
ascends one degree in the order of organic development.  The animal of this species had a head much larger than that of the former
species, though it was but little differently shaped.  It possessed
shoulders of similar highness, and an elongated spine, with a sacralbone nearly like that of the ichthyosaurus.  The extremities resembled partially those of the bear and partially those of the human being: but they used them all in walking, which made them like the
plantigrade in habit, though they were like the bimana in some other
respects. This form could not have existed, except as a progressive
unfolding of the previous form.
After many physical changes had occurred, this same species also
gave place to a new form.  This, like the other, was a very dark,
gigantic, and powerful animal, but it was not so gross as the previous
species of the same order.  The anatomy was somewhat differently
constructed, and was adapted to a new use.  Tile action of the whole
visceral system was very perfect. The form displayed a full, plump
sternum, head, and extremities, as are observed in the lower order
of mankind. The spine was also more perfectly formed: it was not
like the first fish-like spines, but fully vertebrated, and gave off, at
every intermediate portion, ganglionic nerves as receptacles for unexpended fluid; and by these the wllole body was kept in an active
condition.  The bones were filled with marrow.  The brain was





## p. 317 (#345) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                317
very large and very inactive.  The heart was imperfectly developed,
but acted more perfectly upon the organs which were in close rela.
tion to it and the lungs than did the hearts of the previous species
The brain, by its heavy and sluggish action, gave beginning and
birth to the nervous fluid: and by its contraction the system was
charged with nervous energy; and by its expansion, imperfect particles that were existing in other portions of the system were drawn
to the brain to be modified, and thereby new life in each portion was
constantly generated.  This animal did not develop the forces necessary for the full unfolding of all interior qualities; but inasmuch as
its forces had ascended from those of the primitive species of the
same class, so they were adapted to unfold themselves and to give
birth to new and higher formns, such as were subsequently created.
~ 67. The creation of a new species soon followed the destruction
of the one just described.  This, again, assumed a more perfect
form, and its anatomy more resembled that of the lower order of mankind.  Its head and body were not so large.  The spine and itappendages were very differently constructed, and the extremities
became now so modified that it used but two of its limbs in walking.
In the species before existing the hands and feet were nearly alike,
but the hands of this resembled those of a species of the marsupials
that then existed — and the feet still those of the digitigrade, with the
exception of having more complicated parts.  And there was a decided distinction thus formed between the habits of this species and
those of the lower species of the same class.  The whole structure
of the body manifested an adaptation of parts to new and more per
0:.= uses.
There is a law running through this system of comparative anatomy, not perceived in a superficial view of the order of creation. For
the historical period is the only one wherein all investigations are
made, and all inductions and hypotheses are established.  The inquirer, therefore, is like a person standing at the termination of a
great water, and questioning its origin and its manner of forming itself into so large a body.  But if the mind could be carried back to
the beginning principles, and then follow each law and order of development through all the successive changes, the connexion between
the present degree of organization and the lower animated forms
could be distinctly seen. And then each form would be to the mind
an index of its own origin, and from it the future development of





## p. 318 (#346) ############################################


318            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
higher forms and more perfect qualities could be inferred. Then
the activity of creation would be considered as a result of the energies contained in the First Principles, which have been heretofore
explained.
There is now a decrease in the species of the quadrumana; and
decrease of forms indicates a composition of more refined materials.
Thus the present class has less hair upon the surface of the body;
the shoulders are not so high; the spine now becomes nearly of the
same form, even to the os-coccyx, which joins more perfectly the
sacral-bone through which run the posterior nerves which give
strength to the muscles and tendons of the extremities.  Then, again,
all the systolic and diastolic motions are much more in harmony with
what is conceived to be the condition of a favorable and healthy constitution.  These are controlled by the forces generated by the mucous and serous surfaces, which are adapted to the digestion and
generation of a positive and negative fluid, and which also develop
the most perfect mode of reproduction.  Thle little hair that was upon
their surfaces indicates, as does their general composition, more refined ingredients.  Therefore the whole body constitutes the first
type of a species far below the negro inhabitants of the earth as now
existing.
Depreciation of this species was a result of subsequent periods,
and finally this gave place to a new species.  And it may be observed that I only mention the prominent species of each class, and
that the subdivisions are not particularly noticed, inasmuch as if minutice were specified, the great and leading characteristics of these
orders of creation would be rendered less conspicuous.
The species that we now have upon the earth may be properly
termed a quadrumana also, and is a progressed succession of the last
species.  This inhabited the eastern lands, especially the parts of
Africa and Asia that corresponded in latitude, and which were only
divided by the ocean.  It inhabited in greatest abundance the parts
of the earth where the marsupials generally dwell.
We have now a different type of anatomy, and in many particulars
a new plan of organization.  The head is not so large as in the previous species, but assumes a more oblong shape, and joins very
closely the medulla oblongata. And the medulla spinalis more distiIctly proceeds from the above portion, forming four cervicle nerves,
these again extending into dorsal and lumbar, being very indistinctly
ramified, as is the case in the higher order of the bimana. The whole

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 319
vertebrated column was seemingly more adapted to higher uses than
any form  previously dwelling upon the earth's surface.  The jawbones were of great length, the mouth was large and distended, the
cheek-bones were prominent, and the head greatly represented those
of several of the feline tribe.  The nose was very broad and flat, the
brows were full, and the eyes were rather inclined to the top of the
nose.  The chest and the whole viscera system were very imperfectly formed, but represented in their main features the body of the
Caffers.  Their limbs were long, slender, and rather bowed.  The
feet were rather more oblong, and the ankle gave off parts which
better adapted the feet to locomotion.  The body was generally very
full and gross in appearance.  It was nearly free from the heavy hair
which grew upon the previous classes.  The hair upon the neck and
head was somewhat more heavy, but it was very short and dark.
Their color was generally an inveterate black.  This class existed
upon the earth nearly seven hundred years, during which time the
whole of the animal kingdom assumed imperceptibly a higher degree
of refinement.
The following prominent degree of organization was that of a large,
gigantic form, ascendinrg to within one decree from  the first estab
lished human inhabitants of the earth.  It is well to remark that the
portions of the earth where these existed were constantly undergoing
specific modifications according to the condition of the interior of the
earth, and its surrounding physical elements.  And it is not necessary to discuss the transformation of colors; for it will be seen by an
explanation hereafter to be given, that all colors are homogeneous
with the first and lowest —and that if the first is subjected to proper
conditions, the succeeding  1lors will be unfolded (varying only as
combinations differ): and thus will be displayed all the complexions
in the animal creation, and all the living and blooming beauties of
the vegetable kingdom.
This next class ascends to a degree in the scale of animal formation that may be properly termed an ultimate representation of all
living things.  In this form  the bimnana organization becomes more
distinctly visible.  The heart and lungs in this animal assume a
higher degree of development than those of any of the previous species.  Being well formed in its main portions, it is still better calculated to generate active, living forces, and thereby approaches nearer
to the capacity of mental perception and intelligence- although its
organization is a compound-even a transmuted ascension-of

320             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
lower forms. And however indistinct the modifications may appear
to sensuous observers, this does not alter the truth of the general law
whereby elements and forces constantly and successively unfold more
perfect developments and higher states of exaltation.  How  easy,
therefore, is it to perceive the anatomical and physiological correspondence which seems to be manifested in every order and degree
of Nature's productions!
Besides a well-formed viscera system, this animal possessed a more
perfect form of the spinal column —it being more minutely vertebrated, and giving off more motor nerves, which, by entering into a
portion of the ganglionic system, contributed to the perfection of the
whole internal apparatus, enabling it to digest more perfect substances
as constituting its food.  And this is the first type by which a true
conception is conveyed of the power of the mutual living forces.
For it must be discovered that the animal forms, as they become
more fully developed, combine more forces within their organization.
Thus the form corresponds to the interior power of motion, motion
to the nervous life, and this to the active and susceptible sensation that
pervades the serous and cellular tissues of the whole body.  Thus
these three forces become, when properly perfected, the first indication
of intelligence, termed by naturalists " the instinct of animals."
The form of the head in this animal was very little dissimilar to
that in the previous species.  Its brain was smaller, but more complicated, and therefore more susceptible. The color was not changed;
the hair upon the head and body was similar; the long and ill-shaped
limbs continued, and also the short, full body.  Various species of
these animals inhabited Asia and Africa.  Being yet animals, they
were highly susceptible to the influenceIo  f external circumstancesmore so, indeed, than any other order of animals.  They were of
great stature, had great power of will, and possessed strong passions,
as owing to the highly-susceptible inclinations inherent in their constitutions.
It is well here again to remark, that where Sensation becomes perfectly established, passions, inclinations, and susceptibility to all external influences, become greater than at any inferior stage of animal
development.  For it is by the interior sensibility arising from  the
medium existing upon the serous and mucous surfaces, that all the
interior characteristics, which are sensations and passions, become
strong, and therefore more extensively manifested.
These animals, to the present inhabitants of the earth, would ap

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                321
pear like giants in form and stature. Indeed, they were larger than
any similar forms now upon any portion of the earth. These were
the first that displayed any indication of mental activity.  They were
so formed that it became convenient for them to use distinct sounds
which were significant to the minds of those addressed.  These
sounds were produced by the throat; but they did not yet possess a
glottis and tongue that could serve as vocal organs.  The sounds
produced were somewhat like those made by some species of the
feline tribe, but in no particular did they resemble those used in human vocal intercourse.
These animals were distinguished from all others in habit and disposition.  They even had a conception of rearing artificial structures
wherein they might reside-and they often inhabited caves: but they
generally, like the lower species of the same order, dwelt upon the
surface of the earth.  They did not possess any of the aquatic or
amphibious characteristics.  Therefore it is manifest that they were
more refined in form, in degree, and in disposition, than any of the
previous classes or orders in the animal kingdom.  These dwelt
undisturbed upon the earth nearly one thousand years.
~ 68. The degree of organization which subsequently took their
place, was the first form that approached or indicated in the least degree
any of the peculiar characteristics of mankind; and these represented
the Jalofs and Mandingoes in their lower degree.  T'hese were upon,
the earth, without any essential modification, nearly eight hundred,
years.
After this, three successive and distinct orders pressed in their
stead.  The highest of these appioached in every particular the mored
perfect form of the human organization.  These inhabited the Asiatic
continent, while the other portions of the same class were in the
south of these regions.  Thus the three continents-the southernr.
western, and eastern —were inhabited by three distinct tribes, the
highest of which, existing in Asia, came nearer to the unfolding of
intellectual endowments.  And this brings the period of the sixth!
day of creation to a point three thousand and eight hundred years
before the commencement of the race as referred to in the primitive,.
written record.
The surface of the earth, particularly in Asia and Africa, was now
much more progressed, and consequently more fertile and suitable:o the reqnlirements of the animal creation.  And it was.at tlhis tifmvl





## p. 322 (#350) ############################################


322            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
that the inhabitants of Asia began to unfold a distinct and sensuous
perception, and even to represent their perceptions to one another.
Having no proper conception of higher beauties than those surrounding them, they consequently remained in their unintellectual state for
nearly one thousand years, during which time the earth underwent a
material change, which resulted in the destruction of nearly all the
various tribes of the bimana type, and also materially altered the geographical and geological condition of the whole earth.
And it was by the passing away of the old conditions that new
and more perfect ones came into being, whereby a new order of
creation was produced, the highest of which ascends to the type exemplified in the present human organization.  Until this period vegetation was comparatively imperfect and limited; but after this, each
portion of the earth was rendered fertile and fragrant with living
beauty.  The earth at no previous time brought forth productions so
extensive, or yielded so many delicate forms of vegetation; for now
it presented an external expression of its interior excellences.  The
whole earth was fertile, and the eastern countries abounded with
more beauty and living grandeur than they do at the p1resent day.  It
mnay be supposed that these beauties could not have existed without
the agency of man in their cultivation.  But the most beautiful and
complicated forms in the vegetable kingdom, as in the animal, become developed in a more perfect degree whin they are not artifi-.cially cultivated.
And it was at this time that a new tribe was introduced upon the
earth —rising entirely above the undeveloped features of the lower
forms.  These constituted what may be properly termed a transition
from the animal to man: and these were the first forms that could be.properly termed Man.
And the record which reveals the then-existing condition of the,earth is distinctly proved and exemplified; for the beauties of creation, displayed in all the parts of Asia and Africa that were fertile,,represented not only the interior qualities contained in the earth, but
also the primitive conception of the garden of Eden.
And it will be understood from this that all the vegetable and animal productions ascend gradually and imperceptibly with the unfold*ings of the law of Nature, from the original gelatinous composition to
tthe creation of man at the present period.  And, again, it is evident
that man was formed " fiom the dust of the earth" -was rendered
iman only by the congregation of innumerable living forms, which

assumed orders, degrees, species, associations, and correspondences.
And thus he occupies a degree of organization pre-eminent above all
the other departments of creation, and thus is a representation of all
living things that contained the germ of which he is the unfolding.  He
is thus a combination of all forms, qualities, and essences, in Nature,
sustained by all kinds of motion, life, and sensation, that characterize
the successive steps of natural progression.  Thus it is that man is
over all creation. And as he represents the developed beauties contained in the louer forms, so is he a representative of the interior
world.
The written history speaks of the multiplying of each form of the
sea, land, and air.  And all these were subjected to the control of
man, while man was actually dependent upon all below and around
him in being.  For while he is the unlimited proprietor of his own
person, the whole creation below his exalted degree is necessary to
his subsistence and nourishment.  And inasmuch as there is an in
separable dependence of man upon every form in being, and of these
mutually upon each other-so are the harmony and perfection of all
things dependent upon the reciprocations of the vegetable and animal
kingdoms and man, and of man and the interior and more congenial
world.
Here, then, we rest satisfied.  Man is created, and exerts a power
over all creation.  And the present developments of the whole Universe are in accordance with all the associated laws that flow spontaneously from the Fountain of divine and living Principles.  They
are even the breathings of the Great Positive Mind which has flowed
through the ten thousand avenues and forms of animated Nature, until
it breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living soul!
~ 69. Now is revealed the whole use of Nature; and now can be
perceived the adaptation of every part belonging to the whole 1Mass,
to produce a more exalted form-which, again, is adapted to the
unfolding of far greater and eternal beauties.  And all the laws and
forces which have been heretofore explained, are now plainly understood as converging to the formation of man.  Man, then, represents
the universal progressive development which is an inherent and eternal law of matter: also he represents a resurrection of every gross
material in being.  And the saying that is contained in the Key is
now verified, that'; Nature is the Cause; forms are the Effects, and
man is the Ultimate production;" and that "'the Great Positive

324            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Mind, as a Cause, uses Nature as an Effect, to produce Spirit as an
Ultimate."
These things are represented in every particle in being, and therefore can be comprehended by a proper investigation of the rudimental laws and principles of the Universe - without which no important
truth can ever be unfolded to the minds of the world.
The work of the present day of creation has been more distinctly
marked by unity of plan and composition, and the appearance of a
general end, cause, and effect, than that of any previous day. A
superficial view of the whole plan of creation of mankind, however,
would lead to many erroneous and repulsive impressions. But when
viewed with a scientific and reverential mind, the whole presents
a connected plan and a sublime and magnificent work, inasmuch as
every particle is a flowing of the interior qualities of previous existences: and each, again, as it ascends into higher forms, displays a
higher degree of the same interior excellences. And so from one
order of creation to another, in which the species are only mediums
of transferring inferior qualities to higher states, there is to be seen
the same united activity, the same potent energies, and the same
teeming beauties; and as the confluence of all these establishes and
constitutes the organization of man, man becomes the perfection and
representative of them all.
So by these harmonious breathings of Nature, the work of the
present day manifestly becomes a higher example of omnipotent and
divine Love and Wisdom. And this is the closing of the present
era-the consummation of the creations of the whole period, and of
the End contemplated; and thus Nature represents a higher beauty,
a more perfect form, and a more comprehensive organization. These
things, when viewed in connexion with the united harmony of the
Universe, display wisdom which transcends the powers of human expression.  Indeed, there is no mind adequate to appreciate the wisdom here displayed, save the Great, Comprehensive MIND whose
Essence pervades every particle throughout space!
And nothing is too low in the scale of being to be of indispensable
importance in the position it occupies.  Moreover, nothing is so low
but that it is the perfection of something still lower.  And the lowest
particle in being is only a representative of an endless use and adaptation. Nothing therefore is useless: for that which appears gross
and imperfect is in reality the only substantial source of subsequent
unfoldings. Thus a condensation of an inconceivable congregation





## p. 325 (#353) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 325
af atoms produced only the imperfect form of the earth.  And it is
plain that if this condition had not existed, the vegetable kingdom
could not have been developed.  And so the vegetable creation is a
substantial basis for the animal creation, even as the earth is for the
vegetable.  And the animal kingdom  is the only basis upon which
man could have been created, and therefore it is absolutely necessary
to his being.
And had not each of these been governed by the unchangeable
laws of Nature, nothing would have assumed order or refinement.
But by the operation of these laws the whole creation gradually ascends, by imperceptible steps, to the perfect development of its own
interior nature.  Thus the germ of existence is in Nature, and the
fruit thereof is Man.  Thus the vegetable mirrors the undeveloped
qualities in the earth, and represents the animal kingdom.  This,
again, reflects the beauties of the vegetable kingdom, and represents
the formation of Man.  And man exemplifies the perfect unfolding
of Nature's interior qualities, and represents within himself the united
and harmonious Universe.
From these correspondences it can be plainly seen that all things
vlhich have form  and distinct existence have an interior independence, but that externally they are dependent on all things, and display a universal use.  And it would be as unjust to abhor any of the
lower kingdoms as it would be to have a prejudice against any of the
imperfect portions of the human organization.  For forms are only
the temporal combinations of material substances; but the Cause (of
which forms are the effects) is the invisible and therefore is eternal.
And as forms, the uses of which the mind does not always comprehend, are the constant manifestations of Nature, so they are the constant and successive productions of her immutable and eternal prin
ciples.
And the first and most comprehensive attribute that is manifested
in these forms is divine Wisdom.  And their unity and harmonious
reciprocation prove that Wisdom is the higher attribute flowing fi'om
the Fountain of divine Love.  Love, therefore, determines the universal relationship, and Wisdom the universal adaptation.  So these attributes are the highest laws of Nature, comprehending within themselves various modifications of the same principles as all flowing
from the same exhaustless Fountain wherein exists infinite Intelli
gence.
This is the Vortex from which are unfolded successively the re.

ceding waves of a united Universe. And one of these is an index
to the expanding sublimnities of another; and so their ceaseless flowings comprehend the whole Univerccelum. And as these are the
flowings of the general materials in space, so the earth constitutes a
similar vortex of power, which rolls forth succeeding waves frorn the
mineral to the vegetable, to the animal, and to man: and the breathings of inherent qualities transcend Motion, Life, and Sensation, and
form a pure and exalted Spirit.  The wave of development is not
arrested here, but it goes on throughout the unimaginable spheres in
the interior world, until it approximates and is responded to by the
Great Positive Mind.  Thus are the concentric circles of material
creation unfolded- which correspond to, and absolutely prove, the
concentric circles of spiritual creation and spiritual, endless progression!
~ 70. Thus the great Vortex is a living, exhaustless Fountain,
wherein dwell infinite Love and Wisdom, and from which flow the
undefinable worlds which pervade the whole Univerceelum.  And
these are formed by succeeding and expanding waves, the same
principle being distinctly manifested in every department of animated
Nature.  The Universe, therefore, is an ocean of activity, even as
the Univerecelum is a boundless ocean of infinite Love and Wisdom.
The Thoughts of the infinite Mind, therefore, constitute the laws
of Nature: and the results of these thoughts are the animated forms
in being, including the exalted form of man —which again form, on
a corresponding principle, the interior, spiritual existence.  Nature,
therefore, is merely a Th.ouglht of the divine Mind, as forms are the
thoughts of Nature.  Thus the universal laws are merely the infinite
expressions of the Great Positive Mind.-And thus are we brought
to associate our interior principle with the Thoughts of its own Productor.
And it is only by a clear comprehension of Nature's creations that
we can form any correct conception of even a Thought emanating
from the divine Mind.  The laws of Nature are known to be unchangeable; and these are merely the expressions of divine Thoughts.
These laws, therefore, are emanations fiom the universal Cause; and
by resting upon their immutable and harmonious results, we would
be resting our interior affections upon the Thoughts of an all-pervading, infinitely-perfect, omnipotent Mind.
It is seen by this that universal truth displays a universal corre

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  327
spondence.  All things, therefore, are existing externally in forms,
but all realities are dwelling in the interior, and are the cause of the
form's existence.  Thus it is necessary for the living principle of
man to have an external form: for the two mutually depend upon
each other.  Without the form, the spirit could not be: and without
the spirit, there could be no form.  Therefore the interior is the
reality, and the form is a useful, rudimental instrument, agent, or
medium, by which the spirit forms a connexion with the material
Universe.
So tile animal and vegetable forms are necessary for the unfolding
of their interior qualities. Tile external coating of the earth is a form
necessary to contain the interior, living Mass; and without it, this
Mass would be in a chaotic condition.  So it is necessary for the
Sun to be clothed with a form like the planetary system, in order that
one body may balance another, and that the whole may thus be in
unity and reciprocation.  The Sun being the interior and producing
cause, its evolved forms constitute the united external Form.  So the
whole Univerecelum  is necessary as a Form-a Body —of the
Great Positive Mind.  This living Principle is the all-producing
Cause, and the Univerccelum is the universal Effect.  Thus the latter fornis an External, which is necessary for the existence of the
Interior.  And thus the whole creations of boundless space are only
an external Form  assumed by the interior qualities of the divine
Mind.
If, then, it is impossible to understand the uses of the minute forms
in Nature, is it not more impossible to comprehend the extent of an
infinite thought?-and still more impossible to comprehend that
thought's Originator?  It is not well, then, to doubt the existence
of a use in any department of Nature; for this would be evidence
that the subject is not yet properly understood.  And it is only when
the exalted and sweeping intellect puts forth all its powers to grasp
the whole united plan-work of Nature's creations, that a very indistinct idea is obtained of that which infinitely transcends all adequate
conception.  So nothing is inactive —nothing useless-nothing absolutely imperfect; but everything sustains an important position in
the great architecture of the Univerccelum.
These meditations are the result of the breathings of the sphere of

present. And these effects are exemplified in every minute particle,
constituting an inseparable chain of correspondences ascending to the
highest celestial spheres, which are illuminated only with divine Love
and Wisdom. All that is around, below, above, is to my mind an
harmonious congregation of forms and spheres, of laws and principles, which are in every particular displaying the original design of
the infinite and omnipotent Mind.  So no thought is so extensive or
so profound as to comprehend the infinite expanse of divine creations.
Nature, at this period of creation, presents a most beautiful reflection of all anterior creations.  And it is now evident that man is created from the dust of the earth, and that he is the receptacle of one
of the spontaneous breathings of the Great Positive Mind.  This
rendered him a perfect form  -a useful agent-a living soul.  And
thus were male and female created; and these were qualified to exercise an unlimited control over all the lower orders of being, even
as man feels his absolute dependence upon them.  And -o the whole
earth at this time represented the close of a distinct and pre-eminent
creation, even the peopling of the garden of Eden.  As this represents the living beauties in the vegetable kingdom  at this period, so
do the inhabitants thereof represent the perfection of animated forms.
Thus the grand Work is finished -the great En d is accomplished.
Nature becomes an harmonious Whole-the congregation of parts.
And so the original expression which was made in view of the general consummation of the present period of creation, is absolutely
verified. -And as Nature is a mirror wherein are seen all her interior
excellences, so this ultimate development of creation is a mirror
wherein is reflected the truthful expression that I the evening and the
morning were the sixth dlay."
~ 71. The germ of man has thus been discovered in the lowver
forms of the animal kingdom, and traced through all of its progressive stages of development, rising firom  the lower degrees through
the great body of the animal creation, with its many and diversified
branches and their modifications, up to the blooming perfection of
the living tree whose fiuit is the organization of man.  And as man
is the fr uit of the whole living creation, so is he the rudimental being
possessing those undeveloped endowments which have subsequently
civilized many portions of the earth, and also opened to the mental
view the reality of an interior and more perfect world.
The present existence of man was within and near the portion of

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                329
Asia which has since been termed Turkey, extending to the regions
of the Euphrates and Tigris, and joining in two distinct lines to the
locality whereupon was built Jerusalem.  As was stated, the lower
type was existing in some portions of Africa, but these were as inferior comparatively as were the felina and general mammalia of those
regions.  The great body of those of the most perfect form, and
which were truly man, thus dwelt originally upon the borders and in
the interior of Asia.
Their form was very large, their strength was in proportion to the
great density of their osseous composition, and their motions were
governed by the peculiar plan of their anatomical structures.  The
spinal column was perfectly vertebrated.  The sternum and intercostal portions were so arranged as to give great elasticity to the interior
and depending portions.  They'were marked by a peculiar gentleness and humiliation, such as resulted firom the more agreeable instincts of the lower and kindred forms.
There was still a slenderness and imperfect form of the limbs,
these being somewhat bowed and still resembling the extremities of
lie previous classes.  Their mental constitutions (of which more will
hereafter be said) were not intellectual so much as social, but they
were characterized by great power of perception and memory. They
did not display any noble moral qualities such as were manifested
in the subsequent races.
Male and female thus existed, differing only in stature and strength,
in accordance with the plans of their respective organizations.  This
was the first class of beings that could properly be termed mankind:
for they now exemplified, though imperfectly, all that the human organization has in subsequent ages unfolded.
The portion of the earth where they dwelt was at this time very
fertile, yielding forth many species of vegetation.  Thus this portion
of the earth was more adapted to the requirements of man than any
other; and corresponding to its advanced condition were its animal
developments.
This, with the lower and kindred races, has been designated by
the comprehensive term Adamn-as was their associate tribe comprehended by the term Ecc-these terms representing the first and
he basis of the more perfect inhabitants.
Their dispositions were exceedingly gentle and social, varying in
some particulars, owing to the imperfect reproduction of their species. Asia was thus peopled for many ages, during which time no

mechanical improvements were made. They had no conceptions of
the arts and sciences, nor of the intellectual attainments possessed by
the subsequent and higher orders of the same class.
At first, and for many continuous ages, they communicated their
ideas by cxjressions of the countenance and outward physical signs;
and while they remained unsophisticated by the art of clothing their
ideas in verbal sounds, they were free fiom all cupidity and absolute
deception.
After the consummation of many periods, they advanced in artful
attainments, and began to exchange thoughts with each other through
the medium of vocal, rudimental sounds, consisting of monosyllables.
At this age they were not acquainted with nouns, adjectives, and
verbs, and therefore their language displayed no distinct inflections.
It is well to observe the progress of their intellectual qualities, and
to notice the distinct results arising therefrom.  It is well known to
the nicely-critical observer of natural physiognomy, that thoughllts,
whether they arise from interior or external exciting causes, must of
necessity illuminate the eyes, the features, the whole countenance,
with the exact expression of their import.  Such was the mode of
expression among the first inhabitants of the earth during their unadulterated condition.  They expressed vividly and without suppression their interior thoughts upon their countenances, and thus. communicated with each other.
But when they had advanced a little further, and had partaken of
a little of the friuit of the tree of Knowledge, they began to conceal
their true sentiments, and to clothe them  with an arbitrary vocal
sound —which possessed not the power of communicating the real
reality of their ideas and affections to each other, but rather was
liable to convey deceptive impressions.
It is well to understand properly the origin and rudiments of vocal
language; but this we can not do without understanding the action
of sound upon the atmosphere, and its vibrations among the intricate
chambers of the ear.
The first inhabitants did not possess perfect vocal powers.  This
arose from a deformity of the trachea, larynx, and glottis.  These,
when perfectly arranged, act in concert to produce the variations of
sound, according to the influence of the will upon the parts.  If the
atmosphere had not been chemically so constituted, and composed
of particles of superior form and fineness to the particles of water.
sound would not have been known except as an indescribable sensa




## p. 331 (#359) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                331
tion.  This is established by the fact that the sound communicated
by the particles of water is very indistinct in comparison to that communicated by the atmosphere.  The particles of water are not so
perfect in form and refinement as the particles of the atmosphere.
Each of these elements has ascended above the angular and circular,
and holds an intermediate position between the spiral and vortical
forms —havino those forms that are adapted to the transmutation of
the lower and imperfect to the higher and more perfect forms.
The water, therefore, is a medium by which gross particles are
transferred into its own composition, by its attractive power as owing
to its spiral form.  And the atmosphere, being a higher degree of the
watery element, and having the vortical form, possesses a still greater
power of transferring the watery element into its composition. Thus
one is so arranged that it is adapted to the perfection of the other.
And these must be considered as owinlg their origin to the ruzdimcntal
forms.
By this knowledge of the constitution of the atmosphere may be
understood the phenomenon of vocal sound.  It is evident that when
the will excites the vocal organs, there is a communication of positive power constituted of more perfect particles than those previously
pervading the same organs.  And when the vocal organs are thus
excited, they become mediums for the descension of the will. This
produces a corresponding action upon the particles of the atmosphere;
and the first particles excited communicate their excitement to the
adjoining ones, and thus the action proceeds from  one particle to
another, each particle modifying the same, until it arrives at the labyrinth of the ear, where it becomes suitably modified to produce a
vibration among the chambers of that organ, and an impression is
thereby produced upon the mind of another.  Thus it was only by
the delicate modifications of sound, which is at first only an excitement, that such a orocess as vocal communication was ever discovered.
~ 72. The inhabitants of the earth thus came into possession of a
new power, only in consequence of the unfolding of their mental faculties.  The rudiments of vocal language are thus discovered. Their
sounds, consisting merely of monosyllables, were imperfect-not so
considered by themselves, but by subsequent nations which have
arranged the grammatical laws of language.
Language, therefore, is a result of progressive development; and

332            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
it existed in an imperfect condition ever since the development of
the law of Sensation. From that moment instinctive signs were employed by the animal creations; and these continued to grow more
and more perfect until the establishment and present condition of the
human inhabitants of the earth.  Vocal, verbal communication, could
not have occurred before this period: for previously the atmosphere
was too grossly constituted.
Not long after the introduction of verbal sounds as signs of impressions, the inhabitants became disunited in social affection in consequence of the misconceptions conveyed by those sounds. They
fnally could not enjoy each other's society; for every expression of
the mind, which was originally pure and unadulterated, was now
clothed in a false sheath; and this created disunity and confusion
imong all the inhabitants.
Previously to this, mankind were in an innocent and pure condition; but by the constant increase of these causes, they became disunited and repulsive to each other.  This has been distinguished in'he original history as a state of depravity.  It was in this manner
that their eyes were opened; and thus they were enabled to see their.wn deceptions and imperfections. And having a new power of
conversing with one another, they clothed their real and imperfect
thoughts by false sheaths or deceptive aprons of obscurity.
Thus the whole race became dejected and depraved: not because
they had violated any constitutional faculty, physical or mental, but
because their faculties were wrongly and imperfectly developed.
Such is the origin of all deception-of all imperfection.  From this
aoment misery and impure associations had their origin.  By coninued and ill-directed development of the faculties, vice and misery
increased.  The inhabitants acted more and more against each other's interests, and thus became disorganized and rendered entirely
wretched and unhappy.
At the period when this wretchedness prevailed most extensively,
they were obliged to leave the happy associations of their former
days, even the beautiful Eden of the earth, and became dispersed
into other lands.  Three distinct nations ultimately became established as flowing from this rudimental fountain. One of these settled
in the interior of Asia; another upon its eastern borders; and another
in the lower part of Africa.
The inhabitants of Asia, which were then divided into two nations,
consisting of the original and the branch, sustained a close relation to





## p. 333 (#361) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                333
each other and to the nation in Africa.  Indeed, they were all the
legitimate children of the original inhabitants.  But they were very
different in constitutions and dispositions, insomuch that they could
not harmonize consocially with each other.
There was existing in the minds of one nation a disposition to
peace, unity, and concert of action.  They dwelt harmoniously together; they were kind and gentle to each other and to their brother
nation, insomuch that they have been made to correspond to a slhepherd, and their amiable and gentle dispositions to the innocency of
sheep.
The opposite nation, which dwelt upon the borders of Asia, possessed the various dispositions of the primary inhabitants.  They
were imperfectly organized as to their mental, physical, and social
constitutions.  They manifested the passions of envy and retaliation.
They remained, to the same extent as were the previous inhabitants,
in a misdirected and ill-developed state.  From  this cause all manner of deception, tyranny, false ambition, and impure higlmindedness, arose among them. They were an imperfect and badly-organized nation.  They were deceptive and universally selfish; they were
haughty and uncongenial in all their social and intellectual bearings
and relations.  And there was such a disunity existing among them,
that they were compared by the primitive history to an unholy mlan,
termed Cain.
And the opposite branch of the same original inhabitants were, as
has been described, entirely dissimilar in all their natural and social
characteristics, and more perfect in their general constitutions. These
were, in the language of correspondence, compared to an amiable,
well-organized, and good man, named Abel.  Thus the two nations
were the legitimate children or branches of the same original germ;
and these were designated as Cain and Abel.
As these names have now become familiar, it can not be inappropriate to use them in designating the movements of these two nations.
Cain was very much versed in scientifics. He claimed, with an air
of self-sufficiency and false dignity, to possess the knowledge of all
things, and thus felt very much exalted above his brother Abel.
Abel was an unassuming, kind, and gentle being. He did not display the external, deceptive knowledges which characterized all of
his brother's actions.  He was a peaceful, good, and honest person,
having no highmindedness, but felt and sustained the principle of
justice and reciprocation throughout the various departments of his





## p. 334 (#362) ############################################


334            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
constitution. His whole form was beautiful and reflective of interior
beauty: for it manifested a general symmetry and a brilliant expression of interior principles, which rose far above the lofty pretensions
of his brother Cain, and showed that he associated with that which
was more pure and undefiled.
This peace and harmony dwelt within the bosom  of Abel; while
an air of pomposity and polluted selfishness was visible in the person
and actions of Cain.  Thus they dwelt together for a long period;
the one possessing a meek and amiable, and the other a presumptive
and domineering disposition.  And after dwelling together for the
period spoken of, Cain, as a selfish tyrant, possessing no pure, internal sympathy, rose with all his combined forces against his brother
Abel.  And the latter, being so meek, gentle, and submissive, yielded
without retaliation, and thus fell a sacrifice to a supercilious and selfexalted being —even his brother!
Thus the two nations warred together.  Devastation was the result: but soon the terrific combat was ended; and Cain, the overpowering nation, usurped the wide dominion of the whole earth!
This was the first stage of imperfect civilization.  It corresponds
precisely with the second and third orders of the animal creation.
The latter were gross and imperfectly formed, and they manifested
an impure, ferocious, and repulsive disposition.  They were in the
incipient stages of animal development, even as these two nations
were in the incipient stages of civilization: and they varied in innuinerable respects, even as the different nations of the earth have
subsequently varied.
~ 73. The nation (Cain) which superseded the other, was very
well versed in sensuous knowledge, and retained hereditarily all the
imperfections of the previous inhabitants.  Its people soon became
sensible of their defiled condition.  They became extremely depraved and wretched, such being the legitimate fruit of physical,
mental, and social violations.  They represented a being in despair,
suffering as they did the full consequences of their violations: and
thus Cain was represented as saying, "My punishment is greater
than I can bear."  This was an humble acknowledgment-a true
confession of depravity.
And it is thus seen that the unprogressed and incipient stages of
civilization erected a monumental demonstration of the inevitable
consequences of social and national violation.  This monument, in

deed, extends its turrets above the nineteenth century   And that
violations are always attended by corresponding consequences, is
evident in every department of Nature, whether organic or inorganic,.
animate or inanimate.  And thus the germ of civilization being imperfectly deposited, unfavorably situated, and imperfectly developed,
has turned the true faculties, true passions, and pure associations of
man, into unholy and polluted paths!
Here, then, is the origin and cause of all imperfection: and here
was the monument erected.  And the inhabitants of the earth, during
the many ages down to the nineteenth century, have not been able
to discover the cause of the existing imperfection, or to remove the
foundation of this fearful monument, and erect in its stead a temple
of universal peace, harmony, and reciprocation.  Is it possible that
the world still requires kind and yet positive admonition to guide and
direct them into the peaceful way of righteousness!
After the nation had thus conquered all that was good and amiable, it removed to another portion of the earth, which was further
west, and almost upon the European continent. Here they gradually became imperfectly and socially organized: and as it was a land
not fertile, it was termed " Nod;" for this corresponds to barrenness.
Here they gradually multiplied and became a great nation.  They
also improved as to their internal condition, informing themselves to
an extent upon natural and immutable principles.  But in consequence of their previous degraded condition, as they multiplied, their
hereditary deceitfulness also increased.  They thus formed an extcrnally-brilliant, tyrannical nation, possessing but few of the interior
qualities of mind in any high degree of development.
The garden of Eden literally corresponds to peace and beauty.
The streams of water that were described as flowillng through the
garden, were rivers the courses of which have since been changed by
the volcanic action of the earth.  These rivers correspond to fertility.
Adam and Eve correspond to two distinct nations-which ultimately
became associated, and thus formned one, in the interior of Asia.
The tree of knowledge corresponds to the undeveloped embryo of
perfection and intelligence.  The terms good and evil are used as
expressive of the legitimate fruits thereof: evil being the gross, imperfect, and undeveloped, and good being evil's perfection.  The
animal of the saurian species that is represented as being more subtle
than any other beast of the earth, corresponds to the secret, imper

ceptible progress of an unfavorable and unhappy mental development.
And eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge-of good and evil
-represents an experience of the fruits of the good, which at once
begets a knowledge of evil.   Thus it is that experience begets
knowledge: and if the inhabitants of the earth had not seen the
very lowest degrees of evil and wretchedness, the subsequent nations would not have known or appreciated that which stands in contradistinction.
The nations (which were two combined as one) thus obtained the
knowledge of good and evil; and this knowledge corresponds to having their eyes opened.  And becoming thus aware of their evil dispositions, they endeavored to conceal them  by making external garments: thus aprons correspond to a fearful secretiveness, and a dread
of having their corrupted characters openly manifested.  This, again,
corresponds to depravity: and thus they conversed deceitfully with
each other.
From this the nation, which had then lost their high degree of innocence and purity (merely because they were unfavorably situated,
insomuch that their situation became exceedingly evil and vitiating),
sank to a lower degree of uncivilization. From them sprang the two
nations designated in the primitive history as Cain and Abel-the
former being distinguished for external show and highmindedness,
and the latter being a meek and unsophisticated natign whose principles corresponded to the innocence of sheep.  The war and devastation that arose after many ages (after they had become men or
great nations) correspond to the predominance of ignorance and folly
over peace and goodness. The land of Nod corresponds to barrenness: and the multiplicity of the nation that sojourned in that portion
of the earth corresponds to the prevalence of universal artificiality
over all that is naturally pure and righteous.
We have now ascended to the basis of all theological speculations
of the nineteenth century, and of those that have called forth the energies of the most erudite men of every age and nation.  And many
speculators, in consequence of the unsearchable antiquity of the doctrines which they have investigated, have become entirely deceived
as to their origin and the foundation on which they rest.
It has already been revealed that in the constitution of mankind
there existed passions and principles which were in themelsves good.
But after the advance of the nations, they, by misconceiving the true

elements of their nature. created unfavorable circumstances, by which
the development of their passions and principles was entirely misguided; and consequently they became a degenerate and wretched race.
Here, then, is the cause of the present imperfection of the world.
Being misdirected in its incipient and rudimental stages, civilization
has gradually taken various courses, and these have been subjected
to many modifications,'until at the present period the disorganization
is so radical and universal that no inquirers have been able to search
out its foundation.  But we have seen that this consisted in the various conditions that were incidentally established among mankind
in consequence of the uncultivated state of their mental and moral
faculties, and of these being improperly directed.  From these causes
arose a universal misunderstanding, and an absolute disorganization
of that which would otherwise have been well sustained and controlled, and which also constituted the very essence undeveloped of
pure and undefiled morality.  Such, then, is the origon of evil; and
from its origin many dissimilar consequences have followed, varying
according to the civilized or uncivilized condition of the subsequent
nations.
~ 74. Africa at this time contained two distinct nations —one of
these being the original branch of the primitive inhabitants, and the
other being a part of the same nation, only disconnected by a dissimilarity of disposition and government.  And Asia contained three
distinct nations-the greatest of these being that existing in the interior, extending its dominion to Turkey; another being upon the
border of the continent; while the third existed in the region of Jerusalem.  These nations, which became thus disconnected, endeavored
to live apart firom  each other's interests, and thereby engendered in
their own communities a mutual hostility toward each other.  This
resulted in successive and destructive wars -not carried on by open:
combat with implements of destruction, but rather by devouring each
other by ingenious and fanatical despotisms.
It would not be proper to mention the descendant nations as dis-c
tinct from the primitive inhabitants: for in reality Afiica contained:
one general nation, as did also Asia after the settlement of the nation.
in the land of Nod.  These, however, divided into three distinct
branches, one of which located in a portion of the earth now knowni
as China, and some of these, again, settled in Central America.

They became disunited in proportion to the dissimilarity of their
dispositions, being from the first rendered variable by all the unfavorable conditions by which they were surrounded. Some of these nations (or rather parts of the first nation) advanced to some considerable degree of social and intellectual attainment-these, however,
being free from the imaginative conceptions which so greatly entered
into the minds of the succeeding nations.
They had not as yet erected any houses; for they dwelt in ingeniously-constructed tents made of the foliage that was so abundant
in those parts of the earth.  They had not as yet tilled the ground:
but they partook of such vegetable and animal forms as it was given
them  to know by instinctive consciousness were suited to sustain
their physical constitutions.
Many ages elapsed after this period before they arrived at a sufficient degree of intelligence to erect dwellings made from the very
large trees of those continents.  But there could be observed a steady
advancement in natural and social attainments; for it was now that
they began to arrange their vocal signs into an orderly and grammatical form.  Together with the improvement of language, the intellectual faculties became gradually unfolded; and they then conceived
the rudiments of the mechanic arts, and were soon able to make a
useful application of them.
Not long after this the nation that dwelt in Central America began;to improve rather more extensively than any of the older and kindred
nations.  Having ascended to a higher degree of intellectual development, they began to till the previously-uncultivated earth.  They
could see a natural adaptation of materials to the unfolding of interior principles, such as would redound to their united interests; and
they were guided partially by this conviction in all their artificial
and mechanical improvements.  Stones were soon discovered to be
useful materials for the building of more convenient and agreeable
dwellings.
They existed in this condition for a few centuries, during which
time there was a gradual unfolding of knowledge among them. And
ultimately there existed in Central America a beautifully-constructed
city, formed entirely according to the conceptions of beauty which
were peculiar to their then-uncultivated intellects.
The inhabitants of Asia and Africa remained in a degenerate conedition. Being so universally disunited in consequence of their imperfect social institutions, it became necessary, in order to control

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 339
the people, to establish over them an arbitrary government —to appoint a ruler who might exercise despotic, tyrannical dominion; and
the people were willing, as at the present day, to submit to these
unnatural and unholy governments.
These inhabitants began gradually to decrease in stature and
strength, according to the change of the elements surrounding them.
They were previously a large and athletic people, possessing powerful constitutions, and exercising unlimited control over all the lower
species in the animal kingdom.  BuRt they became at length a degenerate race in their physical as well as social organizations.
The inhabitants of the earth had not assumed a lighter color than
that which may be observed in the Jalofs and Caffers. The condition of their constitutions was owing to the slow unfolding of all their
essential qualities —which, if they had been properly directed, and
placed in the path of prosperity and development, would have rendered them (as the same would have rendered the world of mankind
at the present day) a brilliant and harmonious Brotherhood.
~ 75. The present degree of moral, social, and intellectual development, involves subjects of deep interest to the most profoundlyinquiring minds, among which class theologoians sustain a prominent
position. And inasmuch as their innumerable opinions are generally
the subsequent modifications of conceptions of the primitive and uncultivated inhabitants of the earth, they will feel a decided interest in
the following revealments as involving the truth or untruth of the main
features of their psychological theories.  For as we have now ascended to the origin of all mythology, of all heathenism, of all civilization, and truly-intellectual develop'nent, it becomes highly necessary that we should notice distinctly the origin of all important conceptions which have led the minds of the world, through successive
generations, into many unholy and imperfect opinions.
It is distinctly evident to the observing and inquiring mind that all
dissimilarity in opinions must in reality be owing to a difference in
the degrees in which different minds have become unfolded to the
reception of truth.  All minds are seemingly converging to one centre, at which will be developed the perfected knowledge of psychological and eternal truth.  This will be the establishment of some
vast, comprehensive, united system  of theology-one that will sustain an inseparable connexion with the natural, interior elements of
man, and with the universal laws of Nature, and likewise will unfold

340            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the consoling truths in reference to a future and interior world.  It
will be a theology perfected by the knowledge of scientific truths,
which are the rudiments of higher and greater truths, and by the
knowledge of the unperverted and unpolluted spiritual nature of man
as being the representative of the perfection characterizing tile universal creations.
In the subject before us, then, are centred the inquiries of theologians of the present day.  And the discovery of the source from
which all the various systems of theology have arisen, will prove that
the many paths heretofore travelled by theological speculators are
only so many degrees of mental development, each being determined
by the peculiar circumstances to the influence of which the minds of
men have been subjected.  And these paths are of themselves indistinct lines of truth in which the minds of all previous nations have
travelled; and through similar lines the minds of all subsequent nations must of necessity travel in order to arrive properly at the Fountain of true scientific and theological knowledge.
And there is no division between science, philosophy, metaphysics, and religion. For the first is the rudiment and basis of the
second. The second illustrates the first, and typifies tle third. The
third unites with the second, and flows spontaneously into the fourth.
The fourth pervades and comprehends them all, and flows as spontaneously to a still higher degree of knowledge and perfection.
Thus nothing is natural which is not moral.  Thus the natural
and the moral are conjoined principles dwelling in Nature and flowing out of truth.  All things, therefore, are good in themselves, but
consist of different degrees of goodness, and each is necessary to
make the whole an harmonious unity.
The metaphysician has entered into many profound investigations
relating to the mental constitution of man.  He has endeavored to
discover the origin of passions which constitute the elements of the
mind; the origin of Sensation (which is a principle of the organization originating in its inherent essence); and of the affections and
loves (which are the elements of all interior association); also of
Intelligence, which consists of the thoughts of the substance of the
mind. And in endeavoring to search out tile existing relations between these variously-modified elements, he has- arrived at various
and illegitimate conclusions. Not being able to discover the origin
of these things, or the nature of the spiritual composition, metaphysicians have reasoned entirely from an assumed basis, and their con

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 341
clusions have been in accordance with the basis on which they were
founded.  And so all the important theological inquiries at the present time are involved, as to the legitimacy of their results, in a proper
unfolding and truthful description of the imaginative imperfections
originating at this p'eriod of the world's history.
Some of the inhabitants of Asia had not improved to any extent
in their forms of vocal communication.  Their verbal language consisted merely of incoherent sounds made by the concussion of the
larynx and glottis; and these not being varied according to reason,
they became socially confused and ultimately divided into many
tribes.  These settled in the east of Asia, in the interior, and on the
borders joining the African continent.  They were in a very uncivilized condition, being governed generally by a sanguinary discipline
which expressed characteristics but little above the higher orders of
animals, and disconnected them completely from the nations in the
European continent and in Central America.
Here, then, is manifested all the disunity legitimately resulting
from a bad organization and imperfect situations-a disunity of feeling, of social interests, of intellectual attainment, and a destitution of
all those high and lofty principles that characterize a united and
happy brotherhood.
The inhabitants of Central America hiad advanced more than the
other nations in the arts, sciences, and mechanical inventions; but
their minds were yet uncultivated in all the higher branches of knowledge and refinement.  They had advanced also in language.  Every
century brought a distinct modification in their form of vocal communication: and they spoke a tongue so primitive that no analogy to
it has as yet been discovered in the elements of oriental and subsequent languages.  It possessed, however, some inflections, though
these were more imperfect than the same are in the speech of the
Sandwich-islanders.
The inhabitants of the European continent (which had multiplied
to a great nation) had not ascended to any important degree of refinement; for in every particular they were far below the condition
of the nation in Central America. And those in Africa were, if possible, in a lower degree of uncivilization than the African inhabitants
of the present day.  They were, however, above the brutish inhabitants that were divided into castes and tribes on the continent of
Asia.
At this period the inhabitants of the earth all lived without houses,

342            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
with the exception of the European and Central-American nations.
Vocal sounds were as dissimilar as their social and intellectual developments.  So the inhabitants were divided into every degree of
physical and mental disunity; and this is the basis of the disunity yet
existing among mankind —though the inhabitants of the earth are
now perceptibly converging to a higher degree of unity of interests.
About this period the imaginations of the more advanced nations
became very fertile, and were of a character corresponding with the
undeveloped state of their minds.  Imaginative belief began in this
period to form a conspicuous feature in the workings of the human
mind; and it is well to mention how these hallucinations became
established.
After the first inhabitants of the earth had discovered the process
of expressing thoughts by sounds, the confusion of understandings
soon became permanently established.  The land of Asia previously,
and indeed up to this time, presented a beautiful landscape of blooming fragrance, inasmuch as that geological portion of the earth had
advanced in rudimental compositions far beyond any other portions.
After this confusion of tongues, the inhabitants became disunited inll,
consequence of the deceptions practised upon each other-these
arising entirely from misconceptions of their interior relations toward
one another. Hence arose envy, cruelty, and misery, among them.
For they became jealous and envious of each other, and lost entirely
all the peaceful principles that previously united them instinctively
together.  These things arise from  a perversion or misdirection of
lie pure passions of man, and from an unfavorable development.
As a consequence of these social confusions, and of these adverse
feelings toward each other, they conceived of the existence of an imperceptible enemy which they supposed to be instilling into their
minds a spirit of vengeance and retaliation, and generating absolute
evil.  This belief prevailed among them to a great extent.  They
attributed the evil influence to the peculiar atmosphere that encompassed the earth, believing that the light which proceeded from the
sun possessed the pdwer of imparting to it these malignant influences.
And this fancy impressed their minds the deeper firom the fact that
they always abhorred each other when the sun apparently rose from
the depths below and shone upon them. Thus was engendered a
fear-to the existence of which the world at the present day can
bear witness.
In subsequent periods, after tile nations had become so hostile that

they warred against each other, the conquering ones, settling in the
west of Eden, possessed in a still more definite form the general
opinions of their ancestors. But these opinions now became modified in some particulars.  Yet all the inhabitants feared the sun, and
more especially the light emanating from it.  Thus arose a dread of
light —even of any interior or mental light, which might otherwise
have illuminated their minds and ameliorated their social condition.
It was concerning those who were still tinctured with this feeling that
the language was spoken which says, " Men love darkness rather
than light, because their deeds are evil."
Let it be understood that the inhabitants feared the literal light of
the sun.  The same fear, when modified, begat a fear of the sun
itself. And this corresponds to the fear of receiving too much mnental
light-though this light, if it had been properly received, would
have illuminated the interior principle of man, and made him a proper representative of the sphere which he is destined ultimately to
occupy.
The succeeding branches of this nation, which required many generations and centuries to be perfectly established, also modified materially the belief of their ancestors.
It is well to remark that this is the very basis of mythology: yet it
is too remote to be known to the world at the present day.
They now believed the sun to arise from an indescribable abyss,
of which it was the representative.  Clothed, as it was, with a robe
of consuming fire, and presenting to them such fearful declarations,
they shuddered at the contemplation of that which they supposed the
sun represented, which was inconceivably more fiery. Nothing excited such deep and general attention among the first inhabitants of
the earth as the sun-appearing, as it did, to rise perpendicularly
over the edge of the ground on which they existed, and watching
them with an iinmoveable and fiery eye for many hours, and then
sinking correspondingly on the opposite side.  They believed that it
had then lost all its fiery garments, and was returning to the fountain
of fire to be reclothed, to ascend again upon the opposite side. They
therefore believed in an inconceivable fountain of raging fire.  For
this they considered absolutely demonstrated by its representative,
the sun, which had been a dread to all previous generations.  This,
together with the opinions formerly entertained, constituted the faith
of the nation of Central America.
It is well to remark (and the remark can be applied to the prcsent

day) that a gross and imaginative hallucination, resulting only from
the disordered and confused state'of the mental faculties, becomes
modified in accordance with the development of intelligence. And
in proportion to the fertility of the conceptive powers, is the sublimity of superstitious imaginations.  Here, then, is an important point
for the consideration of the theological world.
I am distinctly impressed with the truthfulness of this account of
the original condition of the inhabitants of the earth. Thus language,
arts, sciences, consociality, and theological theories, advance in proportion to the advance of civilization.
~ 76. We are now approaching nearly to the period of which
records are contained in the primitive history of the earth and its inhabitants.  And before there was a decided change in the condition
of the world, there were several geological transformations and volcanic catastrophes, which altered the features of many portions of the
earth, and likewise changed the courses of many rivers and the positions of many seas.  And as this is the last that has occurred in the
geological history, and gave rise to what is by geologists termed the
alluvialformnation, it is well to mention the important occurrences of
this period.
The change was evidently necessary for tile requirements of the
subsequent inhabitants.  But in observing a phenomenon superficially, the mind does not recognise the order and harmony of the
workings of Nature's laws.  But even if the use of an occurrence
is not seen, it is not proper to question the wisdom of the cause
which produced it.  For the harmony of the whole grand plan
which unites in one Structure a Univerccelum of Universes, is only
seen and felt when viewed in its general aspect.  And however
plainly an occurrence may appear to us as the result of a dcfict in
any of the departments of the general plan, this does not prove that
it is so, nor is it in reality a sufficient basis on which to found any
theory.
Previous to the period under contemplation, the earth presented a
different geographical aspect from what it did after the consummation
of the volcanic occurrences referred to.  The north of England and
of America were then entirely submerged by water, as also were the
Australian regions.  A great portion of the waters of the Pacific
ocean, which divides the continent of America from Asia, then
formed the seas of the arctic regions, extending toward the south a

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                84~
narrow strip of water in the form of a river, which joined the gu.f
of Mexico and the Carribean sea.
Thus the inhabitants of Asia could, by following the circuit of
narrow strips of land, reach the portion of the earth now known as
Yucatan.  An isolated nation also extended along the connected
land into America.  And from  these originated the inferior inhabitants that have been found upon this continent, and known as the
American Indians, and which have excited so many queries as to
their origin.
Many of the islands in the southern and western portions of the
earth were at this time completely concealed by the sea which passes
between and divides the eastern and western hemispheres.  It is well
to remark that the Sandwich islands, the Friendly islands, and the
island of New Holland, are the three prominent ones that have since
become dry and fertile.
As was before stated, the condition of the atmosphere was such as
to constantly create and accumulate extensive icebergs, these existing principally in the northern and inundated portion of the earth.
These continued for many centuries after the previous submersions
which occurred at the close of the cretaceous and during the tertiary
period.  From the close of the tertiary period up to the present
time, there did not occur another and similar inundation.  For the
changes in the temperature were gradual, and the great mountains of
ice were as gradually melted as they were formed.  Thus the earth
was preserved fiom another and like universal submersion until the
present period, which is marked with more distinct and violent
manifestations than any of the previous catastrophes.
From the consummation of the cretaceous formation to the present
period, there have elapsed an incalculable number of ages —during
which time the animal kingdom has changed its main forms several
times, which changes were marked by a complete retiring of certain
orders of animals, and a formation of new and more perfect organizations.  These modifications occurred among the lower orders of
the animal creation, and from these there was a progress upward to
the production of the quadrumana; and from these, again, through
many ascending forms to the ushering-in of the lower bimana tribes;
and from these, again, up to the creation of man at the close of the
sixth day.
It is well to understand that one of these essential changes required
nearly a whole century —and that the changes were innumerable,





## p. 346 (#374) ############################################


346            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and therefore innumerable ages elapsed during the ascension of the
first forms of the fifth day to the organizations of the period under
immediate consideration.  It is therefore beyond the ordinary powers of computation to determine the exact number of years that
elapsed between the last submersion of the earth and the present
impending changes.
During this long period of time, the atmosphere and water became,
as in previous instances, unequal in density to the expansive force
of the igneous materials of the interior of the earth.  This is purely
an effect of the universal law of progressive ascension.  For the
water and atmosphere together constituted the fluid and gaseous envelope of the whole earth.  The action of one determines the action
and constitution of the other.  And if a change in these elements
occurs, it must be by the ascension of rudimental particles to enter
into ahigher form of combination.  The atmosphere at this period
had been modified by the modifications of the water-and this by
the changes experienced by the earth, and this by the modification
of its interior.  So it is well to understand that the interior, igneous
composition is balanced and counteracted, as to all its expansive and
eruptive forces, by the pressure of the water and atmosphere.  The
solid, external coating of the earth is the medium  by which the two
extreme compositions are sustained in a state of equilibrium.
This external pressure was diminished by the sublimation and recomposition of each element.  It was many ages before the whole
Mass entirely lost its equilibrium; and the present period is the point
of time when this inequality occurred.  The result was inevitable:
the mass in the interior soon became confused and universally disturbed.  The whole fiery ocean was in a state of inconceivable
agitation.  All the particles assumed impetuous motions, and rushed
to different parts of the great mass, being acted on by the expansive
heat of the interior composition.  This resulted in an unimiaginable expansion of the particles joining the crust of the earth.  The
result was the mighty catastrophe of which the whole earth now
bears evidence.  It was an upheaval of the entire upper portions
of England and America, with all the adjacent parts.  Volcanoes
that had before given vent to the expanding elements of the interior, were at this time rendered entirely useless; and the explosions
which followed shook the earth entirely to its centre, breaking in
some parts the whole combined strata, some of which sank and
others were raised to an immense height.  Thus geologists have no




## p. 347 (#375) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                347
ticed many prominences in which the upheaved strata seem upon
one side to have been abruptly broken, while upon the other side
they are gently inclined. These may be observed in the highlands
of Scotland and in the Grampian mountains; also in the upper portions of the European continent.
~ 77. The changes of the face of the earth at this time established
new positions for tile water, that before was in general a united body,
extending through many valleys streams that joined the same body
of water in other portions.  But the great change that occurred at
this time on both sides of the equator formed new islands, new lands,
and new bodies of water. At this time the Pacific ocean suddenly
flowed over the land that was before an extended valley, which, being
sunk lower, gave room for its admission; and since that time this
ocean has divided the two continents.  Also the Mediterranean and
Atlantic at that time became more confirmed in their present forms.
And firom that time unto the present period the earth has not changed
in its general aspect or geographical features.
The enormous icebergs that were existing in the northern portions
of the earth became at once dissolved by the evolution of heat at
those regions.  This resulted in a general inundation of all the low,
dry land of the earth, though the water did not ascend to the tops of
ordinary mountains.  The inhabitants that were upon the continents
before described were partially destroyed.  The inhabitants of Europe, as settled according to the previous descriptions, were almost
entirely destroyed.  The inhabitants of Asia and Africa were generally undisturbed, although in some parts, as for instance where now
exists the Caspian sea, there dwelt a multitude which were swallowed
up by the great convulsion; also a small nation upon the mouth of
the Ganges, and another toward its upper extremity.  This river did
not exist to any great extent until some portions near its then-existing
borders sank with their inhabitants; and thus the river was formed in
its present condition.
The inhabitants of Yucatan, which then extended to the gulf of
Mexico, were likewise partially destroyed; for the gulf and the Carribean sea were formed by the sinking of inhabited portions; while
those that dwelt entirely in Yucatan were undisturbed.  About one
half of the inhabitants of Asia and Africa were buried in the interior
of the earth.
Thus about two thirds of the inhabitants of the earth were de




## p. 348 (#376) ############################################


348            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
stroyed by the great earthquake and inundation.  A few remained in
Asia, and more in Africa; and these, with those that inhabited Yucatan, were the only inhabitants remaining upon the earth, with the
exception of three isolated tribes in North America.
This occurrence produced a change in every department of animate and inanimate Nature.  The water and atmosphere became
now  permanently established, composed of the same elements in
nearly the same proportions as constitute them at the present day.
The atmosphere being an ultimate of the water, and pervading it,
became a useful agent to transfer the same into its own composition,
and by means of the same operation the earth is refreshed by rain.
And by virtue of light derived from particles constituting the atmosphere of the sun, the atmosphere of the earth is rendered congenial
to all living forms; and by the same means the water is also rendered
suitable to sustain and nourish its living inhabitants.  And by virtue
of the united whole, the earth is rendered fertile and blooming.
So the atmosphere and water became so constituted as to balance
the expansive force of the interior substance.  And so the earth has
remained in a stable condition ever since the period of the universal
change.
Many forms in the vegetable kingdom were destroyed; but their
places were soon supplied by kindred and more perfect forms. But
it is not necessary to enter into any particular description concerning
the conditions of the vegetable and animal kingdoms: but attention
is directed to the condition of the inhabitants of the earth.  This period is represented as the cleansing of the earth of all its impure and
unrighteous forms.  The flood, however, is described in the primitive history as rather more universal than it actually was.  It is
termed a flood, and is represented as a universal one-which corresponded to an entire geological and geographical change of many portions of the earth, together with the utter destruction of many inhabitants that were very unhappily situated and very imperfectly developed.
The inhabitants that are represented as being saved were those
that dwelt in the land of Yucatan.  For the others were generally
destroyed, but few remaining in comparison to the vast population of
both continents.
The original description of the flood is, however, an entire spiritual correspondence-representing in an imperfect manner this great
catastrophe, which was the basis of the whole illustration.  The exact correspondence will be discovered and related hereafter: but it is





## p. 349 (#377) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 349
well to mention that it was by this volcanic occurrence and this great
inundation that the correspondence was suggested, having an internal
meaning; for it is impossible for the account to have a literal signification. And as this portion of the history of the earth does not sustain a close relation to the meaning of the language in the primitive
history, it is not necessary that I should at this time reconcile the
apparent discrepancy between the original and the present description. I am impressed that the internal meaning of many sayings that
were apparently literal has not as yet been properly and generally
understood by mankind, notwithstanding their true meaning was understood by those who wrote them, and has since been unfolded to
the world by an expanded and suitable intellect.
The inhabitants of Yucatan were far more advanced in the arts,
sciences, and general intellectual attainments, than any other nations
upon the earth.  This land was not the first inhabited, but was
peopled by a branch nation that came from Asia.  Those that existed
in Asia were yet in an uncultivated and uncivilized state.  So likewise were those in Africa.  Those that dwelt in North America
were also very uncultivated as to their physical, mental, and social
condition, being the ancestors of the subsequent Indians.  These
were at this period the only inhabitants of the earth.  And from this
period it is well to date the early history of the human race-considering all the previous inhabitants as only in the incipient stages of
this condition of mankind, which condition represents all the subsequent conditions of the race throughout the whole earth.
~ 78. Soon after this period, as will be discovered, the nations began to conceive of substantial signs as representatives and correspondences of things and thoughts.  These are the hieroglyphlics; and
from these the subsequent historians derived their knowledge and
impressions.  There is no real knowledge to be obtained fiom hieroglyphics or history concerning the earth or its inhabitants antecedent to this period.  And theological and mythological impressions
had their origin nearly as far back as this period, at which the inhabitants of the earth at the 1)resent day date their origin.
And at this period the history of language begins; and fiotn this
it may be traced through the various and successive nations to its
present condition.  So this is a period in the earth's history marked
by more important considerations than almost any other period: for
we have now ascended to the basis of all subsequent conditions of

the world down to the present day. And it is within this period that
man has become so far perfected as he now is in all his powers and
faculties, and has acquired the ability to understand the important
truths developed in the gradual progress of every nation, and by
which he can understand the more interior truths that have, up to
the nineteenth century, remained entirely concealed from the human
mind.
And it will be a universal relief to mankind from  their present
misconceptions, to understand the important truths concerning the
interior and ultimate life.  It will then be discovered that our ideas
do not flow from the external to the internal, but rather flow spontaneously from the interior through the organization into the external
world, there to perceive and reason upon the stupendous workings
of Nature, rendered prolific, beautiful, and congenial, by the reflux
of interior principles.  Then our conceptions will be from the interior, and not created, as all conceptions have been supposed to be,
by the intrusion of external things.  For let this idea be as universal
as it is true, That thoughts are not generated by external things, but
that they are evolved from the living principle within.  And thus it
will be made plain to the reasoning faculties of man that all external
forms, from the smallest insect to man, to Nature, to the Solar System, to the Univercmlum, are merely images shadowing forth the
interior and creative causes-the essential principles, the divine
Mind -and that all forms are merely receptacles of the living, active
principles that generate within them Motion, Life, Sensation, and Intelr
ligence.  For as the vegetable kingdom receives nourishment from the
light and heat emanating fiom the sun, so does the animal kingdom, including man, receive spiritual light and life from the Light which is
the Love of the divine Mind, directed by Wisdom: and so Love is
the Life, and Wisdom is the Organizer.
When we conceive of an organization, we are at once impressed
with the existence of parts and qualities necessary to constitute such
properly.  The whole is composed of parts, and the parts are necessary to the whole; yet these do not of themselves constitute a perfect
organization. For an arch may be composed of an indefinite number of stones, without which the arch could not exist; but suppose
the arch to be disorganized, this would not alter the fact that the
stones are the parts, and remain in substance unchanged.  In order,
therefore, to form a perfect organization, it is not only necessary to
have every part adapted to the whole, and each part to perform a use

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               351
and fulfil a purpose, indicating a final cause, but it is necessary that
these parts should have life and motion, and enter into mutual relations with each other, and thus form a whole or combined unity, in
which a use must be manifest. And the use accomplished is the end
of the organization.
The organization of man is of itself perfect.  In every department
there is an equal adaptation —an endless amount of uses —which
converge to as many ends; and these when conjoined display one
perfect'Use and End for which the whole was created.
Thus man is existing. He is composed of an infinite number of
parts; he is a microcosm; he is a united Whole.  He could not be
so if there were not a use in the plan, or if there were not an end to
be accomplished. He is therefore rendered a proper receptable of
the spontaneous breathings of the Great Positive Mind, through Nature, by Wisdom, to form and individualize the immortal spirit to
dwell in the world within.
Thus man is an organization, not composed of a mutual agreement
of parts through the indefinite workings of an impetuous Nature, but
is rather the perfect form, the highest image, the designed organization, of the divine Mind that pervades immensity!
~ 79. It now becomes necessary that I should dismiss all refections concerning the use and end of the human organization, and
confine my descriptions to that which flows legitimately out of the
perfected physical conditions of this era. I am at present to say
nothing concerning the moral and intellectual developments of the
human race, nor concerning the conception of theological opinions
and the gradual confirmation of them in the minds of mankind, nor
concerning the modifications of these opinions by each nation through
subsequent periods, until the identity of the original conceptions was
lost. Matters referring to the general deluge, and to other general
occurrences, will now be dismissed from  notice until a notice of
them comes in as a consequence of their theological originations.
But the object of the following descriptions will be to present to view
the stream of mankind, from its origin, through its many circuitous
courses, until each nation, as a branch of the original stream, has
contributed to establish the general condition of the world in the
nineteenth century.  I commence, then, at the birthplace of the
lowest types of mankind, and trace them  through their various de

velopments, until they form what may be termed a perfect Man of
the present period.
Asia, as all mythological traditions truly indicate, cradled the first
born of the human species, and nourished them from the lowest
stages of infant innocence to the period of the extension of their powers and faculties, and until the change of their local habitations to various other portions of the earth.  To describe these developments and
changes in a connected way, from the time the animal assumed the
form of the human at a period before mentioned, it will be necessary
to commence at the first evolving from one germ of the forms and
properties of a subsequently-distributed race.
In the beginning, there was existing in the interior of eastern Asia
an association composed of the first human beings who dwelt upon
the face of the earth. On a parallel with this family was subsequently
located another one of similar type, but of a weaker and more effeminate nature; and they were not so large in stature, or so numerous,
as were tile former.  These gradually became acquainted with each
other by following out the inclinations of their constitution, which led
them to seek association one with another.
1 am impressed with the reason wihy two families were thus congregated in different places, at first without the knowledge of each
other's existence.  It will appear from research respecting the mammiferous species approaching to man, that there were originally two
distinct moulds or forms of these, ascending at the same time nearly
to the human type of organization.  One had existed in the arctic
regions, and in the upper portions of Asia, ever since the great revolution in the types of the animal kingdom at the close of the fifth day
of creation.  From that period these gradually ascended to the human type which characterized those who were existing in the interior
of eastern Asia.  By a corresponding modification, the mammiferae
that were existing in the interior portion of western Asia ascended to
the effeminate type previously described.  These located in western
Asia, and the former in eastern Asia.
But they did not discover each other's locality until they had by
industry accumulated social wealth in abundance.  The ease which
then occurred in their social condition gave to the elder members of
each family a desire to discover new and more congenial portions of
the land upon which they lived.  And I am  distinctly impressed
that it was this undeveloped and effeminate race that originally discovered the location of the older and more matured inhabitants of

NA[TURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               363
the interior of eastern Asia.  The period of time that elapsed is pre
sented to me indefinitely: but it was not more than one century and
a half from the time that they became individually located before
they became conjoined one with another. Then the two formed one
family.
During the lapse of another century, two branches sprang from
this family and flowed, the one into the lower portion of Asia now
known as Egypt, and the other into the interior of Africa.  In fifty
years from this period, these offshoots grew into large families, and
one of them  ultimately grew into a powerful nation.  Those that
were in Egypt, however, sprang from the rather more matured stock
of the primitive family, and thus retained all the peculiar characteristics of their gross constitutions, which were powerfully energetic, and
the strength of which was determined by the great development of
muscular fibres and solids in their physical systems.  They also
possessed great nervous power, which was sustained by a strict adherence to ihe requirements of their bodies and an abstinence from
organic violation; from which cause also they were undiseased. But
they were unlike those that settled in Africa, and who continued to
possess all the imperfect and delicate characteristics of the more undeveloped portions of the original family.
And about this period (that is, about one half a century fiom they
time they became permanently located) the inhabitants that dwelt in,.
Egypt rose against the other nation, in Africa, with all the vengeance
of infuriated brutality, and warred with them until they destroyed:
nearly three fourths of their number, and dispersed the remaining'
few to various portions of the same continent.  This battle is represented almost perfectly by the battle which was spoken of as being
nearly consummated on the planet Mercury: for they fought with
the same kind of implements (that is, sharply-hewvn stones), and man —
ifested all the ferocious dispositions which are displayed by sonme
classes of animals, but which are modified and rendered a little moreperfect in man.  And these were at this time displayed with all the
ingenuity of which their mental faculties were capable, and with all
the force of their powerful physical constitutions.  Those that became.
scattered upon the continent of Africa I lose all trace of, because they
evidently became extinct.
~ 80. Now, again, are only two nations existing upondthe face of
the earth-the one in Egypt and the other in. eastern Aisia.  M-fy

impression now leads me.to a period one century in advance of this
period. And now the nation which dwelt in Egypt became located
upon the southern portion of Europe.  At this period they had advanced so far in civilized life that they constructed, in a most eccentric form, a beautiful city.  They did not employ stones, but rather
trees, which they arranged one above another against huge trees already matured.  The tops of these they broke or bent to each other,
and then thatched them in a singular manner; and thus they formed
the roofs of their dwellings.  In this manner did they construct residences of sufficient number to contain every person belonging to
their nation; and this I am impressed was the first conception of architecture in the uncultivated minds of the original inhabitants.
At this period Europe yielded a low type of the oats and rye,
whlich, however, may not be termed such, as it bore no resemblance
to the present forms of those grains.  But I use these terms mlerely
in order to convey to the mind the article of food which was at that
time yielded upon many portions of the European continent.
This nation increased in numbers excessively, and finally grew
Into such a mass of uncultivated intellects, that, being unguided, and
incapable of directing themselves, they became disunited.  And in
nearly one century more from  this period, branches of this same
people established in Central and South America two still more
treautiful cities.
Meanwhile those that dwelt in Asia set about another voyage of
discovery: at which time the Pacific ocean was unformed, which fact
Tendered it possible for them to pass from the eastern to the western
hemisphere, or to gain safely the upper portions of America.  It has,
however, been supposed that the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent must have crossed Behring's straits: but this hypothesis requires
no direct refutation, as it is evident that those who suggested it did
this in endeavoring to conceive of the possibility of the migration of
this people.
But I will proceed to notice the inhabitants of the southern portion,of this western hemisphere, as it at this time contained an advanced'nation of the original family.  The portions upon which the whole
nation, dividing into various branches, became located, are now
known as Spain and Yucatan, extending their more minute branch-,es to the portion now occupied by the gulf of Mexico, and also
ito Brazil and Buenos Ayres. They constructed here, according to
tthe previous description, their cities of stone and other durable ma

terials, building very low and extensive dwellings, with apartments
similar to those which are constructed for habitations at the presen'
(lay.  They had not as yet attained to the conceptions of architecture
which were possessed by the inhabitants of those portions after the
lapse of five centuries, during which time portions of South America
suffered much from volcanic catastrophes, which formed the Mexican
gulf Caribbean sea, and Pacific ocean. During these appalling occurrences, nation after nation was destroyed; and there was a depopulation of almost every portion of these regions.  But fiom the
time of which I have spoken as the commencement of the existence
of these cities, down to the fifth century afterward, the inhabitants
became very much advanced in external information, scientific attainment, and hieroglyphical architecture.
At this time became founded the cities of Herculaneum,* Yucatan,
and a primary city near the site of Pompeii.  But as details concerning the social and physical conditions of these inhabitants would be
unimportant in respect to the ohbject of my present impressions, I will
say in reference to them at the present time no more-but will pursue the general subject as before marked out, noticing the upbuilding, flourishing, and advancement, of each nation, city, and kingdom,
together with the subsequent downfall thereof.  So, then, I proceed
to the period of the upbuildingr of the city of Pompeii, and to the
permanent establishment of five nations that arose upon the face of
the earth about this period.
The inhabitants of Yucatan extended their rights of possession almost to the islands now known as the West Indies, a portion of the
same nation being established in Herculaneum. And Pompeii peopled various portions existing southeast and north of this city, and
sent fdrth a branch which peopled Brazil, extending to its extreme
boundaries.  But Pompeii as a great city, and her inhabitants as a
great nation, yielded all their beauty, grandeur, and magnificence —
ignorance, pride, and arrogance-to the annihilating hand of volcanic
action.  And by such agency she and her possessions were buried
-the tops of the highest dwvellings being covered to the thickness
of many feet by the contents of a bursting crater.  I call this Pompeii
far the sake of distinction; but in reality a city that was subsequently
founded near the same spot assumed for the first time the name of
* The speaker directs me here to say that these modern names of cities and territories are used simply to designate localities, and for the sake of distinction; but that
no places of those names existed at the time spoken of.

356            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Pompeii. And the city of which I speak can only be known to have
existed by discoveries of some of its still-existing materials, which
may be made by seeking at a place a little north of the city that has
subsequently been destroyed in a similar manner. But I have not
yet arrived at the period of the city known as Pompeii to mankind
of'the nineteenth century.
But I come now to speak of various other portions that were similarly depopulated, and also of Yucatan.  And it was in this portion
of the world that the greatest ingenuity and refinement existed in the
art of architecture and in various other ornamental and hieroglyphical
arts that ever existed, either before the founding of these cities, or
since that period.  Let it be distinctly understood, however, that
these vast conceptions and attainments continued to flourish in an
equal manner for nearly seven centuries.
I will now advance one more century, and describe new branches
of the human family-inhabitants that passed from  Asia toward
America-some of which reached this continent, and others of which
settled upon intermediate fertile portions which were suited to their
fancy and inclinations.  And I am distinctly impressed that while
they were thus forming families and associated nations on these portions, the Pacific ocean became established in its present form, forming the islands known as the Philippine islands, Society islands,
Sandwich islands, &c.  And the population of these islands, thus
surrounded by a body of water impassable by any means of navigation which they then possessed, were unable to change their habitation. But happily these portions were fertile, and yielded produce
suitable to sustain their existence. And these very inhabitants gradually became modified into those at present existing upon these islands, and whose character and dispositions will be understood by
perusing the pages of modern geography.
Those that remained upon the continent of Europe settled at this
time in some portions of northern France.  And those that remained
in Asia had, as I have described, begun distributing themselves to
other portions of the earth; and a type of them is slightly visible in
the aboriginal inhabitants of America, and also of the Sandwich and
Philippine islands. And at the consummation of the period which
I have last mentioned, a distinguished and powerful tribe, detaching
themselves from the southern nations, proceeded along the European
continent, along Africa and Asia, and settled precisely where Dre

viously existed the Indo-Europeans, and on the portion that has been
modernly termed Egypt.
~ S1. I now pass to the close of another century. And this century is characterized more distinctly by the rapid advancement of
civilization and intelligence. Egypt became founded, settled, and
confirmed, as it was known to subsequent historians. From Egypt a
branch or tribe sprang which settled Jerusalem  and Jericho; and
from these and Egypt sprang a colony which discovered Greece and
founded and upbuilt a city. From Greece other portions of Europe
were permanently peopled.
Thus after Egypt became settled, Jericho and Jerusalem  were
founded, together with Greece and other nations, all of which sprang
entirely from the original settlers of Egypt.  From  other parts of
Europe flowed a stream into the portion now known as Spain; and
thus Spain was re-inhabited.
At the close of the previous century, hieroglyphics became sufficiently perfect to shadow forth intelligibly the thing, substance, or
thought, which the inhabitants desired to represent: and it was not
before the close of the last century and the introduction of the present, that the records commenced from which the world has received
any correct or definite information concerning the primitive inhabitants of the earth and their early history. I find it impossible, according to my present correct impressions, to discover, by examining
all written records of every age and generation, even one single intimation of the true condition of the inhabitants of the earth, of their
social advancements and intellectual attainments, or of any of their
early history, extending further into the recesses of primitive ages
than the close of the last century, or the period of the permanent establishment of various cities in the eastern hemisphere.  Still I discover an unbroken connexion between the actual previous conditions
and those of which we are informed by hieroglyphical and nytholooical tradition.
So, then, at the close of the century of which I have last spoken,
we find the earth inhabited in this manner: An uncultivated and uncivilized tribe existed upon the western or American continent; two
large and flourishing cities existed in the southern portion of the same
continent, or in Central and South America, their dependencies comprehending the West Indies, upon which islands a few tribes are
existing; also Spain and Portugal were inhabited by a small tribe

proceeding fiom  the Grecians of the European continent;- north
France and Britain sustained a small, detached nation from the Grecians; and Greece, Jerusalem and Jericho, and Egypt, were inhabited as before stated; and China, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Prussia,
Russia, Norway, and Siberia, each sustained detached communities
from various portions of the earth.  These various countries, cities,
kingdoms, and empires, which I have designated by their modern
names, were in this way, one after another, discovered, founded, and
settled, by the various and heterogeneous tribes that were then existing upon the face of the earth.
It was owing to the dissimilarity of constitutions as adapted to climate and food, to the difference in their habits and modes of life, to
the difference in their degrees of advancement in science and architecture, to their different degrees and kinds of ambition, and to the
general superficial development of their qualities, that the inhabitants
of the whole earth became thus distributed.  And thus the -whole
race at this time was much diversified in appearance and constitution.
And they have subsequently been classified and reclassified, according
to each modification of the original type: and at the present time, even
the antiquarian and philologist who has searched most deeply into all the
palaetiological sciences, is, as I am distinctly impressed, unable to form a
correct conclusion respecting the earth's history previous to the period last contemplated.  But some have made powerful exertions to
reconcile supposed previous conditions with the a priori hypothesis
that each of these species must of necessity have had an exclisive
original type, of which those that are existing are the unchanged
representatives.
But as this is the period when commenced the first historical records concerning the early state of the earth and its inhabitants, I am
impressed to speak more particularly concerning all subsequent conditions, circumstances, and developments, that flowed out of the
conditions of this period and characterized the human race through
all subsequent ages down to the nineteenth century.  Yet I am
not directed to recapitulate that already known to the world, but
merely to present that which is not correctly obtained from oriental
tradition, and to classify distinctly the human species so that we may
properly conceive of the origin of language.  And when we correctly conceive of the origin of language, an understanding of the
origin of theological conceptions will legitimately flow out therefro 1m

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               359
The traditional records of the primitive nations of Asia are among
the first historical accounts we have of the original nations.  And it
is known that China possesses a record of the world which extends
forty thousand years back of the nineteenth century.  And various
parts of Asia bear evidence of the long and steady development of
science and civilization, although other portions indicate the most
uncultivated and barbarous conditions of the human race.  But reliable historical information as concerning the arts and refinements
of the primitive nationm, and their mechanical and architectural knowledge, extends no further back than the peopling of Egypt.  But the
marks of distribution and civilization since then are distinctly discoverable in the historical records of each nation, from the period under
review down to the nineteenth century-though these appear in a
connected form among some nations, and among others they are entirely traditional, indefinite, and mythological.
But it was given me to know that South America and Mexico
were inhabited many centuries before Spain became inhabited as
known to historians.  And these southern inhabitants highly cultivated the powers of mechanical construction; and these acquirements were retained by subsequent generations, when a branch of
the inhabitants migrated to Egypt, and there became a large and advanced nation.  Then from Egypt sprang Greece; and from Greece
many portions of Europe were settled; and from these, again, Rome,
and also other cities within its once vast and extensive empire, became founded and inhabited.  And the settlers of Rome continued
to flourish in all the mechanical and architectural attainments, as did
the ancients of Greece; but they left uncultivated all those high
and lofty faculities from which arise the most sublime and truthful
thoughts and sentiments, and which, if properly applied, would
have redeemed the race from the then despotic dominions of external
artificiality.
In this manner, the various portions of the European continent of
which we have spoken became inhabited and settled.
~ S2. It is unnecessary to mention the devastating wars, famines,
and pestilences, and the desolating invasions by deception, fraud, and
stratagem, that ultimately came upon each nation throughout the eastern hemisphere, arising from the uncultivated and barbarous dispositions which characterized the people of each nation, and which elevated the potentate of eaclh to the lighest degree of arrogance and

-360           NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
selfishness. And a false direction, and an unnatural envy which
sank deep into the bosom of each nation, poisoned the tender affections of each to the highest possible degree, and diffused among them
hatred and wretchedness.  And thus wars innumerable pervaded the
eastern kingdoms-all resulting from the misdirection of human
thought and jndgment.  The result of these peace-destroying, desolating wars was, that the nations that were compelled to yield became
dispersed among other nations, and thus the identity of many tribes,
and even types, of the human species, have become entirely destroyed.
Some of these invasions and persecutions continued for nearly a
century, during which time nightly incursions were made upon each
other, in accordance with their usual mode of warfare. And during
these wars many cities that displayed beauty and grandeur, owing to
the high cultivation of the fine arts and mechanical inventions, were
destroyed. Not only have cities been thus swept firom the face of
the earth, but whole nations have fallen a sacrifice to overpowering
nations.  And somrewhlat in the same manner were these wars continued for a long time.
But there was a period when the nations became settled into a
more harmonious and united condition, which for a time quieted the
unnatural dispositions to war, and breathed general sympathy, peace,
and reciprocation.  But soon after this period, nation after nation
again became involved in war, some of which were successful, and
others were nearly banished from the earth.
There is an event now presented for description which will illustrate the character of those impetuous wars.  After J.udea had become peopled, the inhabitants, not possessing judgment sufficient to
govern themselves, chose a presuming chieftain as their head, and
placed him in their city to exert power and influence over the whole
nation.  After this chieftain had warred with parts of his own kingdomi, and incited hostility and bloodshed in many before-undisturbed
portions thereof, lie died.  And so likewise Saul ascended the throne
of Judea; and he assumed the character of a tyrannical king, and
warred with the Jebusites in Palestine, which, after being dispersed,
became mingled with other nations.  And ultimately David usurped
the throne, and changed the seat of government to Jerusalem, which
had at this time grown into a beautiful and magnificent city.  Here
lie, assisted by others, warred with the Syrians, Chaldeans, Armalekites, Edomites, Ammonites, and Persians, and succeeded in destroying

die identity of,me of these nations, and of those tribes that were
existing along the borders of the Euphrates, and soon extended his
kingdom from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, and friom the
Phoenician territory to the Arabian gulf.  This, then, is an example
of the results of misdirected human judgment, characterized as it
is by all the features of tyranny, arrogance, despotism, andl enthlusiasm.
And when the people of England were governed by King Alfied
the Great, the Danes or Normans rose against the Saxons with feelings of bitterness and persecuting hostility.  And they succeeded in
overpowering the Saxons, and held for a time the dominion over
them.  But Alfred, being in possession of a more cultivated judgment as well as a higher sense of honor and justice, invented means to
regain his kingdom by dispersing the Normans who then had possession.  In this undertaking he was eminently successful, insomuch
that he gained power over the Danes or Normans, and they were
compelled to sue for deliverance.  For a knowledge of this occurrence peruse the early history of the Saxons.
I am impressed to describe these dissimilar events in order to
show the great difference between the inhabitants of early periods
and those of the present day.  The Saxons, when they were invaded,
did not possess the art and implements of war in so high a state of
perfection as did the Israelites when they fought against and subdued
those neighboring nations.  So a difference is manifest between the
uncultivated and unnatural passions of primitive nations and the more
advanced but still more corrupted passions which characterize the
nations of subsequent periods.
A large portion of Asia has at different periods been in the possession of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Persians, Mongols, Syrians, Tartars, and Turks. And so Asia, and likewise other portions of the
earth, have been at different periods subject to the struggles and wars
of successive nations for the ascendency over each other, and to the
outbreaks of all the unnatural and unholy passions excited by these
wars; and the whole resulted entirely from the misdirection of the
minds of the youthful generations.  Thus various changes have occurred in the social and moral conditions of the early inhabitants of
our earth.  And they have changed and rechanged local habitations
until the eastern hemisphere has become peopled as it is known to
be at this present period.

8~ 3. I am now directed to speak concerning the western hemisphere, or the portion of the earth that was unknown to any of the;nhabitants of the world a few centuries ago, except to those who
dwelt upon it fiom  the time they immigrated from the interior of
Asia.  This portion of the earth was in early periods fertile in many
of the lower types of the vegetable kingdom, and gave birth in its
northern and southern regions to many huge and ferocious forms of
the animal kingdom, and some of which also traversed the forests of
the interior of the continent.  I am not impressed with the number
of inhabitants that dwelt upon this land, but it appears distinctly
clear that there were three tribes, occupying different portions of the
land. All of these, however, preserved the general type and characteristics of the original inhabitants, who, as it is given me to know,
crossed from Asia into America about the period that a tribe descended into the southern portions.  This appears to have been
about nine thousand years antecedent to this day.
And thus they lived (laving, soon after they became settled, been
divided from the rest of the inhabitants of the earth by the submersion of the land or forming of the Pacific ocean), cultivating such
vegetable forms as have since been termed rye and corn.  And other
kinds of fruit, which have since been named, formed also a part of
their food.  They multiplied and formed three distinct tribes or seminations, in about one century and a half.
Subsequently, tribe after tribe was formed; and each possessing
the same constitutional desire for discovery, would travel to various
portions of the hemisphere.  But being disunited from the nations
that were civilized and enlightened in the intricacies of the arts and
sciences, they retained all the grossness of their unadvanced progenitors, with the exception of the slight improvement resulting from the
gradual experience which each tribe and generation accumulated from
the conditions and circumstances to which it was subjected, and from
the limited manifestations of natural genius which occasionally occurred among them.
And thus they dwelt, encouraging the spontaneous conceptions of
a more truthful theology than existed among any other of the nations
of the earth-deriving the same fiom the imposing grandeur, loveliness, beauty, and majesty, of all things in Nature, and from the rnagnificent stellar architecture under which they lived, and upon which
they could gaze with wonder, awe, and adoration. I am impressed
that they came nearer to a truthful conception concerning the higher

spheres than the inhabitants of any other portion of the earth, in that
or any other age or generation.  But as this subject is connected
with our theological researches, it is not proper to reveal more on it
at present.
Thus did the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent exist for many
centuries, advancing very imperceptibly in any of the natural and superficial attainments of other nations.  And thus were they existing
when this portion of the earth was discovered and settled by a colony
which came from the north of Europe.  After this timne, the population of European origin increased rapidly; and as they increased in
numnbers and power, the original inhabitants fled from their presence.
They felt that those who came from Europe were of a nature and
disposition antagonistic and repulsive to them; and thus at first they
were afraid.  But on becoming more habituated to the customs and
manners of the colonists, they became settled, and admnired their
goods, but retained the same repulsive awe on comning into their
presence.
But the European inhabitants, soon discovering that they could, by
exercising their superior force and skill, obtain the crops and stores of
food within their possession, rose up against the Indians and dispersed
them to other portions of the land.  This incited for the first time
within their breasts, the feeling of hostility, vengeance, and retaliation;
and this impelled them to indefatigable perseverance in bloodshed
and invasion.  Many tribes thereby lost their identity.  Thus the
aboriginal and European inhabitants were hostile to each other.
At a subsequent period, the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere
immigrated to this portion of the earth in abundance, and thus founded and established cities displaying a high degree of all the arts and
sciences, which the inhabitants had fortunately imbibed firom early
impression and cultivation.  By these means tile people were enabled to accumulate wealth, and to render their condition far superior
in a social- point of view to that of the rude inhabitants which preceded them; and these advantages flowed from a high degree of just
action, of proper judgment, of economy, industry, and magnanimity.
But in proportion to the blessings which flowed firom  the much
happier conditions and circumstances in which the inhabitants of this
land were placed, did the passion of envy and jealousy inspire the
nation from which they sprang.  They could not rest tranquil in
view of the great contrast between despotic and liberal government.
And by the feelings thus created, they were incited to demand a

surrender of the rights of this people, and to seek to neutralize their
then-existing privileges by depositing in their midst the germ of tyranny and usurpation, and thus to subject the whole nation to pain,
poverty, wretchedness, and despotic bondage.
But the latter people had increased to a great nation, though this
was small in comparison to that from which they sprang. However,
their facilities and natural advantages transcended entirely those of
the nation that came against themn; and being impelled by the inspiring thought of freedom, they fought against the unjust invasion
of their own parent-country, and gained triumphantly the victory over
potential despotism.
In this manner have nations warred with nations-even nations
which have given birth to other nations have thus risen up in violent
hostility against their own legitimate offspring! And each, possessing the sentiment of natural dignity, has resented the invasion. And
thus have men poured out the living blood of one another, reaping
no lessons from the undisturbed tranquillity of their parent Nature
which breathed them into being; recognising no high principles of
justice and reciprocation; but rather, at the sacrifice of all these essential principles, they have fought one with another as if Nature had
in them misconceived, and mis-adapted her harmonious, divine, and
immortal principles!
The western hemisphere became thus peopled, the minutiae of
the history of which may be traced in the writings of modern historians.  So also is the national history of other countries on record,
and speaks but too plainly of the errors of bygone ages.
Who now can read with undisturbed feelings the records of the
barbarous massacres, inhuman persecutions, and unnatural and corrupt conditions, that are contained in the history of every nation upon
the face of the earth?   Who can contemplate the persecutions of
centuries past with feelings of pleasure or complacency?  Who
among the inhabitants of the whole earth can with feelings of pleasure
peruse the records of the destructive and immoral proceedings of
chieftains, potentates, kings, popes, and emperors, who were uplifted
in their own minds and wielded the almost omnipotent influence of
a superficial and chimerical theology?  Have not ingenious and designing men appealed to the mythological gods of their respective
nations to sanctify their despotic governments?  Has not one chieftain after another proceeded in the same manner to carry out his
misdirected and unnatural desires, at the absolute sacrifice of all

morality, and of all natural and divine principles? 0 Man, whom
Nature by her immortal energies has created! can you not now see
the towering monuments erected from the materials of past history,
to remind subsequent generations of the results of the misdirection
of man's faculties and the pollution of his internal possessions? Do
you not now see that these monuments will be reared still higher by
generations yet unborn, if you do not exert your powers to remove
their foundations, and to erect in their stead the temple of light, liberty, peace, and righteousness? Remain unmoved, and the great
ocean of ignorance, folly, and imbecility, will rise to its highest tide,
and you will be but floating particles upon its surface.  But exert
your powers as truth and duty require, and the sparkling rill of human progress will glide onward through the many recesses of social
existence, and its many tributaries will all converge to form one grand
stream of natural thought and affection, and this will flow onward
until it is merged in the great ocean of universal knowledge and
peace. And this ocean will flow onward with a tide that shall never
ebb, throughout the realms of the immortal spheres!
The germ of purity and goodness, of love and wisdom, of morality
and happiness, is in man. Become instructed, therefore, concerning
its existence and essential qualities, so that it may be caressed, fostered, and cultivated —so that it may send forth roots that will gather
nourishment from the congenial elements around it, and spontaneously unfold a substantial body, one that can not be shaken or removed.  Let this, again, put forth tender branches that will extend
throughout the avenues of Nature; and let these branches unfold tile
buds of innocence and the blossoms of beauty and righteousness that
will breathe forth a firagrance of celestial love and wisdom ascending
to the highest point of perfection.
~ 84. The whole world is now peopled by beings of the most
diversified characters and dispositions, each nation and tribe differing
from others in habits, customs, and government-each partaking of
different particles of food, breathing a different atmosphere, displaying different features of anatomical structure and physiological development, having different complexions, speaking different languages
and dialects, possessing different primitive traditions, endeavoring to
sustain different opinions, political and theological, and being actuated by different motives and different conceptions of the just and

good;  Thus is the earth peopled: and thus has Nature " put forth
her most tender efforts to yield a happy race."
But as the history of every nation will set forth its own experience,
I am not impressed to enter into the minutiae thereof.  But in order
to present a glance at the vast field of human history, I have thus
generalized the race from the period it assumed the form of the
human, and was properly termed Man, to the present distribution of
the branches of the original family over the face of the earth.
They have been properly classified into five distinct varieties,
though it is not true that there are five types of the human family.
For it can be demonstrated upon anatomical and physiological principles, that the human race as now existing, with all the diversified
conditions and developments which distinguish its five classible varieties, has ascended from one original type.
The varieties of mankind have been classified in. the following
manner: First, the Caucasians, which extended firom  India into
north Africa and into Europe (and hence are termed Indo-Europeansi;
secondly, the MlIongoolians, which exist in eastern Asia, extending
also toward Africa; thirdly, the Malayans, which exist in India, Africa, and other portions of the eastern hemisphere, extending into the
southern islands; fourthly, the Negroes, which are confined to Afirica;
and fifthly, the American Indians.  This classification is very proper,
and needs no modification, as these are indeed the exemplifiers of all
existing features and complexions.  For the Indians are red, the
Malayans brown, the Mongolians yellow, the Negroes black, and the
Caucasians white.
It needs, however, but little argument to establish the commfon origin of these dissimilar colors.  The original inhabitants were black;
the subsequent nations were brown; the branches of these were red;
friom these sprang the yellow, and from these the white.  White and
black, then, it will be observed, are apparent opposites.  There never
was known an instance in which that which was perfectly white brought
forth its opposite, black. There have been instances known of the
black bringing forth white, or a color approaching thereunto. There
are several accounts on record of the white bringing forth dark or
black offspring; but these accounts will not admit of analyzation.
The alleged facts of this nature did not occur under the immediate
cognizance of an investigator; but the accounts of them were received from the mouth of the parents, and hence are not allowable
Meanwhile let it be observed that such an occurrence would be op.

posed to every law of development.  Such instances have occurred
partially, from an arrest of utero-gestation, which caused the ultimate
portions of the blood to become so assimilated with the cellular and
serous tissues of the foetus, as to render the body variously colored,
-black, brown, red, or copper color- according to the advancement
of the period of gestation at which the arrest occurred.  Whatever
facts, then, may have been observed in the Jalofs, Mandingoes, Caffers, and Albinoes, these can not possibly have any weight when
brought against the universal testimony of Nature in her varied departments of natural development.
But I will describe the process of the transformation of color, the
means required and the conditions necessary for this transformation,
and the local circumstances upon which color is dependent.  To
understand this properly, we must first understand the laws governing copulation and the reproduction of the human form.  As it does
not become the character of this work to enter into the particulars of
this department of Nature's operations, I am compelled to speak on
this subject briefly and in general terms.
In the first place, let it be understood that conception never occurs
unless there exist a mutual sympathy and a unity of purpose.  This,
then, is the first condition required for a proper imp:ess of the human
type, and for the production of a corresponding organization.  The
parts that are excited receive at once the conjugated, assimilated particles evolved fiom  every department of the human system-and
this by virtue of the sympathy which also determines the quality of
the assimilation.  These particles contain not only the sympathetic
impress of the humnan organization, but of all its essential parts, even
to complexion. This complexion is only a more perfect manifestation of what is known to physicians as the ncavus matcrnus.  It is
dependent altogether upon the condition last mentioned.  In this
way, therefore, is the human type, and even its color, reproduced.
These facts holding good with regard to the original inhabitants
of the earth, the black impress could of course grow no blacker.  But
during the process of nearly two centuries, the complexion of the
generation then existing became essentially modified, so much so that
it was permanently brown, owing to the change of atmosplhere, climate, food, and local conditions.  In like manner was one color
after the other permanently established by changes of a dissimilar but
of an equally effectual nature.  The complexions thus established
are not unchangeable, yet they will remain as they are, in each of

the various classes, until. new and remodifying conditions are produced, both as to their local existence, habits, and customs, and in
the -earth and atmosphere, upon which stature, symmetry, strength,
and complexion, are to an extent dependent.
Such is the present form of the race; and such are the classifications under which it may be comprehended. And I am directed to
speak concerning these things no more-at least until it becomes
expedient to do so in correcting some misconceptions of these modes
of progressive development by those who may be inclined to investigate Nature's stupendous manifestations by their powers of sensuous
perception.
S~ 5. The reason is now made manifest why the paietiological
sciences and the science of correspondences were introduced and
dwelt upon in the Key. For it becomes now the office of these sciences to unfold the primitive physical condition of the race, and to
illustrate its advancement and'progress by correspondences and symbolic representations.
In analyzing the essential elements of speech, it is necessary to
descend to the conditions friom which sprang the first conception of a
process of communicating ideas. And in connexion with what has
been said upon the subject, I will proceed to analyze language, and
to unfold its origin and progress.
The word languagoe is derived fiom the Latin lingua, which signifies tongue.  I am impressed, however, that this does not convey
the essential idea of mental or vocal communication.  For, as has
been stated, the original inhabitants conceived thoughts, and these
were expressed upon their countenances, by the eye, by configurations of the face, by manual manifestations, and by outward signs and
symbols that were suggested by the character of the thoughts conceived.  Impressions were made upon their senses, which impressions were correspondingly transferred to the internal principle which
evolves thought.  This thought, in order to be conveyed to the mind
of another, must be distinctly expressed, typified, or exemplified,
by the eye, countenance, gestures, or by symbolical representation.
This, therefore, is the philosophy of the vocal or physical expression
of the thoughts, feelings, sentiments, or affections, of the internal,
living principle.
In this way the original inhabitants began to convey their crude,
confused thoughts to one another.  Their internals being imperfectly

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                369
developed, this prevented the spontaneous evolving of those perfect
and distinct thoughts which are expressed by uniform and substantial
outward representatives.  Hence there soon arose a disunity among
them, because of the dissimilarity of verbal and physical expression.
But I will not dwell upon the effects which were thus produced, but
proceed to state connectedly the advancement and modification of
the internal language of correspondences.
Mankind began first to express their thoughts by the configurations
of their countenances.  When they loved, their countenance indicated
a smile of pleasure approximating to a brilliant illumination. When
their thoughts descended into things hidden fromn their senses and
powers of comprehension, they would cast their eyes downward; and
when they were elevated, they would cast their eyes upward.  And
their countenances would also indicate pleasure, dread, and anger.
To describe speed, they would run with a corresponding speed. To
express apathy and ennui, they would repose in a manner corresponding to the thought which suggested the external expression.  Whenr
desirous of having food, they would express weakness and prostra —
tion. And so in like manner did they converse by signs naturally
suggested by the thought that was excited, either by the action of
outer objects through the senses, or by the influence of internal consciousnesses.
While this form of language remained un)changed by the inventions.
of the ingenious faculties, they were peacefully united; but when artificial signs began to assume the ascendency over these modes of
expression, then it was that their expressions became deceptive and:
unreal: and thus were greatly dissolved the unity of thought and the
harmonious social relations which previously subsisted among them..
From this period the branch nations began to construct objects cor —
responding to the ideas they intended to impress.  They formed
figures and symbolical representations, to express in a, distinct manner the general thoughts they conceived, making no effor.t as yet tot
use their vocal powers in expression.  Thus language proceeded
from manual and corporeal, to instrumental representation.
But they soon experienced an inconvenience from. the want of a
more perfect mode of expressing the many minor thioughts that were
constantly being suggested when they were in the presence of each.
other, and by their social conditions and general physical require —
ments.  And being thus perplexed, they began to represent their
minor thoughts by making certain distinct sounds, governed entirelyv

370            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
by the natural suggestion of the thought intended to be impressed.
In order that these sounds might in all instances convey the same
thought or idea, they endeavored to establish a rule by which each
should be governed in his vocal expression.  This was the rudimental conception of grammatical principles; for any given sounds or
words are by these principles made to convey to the mind, under all
conditions and -circumstances, the same thoughts or ideas.  This
rule which was adopted among the early nations, in order that their
vocal sounds might express the same thoughts under all circumstances, was soon discovered to be of great use in preserving the unity
of thqir existence and in affording the pleasure of distinctly communicating minor thoughts vocally one with another.
After this, and when the nations had become distributed into other
portions of the earth according to previous descriptions, these sounds
were represented by hieroglyphical characters, or minute figures and
strokes.  The same rule still determined the meaning of the sound;
and the impress of the sound was made upon some material substance, in order that the ideas thus rapidly expressed might be preserved for the instruction of succeeding generations.  Such was the
condition of language at the time of the settlement of Yucatan and
the adjoining portions.
For an indefinite period after this time, symbolical and co'rrespondential language remained unchanged among the inhabitants of the
earth.  There was no perceptible advancement in this for many centturies. But the next development of language was among the in-,habitants of Spain and Asia.  The first modified the existing, exter-:nal representations of ideas that were conceived by the previous
nations, into more perfect hieroglyphical forms, which were rendered
beautiful by the perfection of mechanical attainment to which they;had arrived.  They also drew figures on smooth substances, which
was the first suggestion of the art of painting.  And they carried
lthis to such a degree of perfection in Spain, that their representations,might properly be termed tpicture-language.
But the nations which dwelt in Asia preserved the verbal and.grammatical form of expression, and by improvements rendered it so
permanent that some remains of the same language are still existing:among various nations of Asia at the present day.  The inhabitants,of China became more confirmed in the monosyllabic language of
the southern nations than did any other people.  They also expressed thoughts in the language of correspondences, or representa

tions in the form of pictures and hieroglyphics.  The Chinese have
remained unchanged as to their manner of vocal communication;
while other languages were formed by the branch and distributed
nations of other portions of the eastern hemisplierr
~ 86. It is impossible to trace the etymologies of each tongue, inasmuch as there are so many varieties of idioms and dialects, and
even of conceptions and thoughts by which etymologies have been
determined.  And it would be of no utility to refer to the researches
of glossologists and etymologists; for each of these, in all his investigations, has only accumulated local, external facts, with the intention of establishing sotne particular hypothesis.  And deductions
made from facts thus accumulated are not warrantable nor useful as
a guide to inquiries respecting the origin and primitive form of language, and the process by which it has assumed its present innumnerable modifications.
Let it be observed, then, that the first elements of rudimental,
monosyllabic language, were contained in the hieroglyphic representations that were given of those sounds that were used among the
previous inhabitants as an advancement in the form of expression.
From this source sprang the Chinese language.  While this nation
was becoming confirmed in its form of expression derived from  the
original hieroglyphics, other nations, improving upon the original
style, adopted an entirely new form of grammatical, mechanical, and
vocal communication.  Thus from the impression of sounds, the orthography of the Greek language became established-which language was characterized by a form of synthetical expression unlike
that of any other language, and was governed by entirely dissimilar
grammatical rules.  Nouns, verbs, and adjectives, by the ascending
grammatical rule of the Greeks, were formed into syntax; and thus
these became established'as distinct parts of speech.
So, then, the classification of sounds determined the classification
of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositions, among the Greeks.
Each sign suggesting a vocal sound according to primitive usage,
they could, by associating theni together, according to these grammatical forms, make them convey to the minds'of each other distinct
ideas of any objects, substances, qualities, actions, or motives, concerning which they might have a desire to communicate their knowl
edge or impressions.  Thus the Greek language is nothing more
than an assemblage of minute symbols or distinct characters, the





## p. 372 (#400) ############################################


372            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
combination constituting the word, the word associating itself with
the sound, and the sound calling up the idea intended to be impressed. And what is the utility of the sense of hearing, if it is not
to receive impressions from sound corresponding to the impression
received from the form of a word, object, or substance, through the
sense of vision?
Another distinct nation originated firom their hereditary custom of
verbal intercourse, another distinct language or style of expression.
This was the Hebrew. Then followed in like manner the Latin,
and likewise all analogous tongues, dialects, and modes of corporeal
and hieroglyphical expression, that distinguish the various nations
upon the face of the earth.
It is well now to speak concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of
America.  They imbibed the early form of expression after they had
journeyed to this portion of the earth; but it was then imperfect,
having no grammatical rules to govern the sound, the gesture, or the
representation.  So they subsequently formed a class of sounds into
figures, which they would mark upon trees, bark, stones,, and other
suitable materials.  These figures they subsequently abandoned for
the successful invention of more minute characters, which, from an
undeveloped intellect and imperfect faculties of individualization, they
formed into compound expressions, which are exemplified in the
present polysyllabic speech of the Indians.  For they accumulate
many of these minute figures into an enormous compound expression
to convey a single thought to the mind-while one of the parts of
these compounds would not convey any thought, or represent anything, to their own or any other mind.
In contradistinction to this, every character of the Chinese language
is a substantial representative of a thought: and thus their language
is composed only of monosyllabic characters; while the Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, employ compound figures, letters, or characters, to
write or express a thought, and which are different from those employed by either of the other nations.
All this goes to prove that the external expression of thought, feeling, and sentiment, originated in the natural and corporeal configurations of the primitive inhabitants, and who, after being disunited
and entirely separated from each other, retained the early correspondences, and from them originated the various dissimilar modes of
expression that now prevail in the earth.
Primitive history conveys no reliable account of the language of

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  373
the inhabitants of the earth anterior to the confirmation of that of the
inhabitants of China.  Nevertheless, it was once supposed by soime
that the Greek was the first tongue spoken, as all the sacred writings
originally in possession of the Jews were in the Greek language.'
After this came the Jewish writings in Hebrew; which afterward, as
will hereafter be seen, were translated into Latin, and subsequently
into the Indo-European and English languages.
It is well to observe, that notwithstanding the conclusions of modern philologists and linguists who have searched profoundly into the
subject, that the hieroglyphics were intended as alphabetical representations, and not separately to convey thoughts, the hieroglyphics
did express substantial thoughts in the earlier ages: but they subsequently assumed the form of alphabetical representations, which are
nothing more than synthetical or compound forms of expression.
It is plain, therefore, that language is an external, artificial invention, and is nothing more than a hieroglyphical mode of expressing
sounds by compound signs. From the minute characters came letters. Letters began to be used as such on the ground of their conveying dissimilar sounds, before which time letters were words, but
since which, letters conjoined constitute a syllable or word, which
conveys a single or compound idea by the sound which is associated
in the mind with the thought.
Verbal, physical, hieroglyphical expression, is external, superficial,
deceptive, and injurious to the human race.  The present languages
and dialects of the various nations of the earth have arisen entirely as
a consequence of the misdirection of the sentient faculties and of the
judgment, which so unhappily befell the first-born of the human species.  But as language is connected inseparably with the origin of
thoughts, it will be further considered connectedly as I proceed to
notice the origin of the very many superficial, unnatural, misdi
rected thoughts which are at the present time obstructing the rising
tide of human progress. And in this connexion will the origin of
language and its improper, unholy, and corrupting tendencies, be'further explained.

have the whole world apprehend me aright, so that they may view in
their proper light the exposures which I give of all external, superficial, and chimerical sheathings of truths.  That the reader might understand the source from which my impressions flow, an explanation
would be required which would be in advance of the subject under
present consideration.  But I will briefly unfold the nature of the
impressions themselves, so that no misunderstanding may arise from
the unreserved generalizations of things which I term  unreal, chimerical, superficial, and opposed to the divine principles which pervade the Universe.
It will be perceived, by perusing what has been said as relating to
the physical and palwetiological history of our earth, that I descend
to the germn of human existence, and proceed to speak of the successive waves of development in each age and generation.  I do not
commence at the present established order of material forms and external creations, and collect facts as evidences of things antecedent
to the present time, with the intention of establishing any preconceived hypothesis. Mly descriptive remarks and arguments, therefore, must necessarily differ more or less from  those of any writer,
and from the pre-established opinions of the present generation.
Men have only been able to trace fiom the cxternal of the present
order of creation the things that have existed in the interior of the
world's history; and therefore the history of the world, of mankind,
of the various sciences, and of theology, are all understood only inl
the light of superficial evidence.  For it is impossible for them to
descend into the interior of the early history of the world and obtain
the knowledge of the things of which 1 speak, because the historical
accounts of all these things are limited, ambiguous, indefinite, and on
many points entirely unprofitable.  But I am impressed with a knowledge of the interior and germinal history of each thing of which I
speak.  I descend, therefore, to the lowest points of the particular
subjects on which I speak, and proceed in my descriptions according to the ascending developments of the same as necessarily flowing
out of the germ, and which finally come within the scope of historical knowledge and actual experience.
And, as was intimated in the Key, I am not impressed to descend
into the particulars of any subject, inasmuch as " particulars are the
unreal ramifications of general principles, unfolded to the external
observation of mankind."  Minuwtia, therefore, are, according to my
impressions, unrcal and cxcrescent, though these are often collected

is evidences to establish metaphysical hypotheses.  And as they are
unreal, I am compelled to disregard them; and thus I am laboring to establish general principles only by appeals to universal evidences.
Such are the promptings of the interior impressions or directions
which I receive. And whatever may be the likes or dislikes of any
of the many persons who may peruse these sayings, these can not
possibly have any influence upon the nature or expression of my impressions, which are demonstrated to me as real, and are consequent
ly righteous.
I have thus introductively prefaced my general remarks on hagaiography, bibliography, archaeology, and other dissimilar branches of
theology, an unfolding of which subjects will require a direct appeal to the teachings of that science which I term Correspondences.
I am compelled to descend into the subordinate departments of misdirected human thought and erroneous theology; and in doing this I
will describe the effects which have arisen out of the latter subject,
and which have been such as tend in a great degree to dissipate that
deep veneration which is wont to pervade the mind in contemplating
this subject, and to show that, after all, it is unworthy the nanie of
theology.
Innumerable works that have been written upon this subjectworks that have engaged the time and talents of many enlightened
men-demand great cautiousness and gentleness of treatment, yet
require to be revered only according to their interior purity and truthfulness. But the subject itself is one that has sacrificed more human
forms than it has ever benefited to the least extent.  It is a subject
that has disunited the thoughts, feelings, and affections, of children
and parents, and breathed the elements of folly, imbecility, and superstition, into the bosom of families, associations, and of once-united
and peaceful kingdoms.  It is a subject interwoven with the very
elements of imperfection; and as these elements have become developed, folly and internal darkness have pervaded every mind within
the circle of its influence.  And the folly and envy thus arising have
diffused in the world unutterable wretchedness. Hence, too, have
arisen sentiments of anger and other corrupt and corroding passions.
And anger has breathed vice and universal transgression of the principles of morality.  This transgression has clothed the whole race
with a mantle of sectarian bigotry, degrading ignorance, an d'judgment-revolting superstition.  Superstition has inspired chieftains with.

the spirit of tyranny and despotism, sustained potentates, elevated
theological shepherds, and plunged the uninformed inhabitants of the
earth into the lowest depths of poverty, mental darkness, imbecility,
and fanaticism.  The whole world, thus disunited in social and theological relations, has manifested only the extreme of misdirected
thought and unnatural imagination.  Every natural tendency of the
mental organization of man to breathe forth an element of universal
love, unity, peace, and harmony, has thus been checked and arrested.
The spiritual elements within man have not even yet unfolded their
gentle teachings, save in the minds of some noble beings, causing
these to proclaim  " peace on earth, and good-will to men."  But
mnost of these have been arrested in their career of purity and reformation, and compelled to yield to the ineffable injustice of the infuriate and enthusiastic governors that held within their grasp the alldevouring sword of persecution!
In later times, most worthy and gigantic intellects have descended
into the realms of primitive history, and unfolded the wild and horrible admonitions contained in the experience of generations past, and
presented these to the world.  These men were actuated by the
promptings of spiritual sympathy and universal benevolence.  They
endeavored to present truth by displaying the tendency of its opposite.  But their intellects were trammrelled by hereditary errors, by
improper education, and by unreal. external, and superficial impression.  The influence of their historical and metaphysical productions
was thtus impaired, and was diminished still more by coming in contact with local, national, and universal prejudices, which prejudices
to a great extent even yet clothe the fireeborn minds of mankind!
These men presented in their productions a heterogeneous mixture
of about five parts error and three parts truth.  Yet they felt a decided
interest in the banishment of error, and in the upbuilding and advancement of truth and virtue.  As this is a strong indication of innate
goodness, it deserves proper admiration and sympathy from all who
are engaged in the common work of reformation.  Sucll was the
character of the early reformers.
In pursuing the investigation of the subject upon whicb I am about
to enter, therefore, the deepest veneration is demanded for those profound, misdirected intellects, and a suitable attention should be given
to all their thoughilts, whether written or unwritten.  And it is on
this account only that I am impressed to speak of the general sub.
ject on which they wrote, in a reverential manner; but not on the

ground of its containing the least particle of intrinsic purity, or the
slightest element of practical utility.
~ S8. I now descend to the birth of mythological theology -which
theology is at the present day obscuring the highest and purest principles of the internal nature of man, destroying all elements of true
and natural morality, and absolutely driving men into every species
of vice, folly, disunity of interests, and consequent wretchedness.
Let us first analyze the word theology, as an understanding of this
lies at the basis of a proper investigation of the subject before us.
Tile word Tlleos is a Greek word signifying the same as the Latin.Deus, and is intended to represent, as may be discovered in the Zend
Avesta of Zoroaster, the Supreme, moving Spirit that pervades the
Universe, whom we call God.  Tile Greek Theos, and Latin Deus,
are words derived from sounds destitute of signification, and the origin
of which is impure.
HIere, then, is manifested the imperfection and injurious tendency
of vocal or written expression.  For there never was a sound formed
or a word uttered that could convey the least conception of that allpervading ESSENCE, that Great Spiritual PRINCIPLE, that Great
Positive, Omnipotent MIND, which dwells in the VORTEX  firom
which flow millions on millions of Suns, of Systems, of Universes,
that extend out into undefinable space almost to the filling of space
itself-and yet all constituting nothing more than an expression of
one single THOUGHT emanating from the inexhaustible Vortex of infinite Purity and Perfection!  No word or phrase has ever been
uttered -and I do not except the phrase which I have been directed
to employ-that has ever conveyed to the mind of man in this, its
first sphere of existence, the least possible conception of the INFIN1TE, DIVINE PRINCIPLE.  I associate, therefore, with the words
Theos and Deus no lofty thought which gushes from the spirit within,
as an element of veneration.
Concerning the many conceptions which sprang fromn the youthful
and misguided intellects of the first-born of the human species, much
might be related if we were to enter into particulars.  But as the object is to relate the origin of mythological theology, I must speak in
general terms': but I will notice specifically the birth of the most
prominent conceptions, such as have been perpetuated in various
forms to the present day, and are now trammelling and paralyzing

the powers of man, embarrassing his social relations, and obstructing
his spiritual development.
When the first inhabitants were in a youtllful state (or when they
were uninstructed concerning the principles governing their existence),
their tender and uncultivated intellects rendered them susceptible to
the direful influence of misunderstanding, and of consequent deception and disunity.  In connexion, then, with what has been previously related, I will now speak of the social condition of, and unhappy physical circumstances that surrounded, the youthful family.
They dwelt a long period peacefully and harmoniously united
one with another, and continued thus so long as they observed the
natural language of the principle within, by figures, motions, gesticulations, and configurations of the countenance, which were so real
and so truly expressive of the actual thoughts and affections of the
mind.  But when they discovered their ability to produce vocal
sounds, they took advantage of this discovery, and began cornmrnunicating their thoughts in that manner: for they felt that it was novel,
pleasing, and expedient.  They soon lost their primitive habit of radiated expressions, and with it the perfect purity of their interior
thoughts.  Misunderstanding each other's thoughts and intentions
from the dissimilarity of sounds that were emnployed, they became
envious, cruel, and deceptive; because sounds were capable of expressing thoughts of altogether a different nature from those that were
dwelling in the interior of the individuals conversing.  They were
unlike the inhabitants discovered upon the planet Mercury: for they,
as has been related, despise the externals of thought (which are words),
as they dislike the clothing and concealing of truths by false and deceptive expressions.
And after the inhabitants became thus socially miserable because
of disunity of feeling and disorganization, they wondered as to the
cause of this evil. They were not advanced sufficiently in intellectual discernment to discover the actual cause within their midst, and
so one who was more intelligent than the rest began to proclaim  a
pretended discovery of the cause, and thus was looked upon by his
extensive relations as an inspired chieftain.  He had discovered (as
he related to them with countenance becoming his assumed position)
that the " breaths" (winds), which came from above, breathed among
them a malignant element.-And this was the first conception of the
origin of evil. This was a prevailing opinion for many ages, during
which time the inhabitants became distributed as has been described.





## p. 379 (#407) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 379
But in other settlements of the original family, advanced intellects
began to search a little further, and to inquire for the cause of these
"breaths."  Not being acquainted with the disturbances constantly
occurring in the equilibrium of the atmosphere, tlley consequently
attributed the cause of these " breaths" to an unseen, undefinable evil
spirit, which they supposed hovered over the whole landscape or
disk on which the)y dwelt.  They supposed the atmosphere to constitute this spirit. So this was an advance of one step in the prevailing theology among them.
The subsequent generations could not let the cause of the evil remain here (for envy, war, and deception, had evidently increased):
so they abandoned the impression given them  by their forefathers
that the atmosllhere was the cause, for the belief that (as a philosopher
among them endeavored to demonstrate by hieroglyphical illustrations)
the Sun was the face of an angry, unholy, and evil-disseminating
being, and that he caused the atmosphere to breathe this evil into
their minds.  This pllilosopher, therefore, was adored as being the
inspired son of previous generations.  They began to fear his presence.  They trembled at the images which he shadowed forth in
hieroglyphical characters; they fell before and worshipped him with
all the expressions of veneration that characterized the ceremonies
of subsequent idolatry.  They built a large and massive edifice, with
anartmrnents constructed to his will, and elevated him to the highest
seat in this temple, and lie became the chieftain, prophet, emperor,
and god, of all the nations and tribes within the circle of his influence.  For he had discovered their great enemy, their fiery dens,
their angry and consuming antagonist, which would, as he instructed
them, consume the disk upon which they lived-consume their
bodies and swallow up their spirits in the invisible envelope that surrounded the globe. This he taught them would all transpire, were
it not for his almost omnipotent presence.  And there is a passage
which applies to them as appropriately as to the inhabitants of the
earth at the present era, and which was uttered in contemplation of a
similar condition, saying, " The priests bear rule, and the people lore
to have it so."
~ 89. And now it would be well to suspend our archaeological investigations for a brief space, to notice the physical and social advancement of the race, together with the progress of the primitive
-node of expression.  It will be understood from that already related,

that they had cultivated the powers of mechanical construction. They
invented instruments to facilitate the labors in which they engaged:
and in proportion to the perfection of their instruments, were theyenabled to produce mechanical and architectural creations.  And,
being assisted by camels and other animals, they built large cities,
constructed elegant mansions, majestic edifices, and lofty templestogether with all degrees of minor buildings that were suggested by
their desires.
And what is most remarkable is that their buildings represented
their thoughts.  In this manner were they instructed by correspondences in the history of previous families, and concerning the novel
disclosures made by their supreme potentate.  The little buildings
corresponded variously to desires for certain species of wood, and
for vegetables, animals, and birds, of various descriptions, which constituted the food of their forefathers, and the appetite for which they
still inherited. So one building would represent the external form
of a delicious fruit which they admired; and when any one desired
this fruit, he would point to its representative.  So with the other
minor buildings, which corresponded to other specific objects for
which they might have.a desire.  Edifices were so constructed as to
represent the precise theological impressions that were existing among
the previous inhabitants.  Thus edifices were constrticted with vaulted interiors and huge, frightful forms, with mouths extended, representing the breathing of evil and its controlling influence.  Their
mansions were made in a vortical style, with portions open through
which could be seen in the interior a representation of the face of the
supposed invisible, evil spirit which represented the atmosphere.
Their lofty, aspiring temples corresponded, both in their interior and
external structure, to the inconceivable and consuming vengeance of
the Sun, which was the being they so much abhorred.  Around
these temples were placed brazen images, and the heads of the most
frightful monsters conceivable: and the greatest of the temples contained their great chieftain, to whom  they bowed with fearful dread
and with the external appearance of humiliation, The minor temples
contained the subordinate officers, or the chosen of the potentate, to
ascend to his presence and convey mandates to the weak, imbecile,
and uneducated inhabitants within his government.
This was the first of hieroglyphical language; for their cities were
their history, school, and creed.  And everythling was constructed
to represent some external object, or some conception of the mind

which was as unreal and evanescent as the particles of stone and clay
which constituted their huge cities.  Thus it was with the original
inhabitants of Central America and Pompeii.
At length their governor, finding it possible to conceive of the
resting-place of the Sun their deity, began to improve on the longestablished opinion, by putting forth a discovery which he professed
to have made, that the Sun was merely a representative of an inconceivable fountain of fire which existed in the realms below the huge
animal on whose back lie said they dwelt.  This idea in succeeding
ages became confirmed in the following form: That the Sun arose
after the spirit of darkness had passed away, and represented to them,
during many hours, the great fountain from which it sprang, and into
the depths of which they must inevitably descend, if they did not
obey all the mandates and requirements of their potential governor.
After having spoken to them  in such fiery language, it was believed
that it descended to become reclothed with the contents of the fiery
abyss, that thus it might be enabled to disseminate among the inhabitahts, on the succeeding day, the atmosphere, the heat, the invisible
spirit, or "breath," that proclaimed to them  inevitable destruction
for ever, if they dared but once to violate the despotic commands of
their potentate.
Thus it will be seen that as the intellect improves, even though it
be at first misdirected, true or untrue research and investigation will,
as a consequence,. ensue.
Behold, now, the overawing aspect of a gross and unmeaning
error!  See the improved faculties of later generations composing,
from the gross materials of the primitive famnily, a most gigantic and
imperative belief-even one claiming authority to govern the freeborn minds of mankind! First the wind, then the atmosphere, and
finally the warmth and light of the sun, were charged with producing
that which resulted merely from a disunity of the social interests and
consequently of the feelings, affections, and intentions, of the first inhabitants of the earth! And as intelligence advanced, it became necessary
to remove the fount of evil firom the Sun to some inconceivable realms
below, where human eyes and human knowledge could not demonstrate its non-existence!  The Sun was too plain an object to continue as of itsef the supposed originator of evil: for if, by the investigations of some persons who were living, it had been discovered that
the Sun was not in reality the source of evil, and that it.did not inspire the mind with evil and deceptive thoughts, then the great error

would have been exploded for ever, and the inhabitants of the earth
would have been delivered from their bondage of corruption into the
glorious light and liberty of the children of purity and innocence.
But the potentate, who was sufficiently shrewd and learned in the
art of deception, discovered that this would be the inevitable result
of such an exposure.  And feeling that his power would diminish,
that his influence would be lost, his government overthrown, and
his empire ruined, he, impelled by a desire to prevent this misfortune, removed the source of evil to a place so low, so deep, and so
obscure, that it was impossible, as he felt assured, for the deception
to ever be discovered or exposed. And thus he succeeded in establishing a sublime chimera, the modified elements of which enter
largely into the theological opinions of the rresent day.
I am impressed to speak with distinctness on this subject, in order
that the germ of error which was deposited in the world by the early
inhabitants, may not still continue to grow in such luxuriance in the
minds of mankind.
~ 90. I now proceed to describe the mental culture of the inhabitants of the interior of Asia, and of those existing upon the borders
of the African continent.  It is well to remark that it is impossible
for me to employ names or words which can possibly designate more
definitely to the reader those tribes of which I speak.  For this is a
period in the world's history when cities, localities, nations, tribes,
and other specific things, had not as yet received names, at least
such names as would now be known.  It will be remembered that
the primitive family dwelt in Asia, and that from  their minds sprang
the unreal conception of the origin of evil.  And I will now relate
the progress of that mis-iripression among the eastern tribes and
nations.
After the distribution to other locations of the more advanced portions of the original family, those who remained were not sufficiently
developed in their faculties to improve on the original conceptionuntil a subsequent generation (which continued to imbibe the early
idea) produced a mind who was capable of improving upon their hereditary impressions.  But his mythology proceeded in an opposite
direction to that of the European nations.  Knowing not of each
other's doctrines, and being so separated from  one another, it was
impossible for the nations to commune with each other, or to modify
bl this means, to any possible extent, the features of their advancing





## p. 383 (#411) ############################################


NATURE.S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 383
theology.  So the subsequent eastern tribes originated a doctrine
dissimilar to that of other nations, from the opinions ascending to
them through the successive generations, from the primitive family.
Tradition was at that time the medium of historical information.
By tradition I mean the vocal mode of expression by which the first
inhabitants communicated their opinions and experience to each succeeding generation.  This enlightened mind of which I speak, among
the eastern tribes, conceived of a doctrine which he taught the people
was impressed upon his mind by some good-influencing spirit that
dwelt in one of those " breaths" which their forefathers had been
taught to believe were the origin of evil.
Concerning the social condition of these tribes, some things might
with profit be said; and these things, it will be seen, were manifestly
the reason why a different theology sprang up in their midst. Three
tribes dwelt in Asia, respectively on the locations now occupied by
the Japanese, Malayans, and Indo-Persians.  The first of these tribes
journeyed in the direction of the African continent, and soon discovered a beautiful valley, which has since been named Shinar.* And
they sent messengers to their kindred tribes, which resulted in the
journeying also of these tribes to this valley, where they, united,
formed a youthful nation, and dwelt together for many generations,
in the most perfect peace and harmony.
It would be well to notice the causes of this happy consociality.
Surrounding portions of Africa and Asia were very fertile in useful
productions of the vegetable kingdom.  Also many trees yielded a
kind of milk, of which they made extensive use.  And with their
hunting-implements they would often succeed in slaying certain species of animals, which also composed a great portion of their food.
Being thus conditioned, and all their physical wants being supplied,
they turned their attention to the cultivation of their faculties, and
became expert in the construction of some very beautiful and delicate
things.  It would be well to mention that the Chinese of the present
day display the perfection of all the delicate, eccentric, and fantastic
inventions such as were first the work of these people.  They began
by forming many articles of embroidery from grass and the fibres of
a certain kind of tree.  Among other things, they formed singular
coverings for the head, and also garments consisting of closely-interwoven grass and fibres, and lined with the skin of animals.  Such
were the arts which they cultivated.
* See Genesis xi. 2.

Their social condition beingr favorable, this as a consequence produced a more perfect degree of mental tranquillity; and as a result
of this, higher and better theological ideas sprang up among them.
So while things were thus situated, the mind of which I have spoken
put forth a new opinion. I will repeat his thoughts, although they
are unrecorded:"The great waters," said he, " contained the spirit of which your
forefathers have spoken.  And at that time water alone was existing.
The great spirit formed this ground, and these many things about us,
and the many gods above us and their grounds, and the grounds that
extend further than the great spirit can see.  This spirit was then,
while in the waters, asleep.  And they called him  Parama.  But
when he desired to have some living objects to worship him, he
awoke from his repose, and breathed forth a spirit throughout all the
waters, and the waters moved firom their great depths.  And this
spirit which moved the waters was called Narasayana."  INar, in
the original Indian language, means water, and sayana signifies power
to move; and thus the two conjoined mean moving, waters.  In the
depths of the waters, he taught them, was created a great egg.  This,
by the moving of the waters, finally expanded, unfolded its contents, and formed instantaneously the ground upon which they lived.
Thus, he taught them, the world was created.
Together with the earth, he said the spirit Vishnu (which was the
second spirit) created the human form-which he placed, as their
forefathers taught, in a beautiful garden abounding with many delicious fruits, and from which went forth a stream that was divided
into three, corresponding to tile great spirits Pararna,.Narastayana,
and Vishnu.  He then said that the great spirit left the waters (for
the waters had then become land), and ascended into realms beyond
the extent of their knowledge, and would only make his appearance
to him (the inspired chieftain), whenever the people would consent
to have one of their much-admired females sacrificed to his glory.
The spirit which proceeded from Paramna (which was Vishnu)
still remained near the earth, and was not so good a spirit as the one
who sent him forth to create man.  And the third spirit, or the spirit
which dwelt in those "breaths," was the most evil of them all, and
was endeavoring to produce an eternal separation between the spirit
that dwelt within man and the great spirit Parama.  "And," said he,
" it is I who preserves you from the wrath of this spirit.  And if you
will consent to offer sacrifices, it will assist me to appease his wrath,

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                    3S5
and you will not sink into the bowels of the earth, where another
egg still remains, and where the spirit that produces these' breaths,'
of whom we have been told by our forefathers, shall be compelled
to live for ever, among the spirits which he has persuaded and captured."   Thus, he instructed them, they would live, according to
the manner in which they had lived before, either near the throne of
Parama, or in this great egg with the spirit which caused their forefathers to become evil by breathing evil into their minds.
I would request those who desire to be instructed concerning the
truthfulness of this statement, to peruse the writings of subsequent
and more matured, yet no less misdirected minds, such as Hesiod
(whom Homer speaks of* extensively, and from whom lie received
many of his ambiguous and allegorical comparisons), Thales, Pythagoras, and also the Zend Aresta of Zoroaster, who received friom
the tradition of these nations the rudiments of his philosophy.
~ 91. Notwithstanding it is in advance of the subject under consideration, I will briefly state the system of Zoroaster, in which the.
same ideas may be perceived, with the exception of being more
thoroughly systematized and more clearly expressed.
The great spirit recognised by the eastern tribe under the name
of Parama (subsequently termed Brahlma), is named by Zoroaster
Ormuzd.  This being, lhe taught, was the one who existed in realms
beyond the conception of man.  This was a good being; and there
were constantly ascending to, and descending from', his presence,
subordinate good spirits (elohlims).  These occupied a sphere or
station somewhat beneath Ormuzd.  Below  these still. wveas. another
circle of angels or spirits that were still less good, than those above
them.  These were the first or lower elohims; and the highlor and
superior ones were ainmsaspands, or angels that were permitted, on
account of their being superior in goodness to the former ones, to
ascend to the presence of Ormuzd.  The latter, being a good spirit,
was an eternal hater of evil.
In contradistinction to this being, Zoroaster elevated the Vishnit
and Narasayana spirit of the eastern theologian to  a position as
* When subsequently questioned concerning this passage, the author stated that
Homer and Hesiod were contemporary, and that Hesiod collleted traditions of the
demonology of the ancients, and Homer poetized them. The phrase, " whom Homer
speaks of," I suppose, therefore, means simply " whom Homer refers to or quotes;"'
though I preserve the expression as I find it in my notes. Allusion is again made
to this subiect in the sequel.

lofty and commanding as Ormuzd.  Him he named Ahrzmnan.  He
was an evil spirit, and an eternal hater of all goodness.  In a sphere
or circle beneath this spirit, Zoroaster also placed a legion of subordinate spirits -and also another sphere of evil spirits beneath these,
according to their degree of wickedness.
By tile power of Ormuzd, the earth and man were made. By the
power of Alriman, the world and mankind were made sinful and
disgusting in the sight of the good spirits: and he also prevented the
spirit within man from being pure and good, as was desired by the
good being.  Zoroaster also conceived that these two beings, together with their mighty hosts, were engaged in a mighty war.  And
hlie prophesied that finally the wicked spirit and his kingdom would
be destroyed for ever, and that the world and the race would then
be made good in the sight of Ormuzd, who would, after the whole
race had become amshaspands, exult in view of the conquest for ever
and ever.
Peruse also the sayings of Xenophon, Socrates, and Plato, and
iearn fiomn these the demonology of the primitive inhabitants of the
earth. Learn from these also the subsequent modifications of theological idealism, as a result of intellectual advancement.  But I am
impressed to return and continue the previous description.
The subsequent tribes became confirmed in the opinion advanced
by this instructed chieftain-who did very much better in putting
forth his ideal conceptions to his brethren, than have a great many:studious, erudite, and well-meaning theologians, of the present day.
And there is a prominent point in this oriental theologian's doctrine
which is more productive of good consequences than many opinions
of subsequent ages.
They had advanced but little in the art of writing or impressing
itheir thoughts upon external objects.  So lhe could only promulgate
his opinions vocally, and could not write them and hand them down
to subsequent generations.  And indeed it rs to be lamented that
wvriting has been subsequently enmployed as a medium to transfer crude
and gross conceptions to the  minds of generation after generation, and
that these have thus been perpetuated even unto the present time.
Error began with man-because of his innocent and uninstructed
faculties; because he did not observe those conditions which were
required for his happiness; and because he cultivated a deceptive artificiality instead of interior purity and refinement. And from a mioute rill, human error increased to a vast ocean, the many nations of

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                387
the earth being its tributaries.  The contaminations and sophistications of these flowed into the great stream of human iniquity.  This
has covered the whole face of the earth; it has washed every bosom
of peacefulness, and left only the dregs of wretchedness and imbecility. It has prostrated and desolated nations; it has consumed and
swallowed up the principles of morality and refinement which are
mnan's by stature. And the presetlt generation also is partly immersed
in the great ocean of iniquity and misdirection.  Their true condition
is to them unknown; but they are in, and upon the margin of, the
great sea of vice and misery, and will be overwhelmed in the waves
of wretchedness, if they do not now receive instruction, and endeavor
to gain the ark of truth and everlasting protection which is still floating upon the tide.
From these things it can be distinctly seen that the origin of evil
was in the errors of human association, and not in those " winds,"
spirits, gods, demnons, or supreme potentates, whom man, firom the
beginning to this present time, has been falsely accusing.
But, as I have related, these eastern tribes still continued to exist
in unity of feeling and interest, and they imbibed and cherished the
new doctrines of their leader.  HIowever, affairs were not always to
continue thus: for about the middle of the fourth generation, this nation became divided by some social discrepancy, and one tribe journeyed to the east and located where China now is; another to the
east of Asia; another to where Egypt is; and the remainder continued as before.
I am impressed that the theology of the southern European nation,
and also that of these tribes, remained about the same until transpired
the event in the physical history of the earth, known as the deluge.
As we proceed, I will mention the origin of the "p'imnitive history,"
of which I have heretofore spoken.  But it is necessary, before I
describe the deluge now impending, to notice the origin of some sayings in the same history recorded previously to the account of the
deluge.  And I am deeply impressed that the world should make
their acknowledgment to the writer of the book of Genesis for conveying to them a distinct and truthful history of all early traditional
theology and mythological impressions.
~ 92. It is well to mention that the book of Genesis was writteni
by the Jews in Persia, at which time a branch of this people were

388             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
held in captivity.* And the accounts therein contained are exceedingly truthful, as they present a general reflection of the theology of
the Persians as received from traditional history and systematized by
Zoroaster.
That the parallelism may be observed between the previous conception of the chieftain of the eastern tribe, and the ultimate generalization of the same account contained in the first chapter of Genesis,
t will be remembered that this chieftain proclaimed to his people
that Parama dwelt in the great waters, and had there reposed for
many ages': which corresponds to the passage in the " primitive history" which reads as follows: " And the earth was without form and
void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of
God moved upon the face of the waters."  The eastern philosopher
said that "Brahma  breathed forth a spirit" (which was Narasayana,
meaning moving waters).  And the passage which reads, "And
darkness was upon the face of the deep," was derived from the passage in the Sanscrit language, which reads, " And Brahma was within
the great waters and was asleep];" the word " asleep" being rendered
"darkness" in the other passage.
In the eastern mythology the account continues, "And Brahma
moved from off the waters, and the egg formed the grounds and the
breaths;" while in connexion, the " primitive history" relates it in
this manner: " In the beginning God (meaning Brahma) created the
heaven and the earth.-" "Heaven" is, in the Sanscrit language,
rendered "breaths:" in the Hebrew, "shemayim" —meaning the
atmosphere.  And according to the Sanscrit version of the eastern
myth, " the spirit" which was sleeping (meaning darkness) " left the
waters, and light appeared: and Brahma saw that it was good."
Moreover, this chieftain of the east retained the early impressions
of the race, which came to him by tradition through the previous
generations, in an imrnerfect manner.  So.having lost a part of the
original impression concerning the condition of the early inhabitants,
he related it in a modified form, as he received it, in the account of
his deity's creation.  And it then suggested these thoughts to his
mind: That after Parama had moved the waters, and they had
* In answer to an inquiry, the author subsequently stated that this was a captivity
of a small portion of one Jewish tribe, which occurred a long period before the
Babylonish captivity, but of which we have no historical record. The reader should
also bear in mind that he is here speaking of the origin particularly of the first part
of the book of Genesis, containing the history of the creation, tlie deluge, &c., &c.

brought forth the world by tile development of the qualities of the
egg, they at the same time formed man, and located him in a beautiful and fertile place, according to the knowledge they had of their
forefathers' history: and he appealed to tile knowledge of the generation then existing, which confirmed in their minds, not only the
truthfulness of his cosmogony, but also of the account related by
their forefathers.
And the account in tile "primitive history"' merely exhibits a
change from the crude and particular manner in which he related his
theory, to that of a general description — which is as follows: "Let
us make man" ("us" meaning Brahma and Vishnu, the good and
the subordinate spirit).  " So God made man, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul."  This is
rendered from  the eastern mythology into the Sanscrit language in
the following manner: " With the earth, man was formed; and the'breaths' awoke him, and he was evil."
"And God planted a garden, and placed in it the man whom he
ilad created." This is rendered in the Sanscrit language from the
tradition of this eastern nation, " And he [meaning man] was placed
on a portion of the ground where grew trees, and flowers, and delicious fruits; which made our fathers happy, and pleased the great
spirit Brabma."
Again, the " primitive history"relates that " God saw that it was
not good for man to be alone.  So he caused a deep sleep to fall
upon Adam, and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
thereof. And of the rib made he a woman, and gave her unto the
man."  This the eastern chieftain taught in the following manner,
and thus is it written in the Sanscrit: "And while their fathers were
pleased with the beauty of the good spirit about them, they felt lonely; and while they felt thus, Paramna caused them to be asleep. And
while they were still as the great waters, the good spirit sent thern
from his hand a weaker number of mothers and other brethren. And
the good spirit caused the fathers to awake: and they beheld each
other, and our fathers loved them.  And then they lived together,
one with another: and the good spirit Parama was pleased."
According to previous description, these two tribes or families be
came located in separate places without knowing of each other's
existence.  The people of one tribe being matured, strong, and gi-.gantically constituted, were called by the eastern chieftain "their
fathers."  These were in eastern Asia.  And the other tribe was an

mperfectly-constituted and effeminate one; and they ultimately, as
nas been related, discovered the more-matured tribe, and the two
became conjoined as one farnily.  From that family sprang all the
traditional impressions which the eastern chieftain received; and
upon these he improved and established his theology, until became
established the Sanscrit language, and the Pracrit and Magadhi, the
rudiments of which enter into the Indo-Chinese language.  From
the same common source came tile rudiments of the Greek; at which
time the Hebrew was almost as perfectly established - and the Latin
also.
So these traditional demonological impressions were preserved in
characters up to the establishment of the Sanscrit language- were
translated by some Germanic tribes* into the Greek -and those that
were translated fell into the possession of the Jews-were compiled
and transcribed into Hebrew-then were carried by a detached por
tion of a tribe into the Persianic kingdom-remained there for several centuries, until Zoroaster finally systematized the crude theolog)
of the original manuscripts, and which was the prevailing theology,
among other nations as well as the Persians. And by the Persian
army besieging some parts of the Jewish nation, they became exasperated against the Persians, which terminated in the sacrifice of
their liberty, and they were held under the Persian government in
captivity.  At this time the Jewsr'e-transcribed the contents of these
manuscripts into their own language, and carried the same with them
at the expiration of their term of bondage.  Then the Greek received
it from the Hebrew; and the Latin from the Greek; and the English
from the Latin.
So the "primitive history" should be very deeply respected for
the truthfulness it has preserved in thle relation of oriental tradition,
mythology, and theology, considering that it has been transferred from
one generation to another; that some passages have been altered and
others expunged; that there has been some imperfect compilation,
and that so many interested persons have been engaged in handing
it down in the manner described, to the subsequent generations'
D 93. It should be distinctly understood that we have now ascended in the hagaographical and archaeological history of the early tribes
of mankind to the period of an event in the physical history of the
"By "Germanic tribes," the author means those original tribes some or all of
which subsequently emigrated to, and peopled, Germany.

earth known as the flood or deluge.  I have described the primitive
ideas of the inhabitants of southern Europe and of South America,
with their ascending modifications.  I have also given a view of the
condition and progress of the early tribes of the Asiatic and African
continents, which in their advancement established a different theology
from that of other nations.  They conceived of no new and important
mythological opinions after the establishment of those of which I have
spoken.  And so things remained until occurred the plhysical transformation termed the deluge.
This term is taken firom the Latin diluvio, to overflow, and diluvium, an inundation.  It becomes necessary to glance at the various
impressions which this rnighty occurrence produced upon the minds
of mankind.
By those who depend upon superficial history for their knowledge,
the deluge is believed to have been a universal submersion of the
face of creation.  Many have employed the same noble powers and
faculties to promulgate this misconception as should be employed if
it were divine truth.  But the reason is plain to every person who
possesses interior perception and discernment, why such men have
through all ages, down to the present time, depended for their faith
upon superficial evidence, and in such reposed the deepest confidence.  Therefore such noble and well-meaning minds should be
beloved and gently treated: for they are only the subjects of Tmisconlception; and in the theories they have imbibed they leave become
highly enlightened.
But there is another class of minds, who, having become dissatisfied with early impressions and unreal philosophy, have discarded
them, and proceeded to investigate the natural operations of all physical laws and principles of the Universe. These minds have discovered, according to the divine and ever-unchanging teachings of these
principles, that a universial inundation was a physical impossibility:
because the atmospheric envelope would not sustain watery vapor in
sufficient quantity to cover the whole earth on its becoming condensed.
Geological investigations also unfold evidence against such a possibility.  Besides, there is no substantial reason why a universal
deluge should occur.  It would be unreasonable to suppose that!
Nature has put forth her efforts to produce the highest type of physical organization, which is Man, and this, too, by the operations of
her immutable laws, her living, divine Essence, and by her un,

changing obedience to the Great Positive MIind-and then, after
having created all things, swept them  out of existence.  For man is
not accountable, in a manner in which this supposition would imply,
for his original or present imperfections; for these sprang necessarily
from his uncultivated social and moral situation.  Indeed, it is only
by the aid of this imperfection that man can properly know and appreciate purity and perfection.  So this imperfection is an indisprtlsable use to the inhabitants of the earth at the present period, vwhereby
they may obtain instruction, and be induced to press onwvard to the
organization of a more truthful physical condition, and to the attainment of a higher spirituality.
So physical and moral evidences are against the possibility of a
universal inundation.  And minds properly constituted and directed
will repose entire confidence in these immutable teachings of Nature,
of the Universe, of the Divine Mind.
Yet those who have been educated to believe otherwise hiave opposed the promulgation of these evidences with as much vel-hemence
as they have manifested in the dissemination of their own views.
Men who are thus instructed from  youth, imbibe hereditarily the
opinions of their forefathers, and venerate them  because they were
the first upon the mind-which circumstance produces in the mind
a conviction of their truthfulness.  Such minds should be admired
for all the noble qualities and faculties which they possess: but if
those faculties are compassed about by a wall of prejudice and sectarian affection, then evidence should be presented appealing to their
more interior and unsophisticated qualities; and then their minds
would become expanded and free from all bigotry, superstition, and
unnatural prejudice.  Make men love truth by causing their inc'ests
to correspond to truth, and then truth will be received by a natural
influx firom their superior situation.  But leave men inferiorly conditioned as to their social and external affairs, and all their opinions
wvill corresponrl precisely to the inferior state in which they are existing.
So men should not criticise each other's thoughts wvitl a superficial
judgment; but instead of this, they should present truth in all its native simplicity, and leave error and all the depressing influences existing in the physical and mental world to themselves: for the best
antidote for error is the presentation of truth.  Marvel not, tlhen, concerning the superficial things of which I have spoken, nor falsely
accuse each other's sentiments.  Instead of this, respect the affection

for thoughts, flow these from whatsoever mind they may; but do not
anibibe those thoughts or sentiments unless they are truthful, and
congenial with the deepest interior promptings of the living principle within.
~ 94. Before I proceed to speak of the origin of the opinion concerning the universality of the flood, I will speak of the flood itself,
in connexion with what has already been said on the same subject.
In previous remarks upon the formation of tile Pacific ocean, Caribbean sea, gulf of Mexico, and Guatemala-also on the confirmation of the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters in their present forms
-I spoke of the valley which now forms the bed of the Pacific
ocean; of the inhabitants of those portions now known as the Sandwich and Philippine islands; and also of those of the fertile portions
now known as the West-India islands, of the portion which now
forms the Mexican gulf, and of the extent of the tribes into the inland
fertile locations.  I have in general terms described how these portions became populated; and a more particular relation is not necessary.  Keeping in memory, then, all the conditions of which I have
previously spoken, I proceed to some general considerations concerning the phenomenon, cause, and result of the deluge which was
at this period about transpiring.
It is unnecessary here to explain tile primary physical causes engaged in producing this awful catastrophe: I have before spoken at
length concerning the transformation of particles of inferior substances
into the watery element and into the atmosphere, and of the equilibriumn between the external and internal portions of the earth.  I have
also spoken of the stupendous icebergs that were fornned in the arctic
regions.  And I have intimated that the upper portions of the two
hemispheres were as yet concealed by the water, because the land
there was lowver than at any other portion of the earth, with the exception of the beds of the Atlantic and Mediterranean which then
were partly formed, according to the level-seeking tendency of the
watery element.  So about these things I relate no more.
It was by the loss of the equilibrium between the interior and exterior forces that the molten contents of the centre of the earth became excited in an inconceivable manner.  And as was the case in
previous instances, the Andes, Vesuvius, and the many other relieving vents, were inadequate now to restore the equilibrium.  So the
voice of the earthquake thundered through the bowels of the earth.





## p. 394 (#422) ############################################


394            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
It was mightier than the mightiest earthquake, and louder than the
loudest thunder.  It burst forth, and the earth trembled to its centre.
Fire, smoke, mist, and rain, surrounded the whole earth.  Tile tribes
that were existing on the portions intermediate between what are now
called the eastern and western hemispheres were nearly all destroyed;
and those that survived fell stupified, as if dead, to the ground.
Thouglt can not clothe itself in words sufficiently expressive to describe the sufferings and exclamations of the inhabitants.  And about
three days elapsed before the equilibrium was restored — at the end of
which time the northern portions being elevated, and other portions
depressed, the water rushed from  the former regions and filled valleys which had previously been dry land, and the oceans, seas, lakes,
gulfs, and rivers, became established as existing at the present day.
I am now impressed to notice the surviving inhabitants, and the
effect which this great occurrence produced upon their minds.
Th'lie tribe which remained up to this time in the valley of Shinar,
together with five small, detached tribes, were destroyed: but those
that separated from the former, and located in China and Japan, remained unharmed.  They retained the theology and doctrines taught
them by the chieftain of whom I have spoken. And I will proceed
to notice the effect which this event produced upon them. and the
interpretation of the occurrence as given by their head and ruler.
Soon after all things became quiet, they sent messengers to ascertain how it had fared with their elder brethren in the vallpy of Shinar.
But discovering them not, and seeing a river where once they had
lived, they returned and related this to their governor.  And as they
knew of no other nations existing upon the earth, they concluded
that they were the only people saved from the great catastrophe.  So
the chief began to instruct them that as the others had not been good,
and had not offered sacrifices to satisfy the demands of Brahma"Brahma seeing that the wickedness upon the earth was great, and
the imaginations of the thoughts of their hearts were only evil continually, began to repent that he had directed Vishnu to create their
forefathers and them.  And seeing that the earth was filled with wickedness and abomination in the sight of Brahma, he said he would
cause the great waters, of which he had made the ground and them,
to sweep them off the face of the land."
So the governor and prophet of this eastern tribe gave the impres
sion that it was because he himself, and his tribe, were better than
their forefathers, that Brahma let them  live.  He represented these





## p. 395 (#423) ############################################


nlATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                395
ideas by sounds and hieroglyphics.  He instructed them to build a
brazen image that would represent, as he said, the god of the Sun.
Tile head of this being was very much like that of the unicorn, and
the body like that of a fish; and they placed it within a stone tent,
and every year visited it and offered up sacrifices.  To this they
were prompted because they had been preserved. And from this
time they began to worship the sun, the moon, the stars, and the
milky way, which they supposed were the habitations of spirits, the
number of which they represented as being thirty-three thousand,
each one of these being a god to its respective sphere or planet.
They as yet did not designate each other by names, but merely by
families or states of association.  But the person who was their governor and prophet, yet unnamed, was, by subsequent writers, named
Fohi. This may be verified in the Chinese record of the present
day.  And this person has been supposed by still more modern
writers to be the Noah spoken of in the " primitive history."
The Chaldeanic Persians, or the Japan tribe of which I have
spoken, preserved in their mythology the whole account, with very
little modification.  But the father of the fanlily who was permitted
to live by Brahma, they named Xisutlhlrus.  This also has been supposed by modern historians to be the person named in the Jewish
account of the deluge.
Tile sects known as the Budhists and Jaina preserved with great
care the same traditional account, and the same ultimately became a
portion of the Greek oriental history and theology: and in this the
same being is named Deucalion.  This is the termination of the tradition concerning the deluge as the account and interpretation of it
were given by the leader of the eastern isolated tribe of which we
lhave spoken.
~ 95. I now  proceed to speak of the aborignal inhabitants of
America, and of the effect produced upon their minds by the same
catastrophe.
By the formation of the Pacific ocean they were separated from,
and lost all communication with, the tribes that were existing upon
the present Sandwich islands: and they knew not of the tribes and
nations in the southern continent.  And there were but few Indians
who escaped the inundation, which was by them supposed to be universal; for they dwelt more upon the portions now covered by the
Pacific than they did east of the present limits of that ocean.  So





## p. 396 (#424) ############################################


396            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
they believed that they were the only tribes that were saved, and that
they dwelt upon the only land in the earth, supposing that all other
portions had sunk beneath the great waters.
And now I have occasion to speak of their original conceptions of
tile Great Spirit.
They were unlike their brethren in disposition and social condition; for they were united by a well-directed affection, and by a unity
and harmony in all their plans and proceedings.  They were exceedingly fond of hunting, and this employment they supposed was right,
or else their forefathers who followed it would not have dwelt in such
a beautiful garden.  So they invented instruments, and cultivated
the disposition to roam and hunt through the wilds of the forest, and
would pitch their bark tents wherever they pleased.
Being thus socially united, they were not led to conceive of gross
errors: for errors spring from social disunity and disorganization, and
from a misapprehension of the cause of existing evil.  Having imbibed and retained the impression received by their early forefathers,
they proceeded to reconcile this impression with the manifestation of
all things about and above them.  So they saw that the "breaths"
were not evil to them as their fathers had taught, but instead of this
they supposed that they proceeded from a good spirit, who desired
to fan their heated brows after they had toiled and travelled excessively in the light of the Good Spirit.  So when fatigued and exhausted by toilsome travels, they would rest confidingly under the
protection of the Great Spirit who had formed their world, and would
joyously receive his refreshing breath, that carne, as they supposed,
from some of the good subordinate spirits.  They saw that these
" breaths" were generally good for them; and this manifestation of
goodness unfolded the tender dispositions of their nature, and they
dwelt in love one with another.  And these truthful conceptions, and
their tranquillizing influences, descended through all the succeeding
generations of this people down to the present time.
They believed that the eye, the tongue-that plants, animals, and
all the celestial orbs —had spirits in attendance.  They believed that
the power of speaking was communicated to them by the spirit of the
tongue, and so also the power of seeing by the spirit of the eye
They loved, adored, and worshipped, the Sun: for it made their
earth fertile in all the things which they cultivated.  They wmo
shipped the Moon: for it was a good spirit to give them light while
the warm and better spirit had gone to rest.  They beheld the stars





## p. 397 (#425) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 397
with awe and admiration: because they were little lights held out by
the good spirits to give them light, and to make their earth look beautiful when the sun and the moon had retired to rest.  They believed
that when they should lie down and die, the spirit of their eyes and
tongue would convey the spirit that was within them to the beautiful
habitations of the spirit-land.  They felt conscious that the spiritland was analogous to the one on which they dwelt, in all its productions, so that there they might hunt, adore the good spirits, and
love one another; and it was therefore to them a land of transcendent
beauty and grandeur.  There they would not see any more the
spirit of the waters.  And there they would not die any more, neither dislike nor injure one another; but would be near the placid
waters, and the meandering streamns, and in the forests and gardens
of beauty and delight.  Tlere they would see the shining fish, the
gilded birds, and the gentle animals, that would not resist their grasp.
There they would behold the Good Spirit, while the vaulted chambers above would be illuminated by all the grandeur and magnificence
possible to conceive.
This truthfull conception and its accompanying influences became
established immoveably in the minds and affections of each succeeding generation down to the present time.  Here is the first instance,
firom the moment the human form first obtained an existence, in which
human thought took a proper, truthful, and natural direction.  It was
the spontaneous teaching of Nature about them, and the corresponding prompting of the principle within, that taught them of the spiritland.  Disunity was not in their midst; and therefore wickedness
and abomination were to them unknown.  Their thoughts were natural, spontaneous, true, and celestial.  Learn from  this, ye men of
erudition, and let your lofty aspirations sink to the lowest degree of
abasement.  Learn firom this, ye theologians, philosophers, and meta
physicians, and let your now-ambitious thoughlts sink so low that
generations yet unborn will be unconscious of their existence. Learn
from this, ye traditional historians, ye governors, chieftains, prophets,
and potentates, and promptly discard all that has been and begin
again, and travel the path of wisdom and virtue.  Learn fiom this,
ye classifiers, ye commentators, ye external and unnatural teachers,
and let the ink which has been wasted in penning your thoughts be
naught in comparison to the abundance of tears shed by you in the
act of humiliation!  Let external pride and consequent arrogance
fall for ever.  Let lilghmindedness and pretended enlightenment

cease to trammel your spiritual principle, and let this then seek true
wisdom, derivable firom the inexpressible beauties of a smiling NATURE!
The Indians supposed that none but themselves were preserved
upon the earth; and they believed that the spirit of the great waters
had swallowed up their brethren because of their wickedness, and
left them because they were good, and favored in the sight of the
Good Spirit.  They named the chief existing among themt at the
time of this occurrence Sottavarata.  This tradition, with a very
little modification, has descended through the minds of every subsequent generation.  And this person has been supposed by some
modern chronological and biblical writers to be the Noah of the
" primitive history."
I will now proceed to speak of the nation and collateral tribes that
dwelt in Central America and southern Europe.  Inasmuch as they
had advanced more in all the arts and sciences than any other nation,
their language and theology were necessarily more sublime. I am
now speaking of the fleeting, evanescent sublimity that is always connected with an unreal idealism.  It will be remembered that they had
removed the origin of evil to an abyss below, of which the sun was
a representative: but it now became necessary for their inspired
chieftain to interpret and account for this wonderful catastrophe by
the theological materials in his possession. I am now speaking of a
chieftain who superseded the one of whom I last spoke. He said
(as the inhabitants of the city wherein they dwelt were the only ones
known to be preserved, with the exception of three tribes that dwelt
on thile more inland portions) that the angry being who had made that
great fiery gulf was exasperated because of the short-coming and
wicked transactions of their brethren, the tribes that dwelt upon the
gulf of Mexico and other portions leading to the West-India islands.
And he said this angry being had conversed with their previous governor, for the sake of whose presence the tribes had long been saved
And as he was the only good person among all the tribes, he was
permitted to converse with the spirit who was opposed to these
abominations.  And he entered into a covenant with this angry being (for the latter lamented that he had created so many tribes) to let
that tribe and himself live, because it was necessary that the earth
should be peopled by those who were as good as lie and they were.
So one of their vortical edifices contained the hieroglyphical promise





## p. 399 (#427) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 399
or covenant made with the potentate of whlom I have spoken, and
which was confirmed by the one of whom. I am now speaking.  It
is well to remark that I am now speaking of a chieftain who taught
and established the traditions of three generations before him-the
one living when occurred the deluge.  For the theology was not
definitely confirmed and promulgated until the third generation after
the occurrence.  But this vortical edifice contained hieroglyphical
representations which the then-present chieftain interpreted into a
demonstration that the forefather had conversed with the angry being.
And it was owing to this, he taught, that they were saved; while
their brethren, who were wicked in the sight of their god, descended
into the burning realms below.  I will now trace this idea until it
makes its appearance in modern days.
It will be remembered that this nation believed that they were the
only human beings saved, because they knew not of any other inliabitants-and believed that their god had repented of making so many
tribes, because of their wickedness, and destroyed them on that account. The chieftain who transferred this traditional account from
the time of the deluge, was not named until many generations after
him.  And I find no absolute trace of a name until I trace these
ideas into the manuscripts of which I have spoken, in the Jews' possession: and there he is named Noah.
I have thus traced the Chinese mythology to the Greek —and the
mythology of these southern tribes to the Jews; and I find the accounts in this manner: The good, saved, and favored, of the Chinese,
were Fohi and his family; of the Chaldeanic-Persians, Xisuthrus and
his family; of the Greeks, Deucalion and his family.  In the Indian
mythology, the saved were Sottavarlata and his family: and each
believed that the whole world was drowned, with the exception of
themselves.  In the Jews' manuscripts, I find that the saved were
Noah and his family.
And in the writings of modern commentators upon oriental and
heathen mythology, these various traditions are generally referred to,
to establish the truthfulness of the relation as contained in the " primtive history" — it being supposed that the account in the possession:f each nation originated from one source, and from the actual, traditional experience of a man and family as is therein related.  Such
a supposition is not warrantable; for all the traditions that are in
possession of the different nations can not be traced to one source.
In the Jewish record, the general account is as follows: "And





## p. 400 (#428) ############################################


400            NATURE'S DIVINE,REVELATIONS..he wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and the imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And God repented that he had peopled the earth; —but Noah found favor in his
sight."  And the latter was directed to construct an ark of gopherwood, with specific and required dimensions: and Noah and his
family, and the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of the air, entered,
sexually conjoined, into the ark, and were saved.  After this, dry
land appeared, as Noah inferred from evidence conveyed by a dove.
And soon the ark rested upon Mount Ararat, and the animals therein
contained went forth to multiply and reanimate the face of Nature;
and Noah and his family went forth to multiply, and to populate the
whole earth.
In the Chinese mythology, or rather in that of the more recent
tribes of that nation, the following account may be found: "And
Brahma seeing the wickedness of the forefathers, did lament because
they did not sacrifice their offerings, and began to lament that he had
directed Vishnu and Narasayana to awake them from the depths of
the great waters. But Fohi could speak with Brahma because of
his goodness.  And he directed Fohi to journey to that high land
and live.  Then Vishnu broke up the bottom of the great deep, and
opened the places above: and the great waters covered all the land,
together with our forefathers, who were taken by the evil spirits."
I have related the mythology of the southern tribes, together With
the modification of the Chinese into the Chaldeanic-Persian and
Greek. And the impression that was conveyed to the early Jewish
tribes, and the account contained in the Persian tradition, were blended together; and being afterward written and re-written, compiled
and re-compiled, through the successive languages, it has appeared
in the English version as it may be found by perusing the " primitive
history."  The account is well preserved, considering the innurnerable contingencies which govern all circumstantial things.  And it
is only an exaggerated and poetical representation of that which is
substantially true: and for its truth the history demands the highest
respect.
~ 96. I am impressed to proceed to another class of ideas and tc
speak of their origin and successive modifications until they appear ic
their present form.  The first of these may be found in the early manuscripts of the " primitive history," clothed in the following words:
" And God said, Let us make man in ouR own inmage and likeness."

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 401
In establishing a superficial interpretation of this subject, many
noble and highly-cultivated intellects have been engaged.  Time,
talents, and wealth, have been employed in disseminating such superficial opinions, sufficient to have instructed and cultivated the
moral and intellectual powers of many a nation. The desires and
prejudices of men have warred against the promptings of their judgment, and have circumscribed the range of their own and others'
reasoning powers to the limited circle of a sectarian and hereditary
belief.  In endeavoring to establish preconceived opinions, men have
severed the affectionate ties of congeniality, which should unite mankind as one vast brotherhood; and they have established a deepseated impression that only breathes sectarian contention and local
hostility. They have not proceeded to investigate the interior origin
of thoughts, of which words are merely sheaths; but they have presumed upon the divineness of the sheathings themselves, and warred
against the teachings of judgment, of Nature, and of her Author!
But let the mind search well into the cause of thoughts, and thein
it will be able to judge of the external clothing of these, whether it
be of man, or of that Divine Principle which speaks only by manifesting, at a single expression, millions of systems, decked with life,
beauty, and grandeur!  Let it search well into the internal real reality of all things: and if qualities and principles are found that. are
good, divine, and indestructible, then such will be approbated by the
judgment, and Nature will seal their truth with hler universal concurrences.
I am deeply impressed that volume after volume has been written
upon this and similar subjects, without producing the least relief to a
depressed and ignorant world.  Thoughts like unto the ones, under
consideration, clothed in words, have occupied the attention of an
innumerable host of theological writers.  Their labori time, and talents, have thus been employed in building upon a superficial foundation a theological superstructure which has not in the least degree
ameliorated. the unhappy social and national condition of mankind
their brethren!  The many theories of this nature that are in the
world are external, interruptive, and unholy invasions upon the human affections and judgment.  They are unprofitable and injurious
to the race; they are local, isolated, sectarian, and entirely opposed
to, the highest good of every living creature.  They are unreal, irmpure, wicked.  They are corrupting and vitiating to all the pure affections of ma~n's nature.'They are the foundation of universal

sectarian hostility and superstition.  They are at war with all the
pure, social, and moral interests of man, that would, if undisturbed,
join in one the whole race of intelligent beings.  In the promulgation of these external and evanescent thoughts, the physical world
has been left uncared for, and still remains a comparative wilderness.
If those men who have been thus engaged had been employed according to the design and intention of an unchangeable Governor,
the uninhabited deserts would have been rendered fertile, blooming,
and filagrant; and then would their talents and powers have been appreciated. And then the peace and unity of feeling which would
lhave pervaded the whole race of mankind, would have spoken to
them with a voice of thankfulness, and great would have been their
reward.
The tribes that had become consociated in the valley of Shinar,
according to previous description, received the early impression of
their forefathers concerning the creation, and also the improvements
that were made upon it by their supposed inspired chieftain. In his cosmogony, he called to his assistance from the depths of the water, the
deity of whom I have spoken, subsequently named Parama, Vishnu,
and Siva.  This chieftain first conceived of an original spirit.  This
conception suggested the idea of a second spirit; and this of a'third.
The first he supposed to be the great good spirit that had reposed
from the remotest period of eternity to the time of the creation, in the
bosom of the great waters.  And he conceived that as this spirit
awoke to activity, he breathed forth another spirit to do the work
whilich he (Parama) had designed.  Vishnu was the subordinate spirit
thus created; and he was, according to the chieftain, a part of Parama's soul.  He moved the waters, and continued to do so until he
-created, from the superior materials of the egg, the earth and man.
Then lie supposed that the spirit Siva was the cause of those
~" breaths" which inspired the bosoms of themselves and their elder,brethren With envy, hatred, and deception.  Here, then, originated
ithe thought which has clothed itself in the word TRINITY.
I do not discover any essential change in this part of the oriental.mythology for many centuries; and it ultimately fell into the possession of the Persianic tribes, who preserved it until Zoroaster sys-lematized it and other existing traditions, in his Zend Avesta.  He.changed the deities into the characters of Ormuzd, Atnshaspands,,and inferior spirits.  Thus lie formed from the three, a trinity of





## p. 403 (#431) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  403
good, celestial, and holy spirits, among which  Ormuzd  was supreme.
Seeing so much evil and wretchedness among the inhabitants of
the earth, and seeing war, persecution, and tyranny, existing, he began to reason upon their causes.  And this suggested to his mind a
corresponding trinity of infernal spirits.  The greatest of these was
Ahriman; and he was attended by subordinate and inferior spirits,
and millions of dccers.
Thus Zoroaster presented the trinity in a new form; and from
this it was transplanted into the Jewish manuscripts, in the brief and
comprehensive expression which reads, "And God said, Let us
make man in OUR Own image."  It was also subsequently expressed,
" Father, Son, and Spirit."  The expression, " Let us make man,"
is derived from  the early myth in which the "bus" means Brahma,
Vishnu or Narasayana, and Siva.  It corresponds also to the Greater,
the Lesser, and the Least; Father, Son, and Spirit; Ormuzd, Amshaspands, and superior subordinates.
In the original conception, the characters were distinct and singular; but they were classified and divided by Zoroaster into plurals.
And they were comprehensively expressed in the primitive, Jewish
transcript, according to the original conception.
~ 97. But it is given me to know through the medium of superior
impressions that the expression, " in our imnage and likeness," does
really shadow forth a substantial and truthful idea, verified in the
natural and spiritual spheres.  The terms "image and likeness" have
suggested to a most exalted intellect* a conception in which, after
spiritual research and investigation, he became confirmed; and the
general features of his impressions were correct.  This will appear
as I proceed to a comprehension of the spiritual spheres-fromn
which, I am deeply impressed, flowed high and truthfiul impressions
into the expanded internal of this Swedish philosopher.  But it is
impossible to find in these words, as originally employed in the
"primitive history," one particle of spiritual signification.  It is not
true that he, with all his enlightenment, unfolded an interior truth as
expressed in these primitive sayings.  Instead of this, he unfolded a
stupendous correspondence-not from their interior, but from their
external suggestions. And it is now demonstrated by the unreal
external of things, which he so deeply opposed, that these primitive
Swedenborg.

records do not contain, as divinely originated, a minute spiritual
mneaning or application.  It is absolutely demonstrated in his philosophical and analytical investigations, that externals are the mere superficial and evanescent indications of the interior, and therefore are
to be regarded only as the deceptive garments or sheathings of truths.
Therefore to give an internal signification to a passage which the exernal of the same does not indicate, is indeed to fabricate that which
is unreal and absolutely unprofitable.  The external of the written
record, when viewed by a purely spiritually-exalted intellect, shows
not the least indication of a spiritual signification.  And if the external gives evidence of the interior, why endeavor to give to a passage
a different signification from that which the external manifests?
The external clothing of the " primitive history" interprets its own
internal signification.  It professes to be a truthful and comprehensive history of opinions concerning creation before the flood, and of
the customs, manners, dispositions, and movements, of subsequent
nations; of the repopulation of the earth, and the distribution of tile
early tribes; of their leaders, chieftains, prophets, kings, and emperors. It professes to give the history of wars; of the subjugation
and captivity of tribes; of the upbuilding and downfall of kingdoms
and empires; of the vice, misery, and imaginations, of many nations
of the earth.  These things are therein recorded in the usual style
of the early writers, the forms of expression employed being such as
were adapted to the education of the early inhabitants of the earth.
It professes to be this; its external proves its profession, and its interior is its own expositor.  If more is professed, then such profession has arisen from its promulgators, and is not in accordance with its
own intentions. So while I am deeply impressed to venerate the truthfulness of those historical traditions, I am at the same time impressed
totexpose and discard all untrue theological interpretations, and all
unreal and unholy pretensions.  Things of this nature should be loved
according to the truthfulness of their professions, and not according
to the misinterpretations of their pretensions, such as have clothed
those simple mythological and primitive writings with a mysterious
and impenetrable garment.
The next in the class of ideas the origin of which is to be traced,
is the traditional opinion concerning Cain and Abel. It will be rec
ollected that I have spoken comprehensively concerning the branch
tribes as the offspring of the early family, and have related that one

conquered and destroyed the other-the triumphant nation subsequently journeying to the European continent.  The history of this
was transferred, with other and similar impressions, through successive generations and centuries, until we find it first expressed by a
writer anmong the early Egyptians. A correspondence was connected with this tradition, which was of the following import (for the
early inhabitants knew things by their obvious correspondences and
representatives): Thle younger and weaker tribe (which was Abel)
correspon:led to light, purity, and innocence.  Cain (which was
~he stronger and grosser nation) corresponded to darkness, wickedness, and abomination.  For, according to the early theology,
darkness was the first principle in being, and therefore was the oldest
and most powerful; while light was subsequently created, and was
consequently weak and unmatured.  And thus the comparison waswritten among the Egyptians as follows:-'" And from the forefathers sprang two children, whose names were
Osiris and Typhon.  Osiris was a good and gentle brother, and was
loved by Brahmtna.  Typhon was a strong brother, and cultivated the
things of the earth.  For Typhon is the child of darkness which was
over all and for ever: but Osiris was a child of light, because light
was permitted by Vishnu the good spirit."  But Typhon, which is
darkness, was represented as attacking and overpowering Osiris,
which is light and innocence.  This is the first written correspondential account of this primitive tradition.
I find that this was admitted into other manuscripts, and appeared
among the Chaldeanic writings. Afterward it was transcribed into
Greek, and ultimately into the Hebrew oracles and manuscripts; a'nd
thr6ugh this medium it was conveyed to subsequent generations wh'i
admitted it into the " primitive history:" an& inthis the characters are
nanied Cain and Abel.
~ 98. The next idea to be analyzed and traced to its origin is
concerning the seven days that are represented as elapsing during the
formation of the earth and all things therein, the seventh day being
spoken of as smiling on the consummation: of the grand work:, and
giving rest to Brahma, who blessed it.
Many centuries elapsed before the early inhabitants began to make
astronomical observations.  But from  the indications of the winds,
atmosphere, heat, light, sun, moon, stars, and all visible objects which
were supposed to be gods, they at length began to learn to enumerate,





## p. 406 (#434) ############################################


406            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
to determine upon the seasons, to know their approach, and also to
know when to visit one another.  The first inhabitants knew well
when to expect darkness, by the periodical recession of the sun behind the western lands.  They also knew when to expect light, by
the illumination of the eastern hills.  They were uncertain for a time
whether these things would continue so or not; but they were soon
confirmed in the opinion that they would continue, by the unvarying
appearance and disappearance of the sun. Hence they made one of
the first detached tribes to represent darkness, and the other light.
So far, then, they had advanced in astronomical knowledge —they
knew the periodicity of days and nights.
But they could as yet only perceive general correspondences, and
these they represented in hieroglyphical characters.  And so they'
continued for several centuries, until they discovered a new and valuable truth-that the moon was made and destroyed twelve times
whlile the sun was passing once through the circle of the zodiac.  This
established in their minds the first idea of a year with its subdivisions.
And they had a god constructed to represent, and to correspond
precisely to, this occurrence: and at the end and beginning of this
period they had great festivities, and offered up to the god of the
year innumerable sacrifices.
The twelve periods of the moon's destruction and reproduction
corresponded to months-though these divisions were the work of
generations subsequent to the discovery of the year.  And thus they
continued for many seasons, until their faculties of discernment became improved and they discovered that the moon was large, diminished, half destroyed, nearly destroyed, entirely annihilated, at regular periods, which were afterward found to be just seven days and
nine hours.  But the hours were unnoticed, as they could only distinguish bold numerals.  This gave the conception of weeks; and
thus this division of time became established among the Egyptians,
Chinese, Persians, and Jews.
Succeeding generations reduced weeks to days, because there
were seven of these in one of the periods of the moon's transition.
Days became classified into hours, by the changing shadow of an immoveaole object situated in the light of the sun.  In this manner,
years, months, weeks, days, and hours, became established.
And Sunday is a name of more recent date, and was instituted by
the Danes, adopted by the Saxons, and transplanted to the English
language.  In the Saxon, the word was Sunnedag: sunne signifying





## p. 407 (#435) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                407
the sun, and dag signifying day.  In the Danish, it is written Soncdag, meaning day of the sun.  And this was applied to the first day
of the changed moon, in glorification of the sun.  And the next day,
the moon having advanced, was called Moon's-day-it being a day
attributed to the moon.  And Tuesday received its name from the
god Tuisco; and Wednesday from the god Wednos; and Thursday
from the god Tthursco: and the remaining days were in like manner
allegorically named.
In a similar manner the division of days became introduced into
the Jewish historical writings -whlere the days were only designated
by the phrase, " the evening and tile morning."  And as the seventh
day was the last, or the great Sun-day, it was looked upon by the
Jews as being of divine origin.  And they imbibed the impression
that the light on that day was peculiarly pure and serene.  So six
days were observed as times for labor, and the seventh was appropriated to rest- as had reposed the good spirit Parama, after lie had
finished the creation of the world and man, according to oriental
mythology.
But I was impressed in describing the geological epochs of the
creation of the globe, and of the plants and animals, to use the expression " evening and morning," &c., because the correspondence
between the expression and the physical reality was complete.
In the manner above related, the inhabitants in all early and subsequent ages made the starry heavens their field of observation; and
they received, from  it unfailing instruction and wisdom, which imbodied itself in the language of correspondences.
So likewise has the system  of enumeration become established.
All nations and tribes upon the face of the earth manifest a sameness
in their rules of counting, their highest number of the unit series
never exceeding ten.  The reason Why this became so general and
confirmed among all nations is manifest: for it appears that the early
tribes counted their fingers, which were for a long titme their only
arithmetic.  And the same rule being subsequently recognised in the
written records of all nations, formed the established mode of enumeration among all, and is perfectly universally recognised by the
nations of the present day.
~ 99. The next idea in the class before mentioned is that of the
origin of language as intimated in the. mytliological traditioll con.





## p. 408 (#436) ############################################


408             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
tained in the "primitive history," that " the whole earth was oi one
language and of one speech."*
When the early family perceived that they possessed the power
of vocal communication, and began to convey their thoughts to one
another through that medium, they supposed that this power was
given to them by the " breaths," and that therefore it should be used
and cultivated.  But succeeding generations, discovering that this
faculty had produced a disunion among their forefathers, believed,
according to the tradition transmitted from their previous brethren,
that the " breaths" were evil spirits, and had given to the world one
language and one speech so that they might deceive and dislike one
another.  This was the prevailing opinion for many ages, both before and after the deluge, and among all the tribes of the earth.  All
admitted this as a part of their sacred theology, because it was told
by their forefathers, and was confirmed by the sacredness which their
winds associated with its age.
This opinion continued to prevail until they had gained, fromn hieroglyphics and terrestrial and astronomical correspondences, instruction sufficient to enable them, according to previous description, to
construct a language which  was the parent of the subsequent Sanscrit.
At this time they used the soft bark of trees, and palm-tree leaves,
as materials whereon to impress. in this language, their thoughts.
This art continued in this condition for a long period, and meanwhile was mostly in possession of governors, chieftains, and lawgivers, who believed and taught, according to early impression, that
their language was of divine origin.
I find the next development of this idea (which is strictly mythological) among the Chinese, Chaldeans, Brahmins, and other Hindostanic tribes.  They believe that the Vedas and B'rahinanas in:
their possession are sacred oracles, written by celestial beings in divine language: and these collectively are known as the Shaster.t
The Vedas compose- the first part of the Shaster —which signifies.
and represents lilfe, light, truth, fire, wit, law, ordinance, and celestial
knowledge.  And the Brahmanas are the second part, and are com —
posed of Orphic hymns, which they believe to be heavenly, and
which are like the poetical songs of the early Egyptian tribes.  These
they would sing to the deities, raising their voices in thanksgiving
and praise to the great and good spirit who had formed the Sanscrit

language. For a clearer idea of the character of these Orphic hymns.
it would be well to read the Psalms, and the book of Job, as these
were an imitation of the Orphic hymns of the Shaster, which were in
manuscript among the Egyptians and Chaldeanic-Persians.  The
early Hindostanic tribes believed that their language was given to
Brama* from  heaven, by the Deity: and hence their supposition
that the Shaster, which is composed of the Vedas and Brahmanas,
was an emanation from  heavenly spheres, and was -an embodiment
of the thoughts of the celestial beings.
For many continuous ages, the Sanscrit was the most perfect language known among mankind.  Being so nearly perfected by earlier
generations, it was afterward improved, cultivated, and rendered copious, by successive chieftains, and finally it was perfected by Brama
their lawgiver and holy prophet, who was supposed to hold intercourse
with the deities.
A further development of this theological tradition is found: among
the Persians.  I am  obliged to pass over many centuries, during
which time other tribes migrated from  the southern portions of the
earth into Asia and Africa, bringing, with them  a different mode of
expression.  For the Chaldean or Persian language is from  a root'
consisting of a different form  of speech, and this afterward became
perfected and established by uniting with its rudimental form a dialect of the Sanscrit. And about the tirme this language became thusestablished and confirmed, those who employed it were equally confirmed in the belief that it was of a spiritual origin, according to the
sacred tradition of their forefathers.  Zoroaster now lived, and was
the Persian lawgiver.  He wrote the Zend Avesta, which he said
was a gift from the gods: and the people believed that this was given
to Zoroaster, as the Brahmin: believes of the Shaster, by a communication with the Deity. They supposed that their language originated
inr the same way.
The Jews also believed that the knowledge and direction received;
by Moses, their lawgiver, was directly from the Deity.  So likewise
the followers of M-oharnmmed supposed that the Koran was written in:
celestial spheres by God, and was given to M'ohammed w-hile in acave.
So in giving an opinion concerning the original state of language?
it is said that " the whole earth was of one language and of one

speech.  And it came to pass that as they journeyed from the east,
they discovered a plain in the valley of Shinar, where they dwelt."*
It is well to remark that this is firom  a manuscript the substance of
which sustains a position in the " primitive history" after the relation
of the flood. But the account should not be thus placed, as it relates
a circumstance that occurred beJore the flood some ages.
And I feel deeply impressed that the inhabitants of the earth at
the present day are not generally any better informed concerning the
origin of language than were the early tribes of China, Egypt, and
Hindostan.  For they are believing, like the Brahmin, the Egyptian,
the Chaldean, the Persian, the Jew, and the Greek, that language
was communicated to the forefathers by the Deity himself.  Very
many learned and enlightened men still maintain this heathen and
unadvanced idea.  They can not, because of their early education,
properly conceive of natural and progressive development.  But if
they could only recognise and understand this divine and unchangeable principle of the Universe, they would discard all further belief
in the mythological idea of direct instruction from the Deity.
Instead of exerting your powers to sustain these superficial chimeras, investigate the interior reality of which all natural endowments
and developments are the representatives.  Suspend your preconceived opinions, and ask the more interior and rational element of
your being whether language is of celestial origin, or whether it does
not naturally unfold itself, commencing in a rudimental form in the
animal kihgdom, and being perfectly developed by man?  Consider
whether effects do not always correspond to their interior and inciting
causes; and then deeply consider the question, "If language was an
effect of a celestial cause, and if its origin is divine, should not language be pure, celestial, and undeceptive?"
The nature of the mental and physical constitution of mankind is
divine, perfect, and harmonious.  This never will deceive.  It is
perfectly good, and represents the divineness of its great Origin and
Cause. Deception, however, exists in the world, and all descriptions of dissimulation.  But these things do not flow from the interior of man's nature, but arise merely as a consequence of his unholy,
imperfect, and vitiated situation, in reference to his fellow-beings.
Unholy situations produce unholy effects.  But the interior principle, which is of divine origin, can not be made evil, nor can it be
contaminated. And all evl evil is of external and superficial origin, and
* Genesis xi. 2.





## p. 411 (#439) ############################################

is felt by all as external; and hence, in order to banish evil from the
earth, a change must occur in the social condition of the whole world.
Among other superficial things, language is existing; and as its effects
are manifestly imperfect, it is evident that it must have originated
from a source correspondingly imperfect.
~100. The next idea in the series is tile mythological theory of
the origin' of evil.  I have spoken at length concerning the general
and natural cause of the existence of evil in the world.  But as what
I have said does not correspond with the prevailing theological conception of its origin, it becomes necessary to speak of the early
conception, and to briefly notice its subsequent developments.
The first inhabitants believed that the I breaths" inspired them
with evil thoughts; which suggested and confirmed a belief in the
existence of a malignant deity who was opposed to them, and who
destro.yed their social love and breathed ainong them a spirit of envy,
hatred, and deception.  This conception was modified by the southern tribes, by transferring the origin of evil to the light and warmth
of the atmosphere, and even to the sun itself —and also by conceiving that the sun was the representative of a corresponding fount of
undiminishing fire.  But the idea proceeded no further than this
among these nations.
But the eastern tribes conceived that a spirit was existing between
themn and the good deity, which prevented their having divine commerce.  This belief existed in a similar form among all the tribes of
the east up to the timne of Zoroaster, who established in the world a
belief in two antagonistic, eternal, unconquerable deities: one the
god of evil, and the other the god of goodness.  The throne of each
of these beings was surrounded by subordinate spirits of a character
corresponding to the deity to which they were respectively attached.
So he conceived of an innumerable host of deers, which were associated with the evil deity, and were his agents to disseminate evil
imaginations and unrighteous thoughts and desires in the minds of
all mankind.
The Jewish rabbinical writers are no more fiee from these mytlholooical imaginations: for they adopted the Persianic opinion and put
it forth in their writings.  Hence the origin of the passage in the
" primitive history" which speaks of the appearance of an evil spirit
in the form of a serpent in the garden of Eden, and asserts that the
woman, being gentle and unsophisticated, became deceived therely,





## p. 412 (#440) ############################################

and was induced to partake of the fruit of the tree of evil; that she
transmitted the forbidden fruit to her associate Adam, who, being
equally delighted and enchanted, partook thereof-and that they
were thus both made sinful, whereas before, they were pure and unpolluted.
These rabbins also have conveyed the idea that God planted the
garden of Eden, and made man and placed him there, and then directed him not to eat of the fruit of the tree of evil, without telling
him rthe full consequences which would result from a participation
thereof.  They represented the Deity as placing before the youthful
minds of the first pair an irresistible temptation, without giving them
constitutional strength to resist its captivating influence.  They have
represented the Deity as saying, " In the day thou eatest thereof,
thou shalt surely die," and represented one of the deevs of Zoroaster's infernal deity as contradicting the words of the Divine Being,
saying to them, "Ye shall not surely die."  Notwithstanding the
promises of this evil spirit, they are represented as falling from  a
state of innocence to the depths of evil, from which it is supposed
that the world at the present day has not experienced a resurrection.
They are also represented as being driven out froIn the beautiful
garden and from the Deity's presence, to roam uucared for throughout the wilds of an uncultivated earth. This is a comprehensive
description of the contents of the Zend Avesta of Zoroaster, and
does not much transcend the mythology of the first oriental and
hleathen tribes.
The word diabolos* is only another name for Zoroaster's deevs;
and deevs is another name for "breaths."  In the English version
the same is expressed by the words darkness, death, sin, devil, Satan,
and evil.
It is to be deeply lamented that this simple history of the oriental
mythology has been the foundation of so vast an amount-of improper
theological speculation.  Men have not, investigated the origin of the
ideas, and their internal signification, but have descended into the
foreign languages to ascertain the original application of the mere
words.  And thus the ideas of " temporal death," " moral death,"
and " spiritual death,"' have been recognised in all theological speculation growing out of that simple verse of the traditional account,
which says, "Ye shall not surely die"-and its opposite declaration
by the Deity.

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                413
By a law governing all organized substances, every particle comin
posing these must of necessity undergo a specific change and decomposition. And when matter forms an organization in any department of Nature, that organization is supported and perpetuated by
the law of association, or by a reciprocal change of particles with
other substances.  Therefore the particles which flow into an organization must be extracted and received from other substances, of
which these particles previously formed a part.  And when they enter into the new organization, they receive new life, according to that
contained in the body of which they then become a part. Thus bodies or organizations are incessantly produced, sustained, developed,
and perpetuated, in every department of the Universe.  Therefore
there is no such thing in existence as natural death: for an exchange
of particles from one form of life to another, is nothing more than the
necessary requirement of every organized substance in being.  So
what is called natural death, is not death, but a mere change of organization.  Why have ye not analyzed the interior workings of
Nature and her immutable laws, and from them learned to discard
for ever all chimerical and unnatural theological speculations?  Natural death has been the basis of many a controversy: but now it is
made plain to a demonstration that such discussions were based on
a misapprehension, and were unprofitable, because such a thing as
natural death never occurred in any of the recesses of the great Universe.
I now proceed to speak of moral death. Tile idea of moral death
has arisen from a superficial view of social disunity, and of disunity
of thought and action.  The innate divineness of the spirit of man
prohibits the possibility of spiritual wickedness or unrighteousness.
The desires and affections of the spirit proceed from within and from
without.  Desires spring from the material relation which man sustains to his brother and the Universe.  These desires proceed from
sensation, which creates inclination, which demands gratification.
Then there is another class of desires, which are affections springing
up within and directing and controlling the outer.  These affections
are the elements of the spirit, which desires purity and perfection.
It is the principle within that illuminates the external, whenever any
pure and divine thought or principle is presented for contemplation.
This is the element that recognises goodness, gentleness, and purity;
it is the element of love; it is the immortal principle. Its workings and
effects are the morals and affections of man, and they are immortal

and can not die.  Morality, then, is a consequence of the unchanging
divinity of the spirit, and is as undying as the immutable laws that
govern all subordinate organizations.  " Moral death" is therefore a
manufactured expression, meaning nothing.
Spiritual death is only another form of the latter expression: and
it never had and never can have the least particle of signification.
The word death may be used as corresponding to the conventional
idea of darkness, and the figure is good.  But natural, moral, or spiritual darkness, is impossible: for darkness is an expression presupposing the existence of liglt.  And man has not retrograded from
perfection in his spiritual and natural organization toward the lowest
point of imperfection; for this, again, would be an absolute impossibili~t. Retrogression is a word, like death, having no meaning. Everythling is unfolding life and beauty, according to the law of progressive and eternal development.
Let Nature, then, be heeded as she proclaims her divine instructions, though all artificiality be sacrificed by her omnipotent authority.
Love that which is lovely, and deal gently with that which has been
misdirected'or imperfectly developed.  At the same time, love, adore,
and express the truth, because Truth is a principle which unites and
harmonizes an entire Universe!
(' 101. I now proceed to consider the origin of the ideas concern
ing oracles and prophets, as these are spoken of in the " primitive
history," and understood by the theological writers of modern days.
The reasoning faculties of the early inhabitants were for many
ages uncultivated, undisciplined, and undeveloped; while their powers of imagination and love of the marvellous were highly susceptible
of influence, and consequently became very prolific.  The products
of their imaginations have afforded materials for speculation among
all sacred and theological writers who have bestowed any attention
on mythology.  Their imaginative and conceptive powers were exceedingly susceptible to impressions from, and liable to misconstrue,
all remarkable physical occurrences and manifestations within the
sphere of their observation.  They believed that each external ap
pearance was either a good or bad indication, and that all such appearances were produced by the invisible yet innumerable spirits and
deitids which they believed to be existing. From the time the opinion became established that the " breaths" were evil spirits, they conceived that all other manifestations were ominous of evil, or indicative





## p. 415 (#443) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                415
ofgood. Their imaginative powers, and the rudimental elements of
their judgment, were excited and developed by all things about them;
and their very perfect powers of memory enabled them to form almost
any description or chimerical conception.  Whatever became impressed upon their susceptible imaginations sank deeply into the
recesses of their memory, and from this general source sprang all
traditional mythology.
Thus, among the primitive family, as has been stated, one whose
organization qualified him for the office of a governor and admonisher,
conceived that the cause of the disunity and contention existing among
them was the influence of the evil spirits of the " breaths."  He believed that lhe received this information through the medium  of an
impressive dream. Believing that this was made known to him because he was better and wiser than any other, he promulgated the
same to the pre-impressed minds of the people. He was at once
elevated by his brethren, and was thought to be a person of superior
holiness, holding intercourse with the deities.
Dreaming, then, was believed to be the mediumft of celestial intercourse and communication.  And whoever dreamed an important
dream was called upon to relate the same, and this was then interpreted by their governor.  They also beheld the various objects in
the vegetable and,aniinal kingdoms either as omens of appalling catastrophes or as indications of great good.  And the character of the
omen was always determined by the governor, by inquiring of those
who beheld the animals, in what direction they were going, in what
position they were seen, what were their color, size, general appearance, &c.  The flight of huge birds they believed to portend evil,
and this was to be in accordance with the direction, manner, height,
and distance, of their flight.  So also the internal organs of animals
were supposed to represent various good or evil things that would
ultimately occur.  Also they believed that the clouds, sun, moon,
and stars, were all evident indications, and the things which they represented were decided upon by their chieftain and governor.  Their
reasoning faculties were not employed, and they admitted into their
minds precisely that which was promulgated by their leader. Evrything to them was a correspondence or representation; and by the
means of correspondences and representations, they became acquainted with the thoughts and intentions of one another, and with the interpretations of their governor concerning all physical manifestations.
For many ages this mode of interpretating physical appearances

continued; and it would be proper to consider this as the age of imagination.
After this, in various portions of the earth, men of highly-cultivated
powers discovered that these things were unreal: but they could not
instruct the world concerning this important discovery.  And thus
general ignorance continued to prevail among all the nations of the
earth; and the governor and chieftain of each nation, possessing more
intelligence than the rest, could exert any amount of power and influence over the people.
And at this time, kings were in the habit of having persons who
professed to interpret dreams, as their counsellors; and these persons
were also believed to be in communication with celestial beings, and
enabled thereby to foretell events, and interpret all occurrences.
This was a general custom among the eastern tribes and families;
and they also still retained all the traditional impressions of early
generations.  The persons who claimed to be in possession of these
peculiar powers were not deceiving, but were deceived, concerning
the extent of their knowledge, and the reliableness of their imaginative impressions.
Each king had counsellors, who would prophesy favorably in regard to the prosperity and perpetuation of his kingdom, and the
peace and happiness of his dominions. If there were strong indications of war and hostility, they would indefinitely prophesy concerning the conflict and its termination.  When any of the kings dreamed,
these counsellors or prophets were called to reveal the signification
of his dream.  And they were very indefinite in their interpretations,
but sufficiently distinct to have the generals of their remarks establish
in the minds of those seeking their services, the probability of soonoccurring events.
Subsequently many prophets arose among the Persians, Chinese,
Chaldeans, and Egyptians, who recorded their pretended communications with the deities upon impressible substances, and these were
safely preserved for the sake of their divine and celestial contents.
This state of things continued for many ages, and may properly be
termed the era of oracles.
~ 102. But the world at length became generally more enlightened, and more confirmed as to the unceasing manifestations of Nature.  They therefore began to discard many of their original conceptions, and to exercise their reasoning faculties, which led them to

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                417
a more truthful and exalted conception of the Great Spirit which cre
ated and controls the Universe. At this time some very noble and
expanded minds, availing themselves of the improvements in the art
of writing, reasoned profoundly, and recorded their thoughts; and
their productions afford the first indication of a mental resurrection.
Many Chinese, Egyptian, Persian, and Greek philosophers, conceived and promulgated pure principles of morality, and high and
truthful conceptions concerning the great first and essential Cause
of the Universe-and also believed and taught the doctrine of immortality. These minds were, however, trammelled by early impressions derived from their forefathers, and it was with exceeding
difficulty that they unfettered their faculties and followed their natural
judgments to the extent which their productions indicate.
At the same time, in other portions of the earth, persons were still
existing who pretended to prophesy, and to be divinely instructed.
And it was at this time that the Egyptians and other eastern tribes
discovered the power and art of inducing abnorralness, by various gestures and manipulations.  Persons who were very susceptible of beings
thus influenced, were selected and brought into the presence of the.
king's counsellors, who would affect them physically, and make them
appear as if dead — inducing the sleep which they supposed was necessary in order that they might have direct intercourse with, and
receive advice from, the deities, For they could nlot ahva;ys dream
when they chose: and so in order that a dream mnight be had whenever desired, they would throw these persons into a state corresponding to death, and receive from their lips while in that state the indefiniteexpression of their dreams, which would be interpreted by those
counsellors or prophets, and sent forth as being true and, divine.
This custom continued until they discovered that they were employing these agents to no good purpose.  Foxr the visions and conceptions of the persons in that condition were unreal and; unprofitable,
because these persons were improperly used; and thus the power
and sympathy (which were real) were made the agents of perpetual
deception. Thus dreams, visions, and prophecies, were the agents.
and causes, in early generations, of an immense amount of disunity,,
deception, and wickedness.
I am impressed that some of these oriental prophecies have been
immersed into, and at the present time form a part of, the Primitive,
History.  And it is well to remark that the-urim and thummim:
among the Egyptians was nothing more than a modified rmedium of.

obtaining knowledge of the future, and was thus a means of sustain-.ing those whose lives and talents were spent in the occupation of
prophecy.
All physical manifestations in Nature were understood by the primnitive nations (according to the interpretation given them by their
prophets) to be indications of future occurrences according to the
pleasure or displeasure of the deities.  Not understanding that light
possessed the property of refraction and of resolving itself into different colors when subjected to certain conditions, they conceived that
the rainbow was the expression by the Deity of a promise that the
land should not again be overflown with water. So they looked
upon the rainbow as an unfailing indication and everlasting promise
that the race should never again be drowned.
Notwithstanding all the deeply-seated opinions concerning the
truthfulness of this original conception, it is clearly demonstrated
0to those in possession of knowledge concerning the qualities and properties of light, that the rainbow has no signification, but is merely a
meteoric phenomenon.  And it is also evident that the early inhabitants, not comprehending these things, would have been very likely
to account for this phenomenon, and interpret its signification, on
some imaginary hypothesis.  For the human mind will investigate
all manifestations, and attribute every physical occurrence to some
cause; and if it can not discover the real, it will ascribe to the pheonomenon an unreal cause.  Hence the word "supernatural" has had
its origin.  But as those original conceptions are without the least
anterior truth, so this word is without the least signification.
Another species of prophecy is also derived from the same source;
and this is exemplified in the saying that " summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, shall never fail."  In order that we may have a,foresight of the future, it is necessary that we should understand the
immutable laws governing Nature and all things which are unfailing.
So in order to prophesy that summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, shall never fail, it is necessary for the mind to be perfectly familiar with the unvarying principles on which depend the vicissitudes
of the seasons.  This prophecy, therefore, is true and perfectly natural, being the decision of a convinced judgment that that which is
now and has been from time immemorial, will be perpetuated throughout eternity.
There are several other species of prophecy, -some of which are
(aithfully represented in the "Primitive History."  Some of the

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               419
authors of these were engaged in protecting kings and kingdoms
from the invasions constantly expected frorn other nations.  They
would prophesy evil and discomfiture as the fate of the opposing nation, while they would stimulate their own with flattering prospects of
prosperity and by promises of ultimate triumph. Others were engaged in performing various marvellous works in order to inspire confidence in the minds of kings and nations, by convincing them that
they were assisted by the deities, and that they possessed unsurpassed
wisdom.  Others would lead families and nations on tedious and
protracted expeditions, prophesying for, and governing and controlling them, until they at length, by the direction of their prophet,
would fall upon other nations and tribes, and destroy or disperse
themn, and then make their city and home the place of their own habitation. Other prophets or chieftains would prophesy against and for
kings and kingdoms, and incite war and bloodshed, all for the sake
of praise and emolument.  Some who were sufficiently ingenious,
would only prophesy that which was within their power to fulfil and
make true.  Others would consign all disbelievers, or persons whose
minds were too well organized to be governed by them, to the fires
of that gulf of which the sun was the representative.  But sheol, hades,
tartarus, and gehenn a, were originally used by them to express death,
darkness, the grave, pain, wretchedness, and sepulchrous abodes.
And as these words now stand in the Primitive History, they express merely the things to which they were applied by the Jews and
Greeks, and who would represent by them  a dark and loathsome
valley, impassible and dreadful gulfs, the dark and gloomy grave, and
darkness, death, ignorance, and wretchedness. Prophets would consign unbelieving and refractory persons to the hideous and dreadful
valley of gehenna, and also to the pit, sepulchre, or /hades. And
some prophets continued to speak of the gulf that was conceived of
and promulgated by the potentate of those southern tribes which were
the origin of the Jews.
~ 103. All prophecies that are contained in the Primitive History are such as have been retained from the innumerable manuscripts of the ancient prophets, and which seemed to have a connexion with one another and with the doctrines which the Jews felt very
anxious to sustain, so that the Gentiles might be entirely overcome
by the influence of their preconceived mythology.  More than are
now contained in the Primitive History were rejected as useless

and irrelevant; and this occurred before those which now form the
record were collected for arrangement. And the second part of the
Bible, some of which has no connexion whatever with the primitive
records, is also composed of a selection of manuscripts made by the
-ouncils of bishops convened at Nice and Laodicea.
The sacred writings of each nation during the era of oracles were
almost innumerable.  And after the age of prophecy, selections weremade from these materials by the various nations, and each nation
thus formed its own sacred records. And firom all of them the Jews
copied extensively; and such writings as were in perfect unity with
their own preconceived mythological theology, they preserved; and
those that were not, were thrice rejected and consigned to the flames.
Those manuscripts were without name and date, and disconnected
from all circumstances indicating their origin.  They were written
upon the soft bark of trees, and in hieroglyphical and pictorial characters.
The Jewish rabbins are well informed concerning the origin of
the Talmud; the Mohamlnedans are well aware of the origin of the
Koran; the Brahmins know the origin of the Shaster; the Persians
know the origin of the Zend Avesta: but modern theological speculators do not know of the origin of the " history" which they have
defended by the pen, the stake and flame, and most powerfully and
effectually by the potency of the sword.
For many centuries the Primitive History was uncondensed into
its present form; and there were manuscripts collected sufficiently
numerous to form a volume three times as large as the present book.
Each of these was without name, but nearly all were written by different persons; and the periods at which they were written vary
from six thousand to fifteen hundred years anterior to the Present
time.
The original manuscripts in. possession of the Jews were written
in the Greek language.  In addition to these, manuscripts of other
nations and writers were collected, and their contents were in like
manner transcribed.  And it was at this period that many portions
of the Primitive History were conveyed into Persia; and they
were there retained for several centuries, until the Jews were taken
into captivity, at which time the latter transcribed some of them, and
the remainder they brought with them when they returned to their
own country. This was the period of which I have spoken, when
many of the original writings, being opposed to their peculiar opinions,





## p. 421 (#449) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                421
were rejected. And those that were saved constituted the last will
and testament of the Deity as recognised by the Jewish rabbinical
writers.
This collection remained unchanged for nearly one century and a
half — after which a new revision occurred, which resulted in a rejec
tion of some of the then-existing manuscripts, and also in the divis.on of those which were retained, into books. These were subsequently divided into chapters, each book being named according te
the person who was supposed to have written the manuscript. Chap
ters were subsequently divided into verses; but all these divisions are
the work of recent date.
And in some passages in the Old Testament which seem to be
prophetical, and appear to correspond to that which actually did occur, the compilers occasionally changed the tense, to make the
prophecy appear more definite.  Many instances might be shown in
which the present tense has been changed to the past, and where the
future tense is used both instead of the past and present.  This may
be properly termed an era of heterogeneous theology, interspersed
with folly, ignorance, prejudice, and fanaticism.
The origin of oracles and prophets is, then, plainly understood.
They are an effect of ignorance, and uncultivated judgment, and imagination.  I have been impressed to speak briefly concerning them,
as they are unimportant in respect to the great end which these sayings are designed to accomplish.
~ 104. But it is proper that I should speak briefly concerning the
possibilities and probabilities of truthful prophecy.
The mode of oriental prophecy was to interpret signs as indications of future occurrences. But their signs seldom corresponded
to the thing anticipated.  The sign must always correspond to that
which it is made to signify, or else it is no sign.  The prophets and
dreamers were in the habit of producing simple and unmeaning
signs to represent great and glorious occurrences, or terrific and
appalling catastrophes.  Therefore their prophecies were unreal,
even if the thing foretold occurred: for there was not and could
not be any connexion between the occurrence and its representative.  Many prophecies were apparently substantially fulfilled;
-but these were particular and occasional occurrences, and did
not necessarily follow the prophecies in the form  of fulfilments.
Things prophesied according to existing probabilities, did sometimes

412            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
occur; but there is no evidence of the actual fulfilment of all those
ambiguous prophecies, many of which are contained in the Primitive History. Besides this, many of their prophecies were impure
and unholy, destructive to the morals and happiness of their own nation, and tended to excite hostility, envy, and sectarian vengeance,
in the bosoms of those to whom  their prophecies were unfavorable;
They breathed forth no celestial purity and refinement, but all their
deeds and expressions were blackened by sectarian fanaticism.  They
were not deceiving, but were deceived.  They should not be condemned, but it should be regretted that they were not delivered fromn
the bondage of sectarian corruption into the congenial atmosphere of
light, reason, and happiness.
To prophesy or foretell truly an event, the person must be in conmmunion with the original design of the Divine Creator, and with the
laws which are fulfilling design.  The mind, in correctly apprebending these, is enabled to foretell occurrences throughout eternity.
There can be no truthful prophecy unless the laws fulfilling design
are familiarly comprehended by the person prophesying. It is impossible to foretell an occurrence absolutely by the indications of any
external event or circumstance.  It is a thing which never has been
done, and can not be done by any being in the Universe. All things
that are truly foretold, occur as the. result of immutable laws, and not
of any mere fleeting and evanescent circumstances.
I am impressed to briefly appeal to the character of my own proplhetical impressions as these are presented to my mind by being in
communion with the interior reality and producing causes of all
things.  When I speak of that which shall be, I adduce no sign or
external evidence in confirmation of my prediction.  I present no
indication in order that the prophecy may be believed by those hearing it. The reason is plain why I do not: I can not conceive of any
external sign as demonstrating the thing or occurrence prophesied.
For it is impossible for an external sign to be in being as corresponding to the thing foretold; and the only external indication of the truthfulness of any prophecy, must be its own actual accomplishment.
Prophecies are truly made concerning the movements of the planetary.system, and concerning eclipses that are to occur; but there can
be no sign to demonstrate the occurrence of an eclipse before it actually takes place: and when it occurs, it is its own external demonstration.  But the prophecy is governed by unvarying laws; and it
is for this reason alone that it is infallibly true.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS,               423
Moreover, it is impossible for any mind to be enlightened firom the
higher spheres concerning incidental, external circumstances; for all
incidental and external circumstances are evanescent and changeable,
connected with no design, produced by no interior cause, and governed by no general principles.  Hence they are alike unknown to:he expanded powers of mind existing in higher spheres, and to the
uininformed minds of the present state of existence.  To definitely
foretell war, an accident, or any incidental circumstance, is positively
an impossibility; for it is not in the power of any internal and general principle to foreshadow to the mind a merely incidental circumstance.  It is upon interior principles alone that a prophecy can be
made with an absolute certainty of its accomplishment; and therefore if it were possible for these to foreshadow external and incidental circumstances, then prophecy concerning such might be relied
upon.  But as this is not in the nature of general principles, and is
beyond the power of individual influence, it is impossible for any
being, either in this or higher spheres, to proclaim the particular circumstances of an event, with the absolute certainty of their occurrence.
I am not impressed to speak concerning the innumerable volumes
that have been written on this subject; because these have sprung
from an understanding of the prophecies contained in the Primitive
History still more superficial than the character of the prophecies
themselves.
~ 105. Before I speak concerning many true prophets and truthful prophecies I will briefly appeal to the truths unfolded in the
Key, concerning immutable laws and their effects as the unvarying
manifestations of Nature and the Universe-and also concerning tile
artificial causes which are continually producing unreal effects, which
latter are the fleeting and evanescent circumstances connected with
social and physical existence.
By immutable laws, I mean that universal tendency of all things,
which can not by any possible means be interrupted, changed, or
frustrated.
The process by which man may become acquainted with these
laws, is by analyzing external, physical manifestations, and discovering their interior cause and governing principle. It has been established that external and visible effects can not be depended upon as
indicating their own interior cause; but that to become acquainted





## p. 424 (#452) ############################################


424            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
with the cause, the effect or form must be analyzed.  By becoming
acquainted with the interior and moving principles of Nature, we become acquainted with the elements of the Divine Mind, and also
with the universal designs of the latter.  These designs are the effects and developments constantly manifested throughout Nature.
By becoming acquainted with the cause, we become correspondingly familiar with the effect; and if it is upon laws that the mind
rests, effects and external manifestations may be prophesied with the
utmost certainty, millions of years in advance. For laws and principles are the producing causes of all effects; and all physical effects,
developments, and manifestations, are the real and inevitable consequences of the interior, divine, and creative Cause.  Thus, in the
beginning, a Cause produced an Effect, which became the cause of
another; and so cause and effect became universal and eternal, according to the promptings of the interior or divine Cause, wlhich will
produce one general, external, celestial Effect.  I have been impressed to speak thus much on this point, so that theologians may
know  the only basis upon which rests all truthful and infallible
pl)oplhecy.
Many conditions which surrounded the first types of mankind were
unfavorable to the proper unfolding of their mental faculties.  Tihe
consequence was, an improper tendency of those faculties and inclinations which otherwise would have been perfect and righlteous in
their operations.  From this youthful tenderness sprang all the gross
and imaginative impressions which are at the present day clothing
the minds of mankind with a most unreal and unfortunate garment.
The first misdirection sprang from  unfavorable conditions, and was
connected with no law, design, or principle, which governs the Universe.
Therefore those things which I term  unreal and superficial:are
circumstances which are created by prior and corresponding conditions, such as are within the power of mankind to produce, control,
and annihilate.  If superficial effects and circumstances such as mark
the incidental movements of society and the vicissitudes of government, or if any other exterior, obtrusive circumstances that have produced so much poverty and wretchedness in the world, were the
results of Law, Design, and established Principles-then the world
of mankind would for ever be in bondage, because these deleterious
influences would be beyond the possibility of human control. But
the truth is, Man has created these circumstances, and he has the





## p. 425 (#453) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                425
power to remove them.  Therefore, as these circumstances happen
only as thousands of contingencies conduce to their development, it
is positively impossible to foretell them with an absolute certainty of
their fulfilment.
What I mean by circumst(lnces, then, are those contingent occurrences which are entirely disconnected from Design or Law, being
created and developed by man. And what I mean by external
physical manifestations are the unvarying effects and consequences
of an interior divine and unchangeable Cause.
Many of the early prophets did pretend to foretell wars, famines,
and pestilences, and would produce simple signs, which they taught
corresponded to and foreshadowed the occurrence prophesied. Others would in the same manner foretell the destruction of cities and
downfall of nations, and speak of many things that were to occur in
future, and that would conduce to the advancement and emolument
of themselves and of those for whom they prophesied.  Many of these
prophecies are contained in the Primitive History. Some of them were
fulfilled; but this affords no evidence of the divine instruction of their
authors: for all external circumstances, which are dependent upon
favorable contingencies, are entirely beyond the reach of all prophetical minds or divinely-instructed persons, because these things are not
destined, but flow from the corrupted and evanescent tendencies of
human society and of physical existence.'['herefore I am deeply
impressed with the truthfulness of the proposition, that it is absolutely impossible for any being, either in this or any higher sphere, to be
instructed concerning evanescent contingencies, so as to foretell their
occurrence.with certainty.' 106. The object of making these things plain, is to establish the
probability of truthful prophecy, and to defend the Primitive History against the many false and imaginative interpretations that have
been imposed upon it.  The latter gives a very simple and concise
account of the prophecies of men who lived antecedent to its compilation, but many of these made no pretensions to prophecy beyond
the limits of their own era. Another object in making these things
plain, is to establish a division between real and unreal prophecy.
For there are prophecies contained in the Primitive History that are
true, divine, and righteous; and those who prophesied thus were instructed concerning the interior workings and tendencies of Nature,





## p. 426 (#454) ############################################


426            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS;.
and proclaimed, upon the unchanging principles of cause and effect,
many grand and holy truths-occurrences which will transpireeffects that will be accomplished.  These men had their internal,
thinking principles so expanded that they were able to recognise the
interior workings of all divine law, and thus could with certainty proclaim great and glorious truths.  Some of the teachings of these men
have been, by modern commentators and theologians, most unrighteously misrepresented.  For the latter, being misdirected in their
religious education, have not been able to discover the real, simple,
and unadulterated truths which are contained in many of the prophecies gracing the pages of the Primitive History.
But these prophecies have been misplaced and imperfectly apprehended; while among themn- are interspersed many unholy sayings,
and records of many unrighteous deeds that transpired among the
early inhabitants of the earth.  There are very many interpolations,
though these were not introduced with any evil intentions, but because the compilers seriously supposed that those additions should
be made in order that the whole history might present a connected
and comprehensive account of the things to which it contained
allusions.
Another object in making this clear is that the mind may thus be
freed from unnatural affection and sectarian prejudice (which is the
first necessary step toward a reorganization of society and the world),
and be inspired with the love of truth and truth only.
This, then, it is well to understand: that many local prophecies
which are to be found in the Primitive History concerning circumstances some of which were fulfilled, do not necessarily afford any
evidence of the celestial instruction of their authors, or of their superior theology.  And inasmuch as they are external and superficial,
they should be disregarded by those who are pressing forward to the
attainment of a higher order of things.  And it is well to understand,
also, that many prophecies of this nature which are true, have their
own proof, and further than that they are positively useless.
Then, on the other hand, it is well to remark that those prophecies which are founded upon the principles of Nature, and will be
fulfilled, should be regarded as substantial evidence of an enlightened
judgment and lofty spirituality on the part of their authors, and these
should be admired and appreciated. And it is proper that these
prophecies should be proclaimed to the world: but only as mankind
are brought to a comprehension of the causes to bring about the

NATURE'S; DIVINE REVlELATIONS.              427
event predicted, and as they are disposed to put forth powerful exertions for its accomplishment.
When those noble and enlightened intellects proclaimed that "' an
end shall be made of sin and transgression, and everlasting righteous-.
ness shall be brought in," they were inspired with the grand and
brilliant truth of a universal resurrection from all immorality and from
all unnatural social conditions.  And that mind which foresaw that
"death would be destroyed, and he that hath power over death, which is
the evil," was inspired with a high and truthful conviction, of the truth
of which Nature everywhere contributes evidence. And that mind also
conceived that this mortal and evanescent corruption which mars the
happiness and peace of society, would be exchanged for the genuine
principles of Nature, and that mankind would thus be made incorruptible.  He also saw that there would be a time when those corrupting and vitiating influences that shroud the whole mental and
social world, would be done away, and when society and the world
would be clothed with happiness and immortality.
And these things were proclaimed by all the pure and inspired
prophets since the world of social disunity began-even the final
restitution of all intelligent beings to primitive innocence and universal harmony.  And they plainly saw that when this occurred, there
would be no more sorrow nor pain, for the old and corrupted things
that destroyed the peace of society would have passed away, and all
things would have become new.  And they saw that this great renovation would constitute "a new heaven and a new earth, wherein
would dwell righteousness."  They saw the evils of society-the
immoral and corrupt situations of mankind-and proclaimed, according to the unchangeable law of progressive development, that evil
would ultimately be banished from the earth, that the " sun of righteousness would rise with healing in his wings," and that goodness
and brotherly kindness would reign universally.  These minds associated with the interior of all things, and received divine impressions of eternal truths.  They spoke not of higher spheres, because
the world was not yet sufficiently enlightened to receive the truth
concerning these.   But they spake concerning present evil and mortality, and concerning future goodness and the permanent restitution
of the whole race to peace and harmony.
They foresaw that a great Exemplifier of the true moral and spiritual qualities of man would ultimately appear. They saw that he
would, because of his superior qualifications, manifest all that purity





## p. 428 (#456) ############################################


428            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and gentleness of disposition, and all that loving kindness and consociality, that would be to the world a type of social harmony and
spiritual perfection.  They saw that he would possess all the natural
abilities and superior endowments to which the whole race would ultimately progress.  They saw that in him would be developed all
that high moral purity and spirituality which every human being possesses undeveloped. He was to be a simple type of spiritual goodness and perfect social qualification.  This they proclaimed to the
world, because they were impressed thus to do by the teachings of
their internal principles which communed with the divine Principles
that sustain and control the Universe, and which emanate from the
inexpressible Vortex of celestial Love and Wisdom.
These prophecies show that their authors had a truthful knowledge
of the Principles of Nature, and of the divine Design which those
principles are constantly manifesting.  Tney prove that their minds
were maturely developed, and were fit receptacles for the influx of
wisdom and knowledge.
It was thus that they foresaw that which has been fulfilled, and that
which shall be in future.  And their prophecies are susceptible of
demonstration, because they are based upon those unerring laws that
must of necessity ultimate in the effects predicted.  They saw (what
was spoken of in the Key) that Truth is a positive principle, and
that Error is negative and superficial; and they saw that that which
is positive and eternal must transcend and subdue that which is merely
fleeting and superficial.
~ 107. I now proceed to consider another idea in the series, which
is concerning the birth and use of that being who was the highest
personification of virtue, purity, and goodness.  But before I proceed to speak of the prophecies and accounts concerning this noble
personage which are given in the Primitive History, I will introductively insert some highly-important reflections concerning the divine
origin of Truth, and its unchangeableness and omnipotence.
It must be distinctly evident to every mind that man did not create
himself, nor the vegetable and animal kingdoms: and also that he
did not plan and execute;the creation of the earth or solar system.
Nor was he in any way connected with the production, and the establishment of the harmony, of the Universe.  Nor is he engaged in
developing any new divine Principle, or unfolding from the Vortex
of the Divine Mind, laws or principles which never before existed.





## p. 429 (#457) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                429
Moreover, he can not, with all his pride and presumption, annihilate
or change one feature or quality of a single particle that enters into
the composition of an harmonious Universe. Nor is he competent
to alter Truth by reposing confidence in its opposite. And while
he is capable of believing or disbelieving, and exercising an affection
for, pre-impressions and all ideas which he considers truth, Truth
itself remains the same, and is not affected, either favorably or unfavorably, by the fleeting opinions of Man.
Truth is an element of the Divine Mind, and is developed by the
wisdom, uniformity, and harmony, which characterize and render
perfect all that is created.  It is therefore of divine and celestial origin, and is made manifest to the mind of man by the manifold expression of Nature and the Universe. Being an internal and controlling element, it pervades alike every department of the Univercoelum. It is therefore a necessary and unchangeable Principle, and
hence also is ETERNAL.  And while all created forms dwell in unity
and harmony as arranged in their respective spheres of existence;
while all rudimental productions are continually breathed forth and
perpetuated by Nature and her laws; and while all the celestial
spheres and systems of life, beauty, and perfection, continue to manifest and develop the same order and harmony, Truth will continue
to proclaim her divine and eternal omnipotence.  When all things
that are created are restored to unity and stand in their proper and
reciprocal relations, then may man perceive the full manifestation
of that Truth which emanates fiom the celestial Vortex of Love and
Wisdom.
Thus Truth is divine in its origin, eternal and unchangeable in its
nature, and omnipotent in its constitution.
The early inhabitants of the earth conceived that they lived upon
a flattened sphere, sustained by as many huge living monsters as imagination could well conceive. They endeavored to comprehend,
as'the human mind is wont to do, the causes of things manifested.
So they formed these chimerical conceptions; for they were not enlightened sufficiently to comprehend the truth, or to understand the
principles upon which they and the Universe existed. So it became
a universal belief that the earth was entirely motionless, not only because all external evidences seemed to demonstrate that conclusion,
but because they could not believe that such a sphere could possibly
revolve, and still remain in the same position, sustained by nothing.
Many writers of the books of the Primitive History believed this

430            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
conception most sincerely, and occasionally imbodied it, in poetical
descriptions, in their sacred compositions.  It was an opinion that
was not for a moment doubted, until a Grecian and an Egyptian
philosopher expressed their conviction publicly that the earth revolved. This opinion gained many advocates; but they were few
in comparison to those who sacredly believed in all the traditions of
their forefathers.
So the same impression continued to prevail almost universally
for many generations, until a well-known philosopher of modern times
discovered those interior moving principles which were to his mind
an incontestable demonstration that the earth and all kindred bodies
revolved unceasingly in harmony around the sun, their parent. He
thus discovered the truth; but that truth had existed the samefrom all
eternity!
The nations of the earth opposed him; for they had sacred oracles and prophets who taught a different doctrine.  All the ecclesiastics and potentates of the land, incited by an unreal and superficial
abhorrence of his heresy, opposed his efforts, and came near consigning him  to the flames.  These men were believing what they
supposed to be sacred truth, and felt that as truth sustained them,
they should in return sustain truth.  This false impression clothed
their minds with a fanatical hostility against all new theories and discoveries, which might in any way attract the attention of mankind
fiom those things which they were so firmly defending.
It is well to remark that the earth revolved before any being believed it, and that a discovery of the fact did not make it any more
true.   The information, however, was profitable, inasmuch as a
knowledge of Nature and her laws inspires in the enlightened understanding confidence in the Universe and her Creator.  At thle
present time, the modes and habits of thinking among mankind are
changed in many particulars and upon various important subjects;
but the people in general have improved in their intellectual attainments very little beyond those who opposed the promulgation of the
new astronomical discoveries.
Then whileiI~am impressed to speak of the Primitive History with
caution and gentleness, I am also impressed that it deserves no more
veneration than do the teachings of many other good minds that have
lived and written.  And while I discover interior and immortal truth
in many of the expressions, precepts, and examples, therein recorded,
I am impressed that they should be loved and admired for the r reality

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               431
and usefulness-not merely because this truth is found in those written or printed pages, but because it is Truth, and always WAS, and
always WILL BE.
~ 108. The reason why I am impressed to speak concerning this
"history" particularly, is, that there have arisen from its existence in
the world, huge monuments of ignorance, superstition, and misapprehension.  For this reason I have shown that some of its parts are
compendiums of oriental mythology-Jewish, Egyptian, and Persianic poetry-and of the productions of the brilliant imaginations
of minds uninformed.  There are many noble and enlightened persons represented in those written pages, whose powers of thought
and capabilities of imagination justly demand the deepest esteem and
admiration.  Many allegorical and symbolical representations therein
contained are exceedingly beautiful, and are capable of being interpreted in a most brilliant and magnificent manner.  But the world
clothes this history with *more divinity than it itself claims, and thus
shrouds the whole in a garment of gloom and impenetrable mysticisni, which does violence to the judgment, and distorts the faculties
of the mind firom their natural condition and mode of action.
When good and enlightened men put forth their thoughts to the
world, and when their noble works appeal to mankind for respect
and approbation, a due distinction should be made between these
and the unrighteous.  But men should love only that which they are
compelled to love from the force of truth, and repulse that which is
repulsive and uncongenial to their nature and mental susceptibilities.
The Primitive History makes us acquainted with some of the former
class of men and teachings: and these should be admired according
to that which is intrinsically worthy of approbation.
But good men and deeds should be as much beloved out of those
pages as in them. And no distinction of a superficial character
should be established between any members, classes, or nations, of
the human family.- Therefore, for those writers to be respected more
than is allowable according to the universal principles that govern
Nature and Man, would be to violate the plainest laws of equity, and
to forsake the divine principles of harmony for that which is disunited,
unreal, and confused.
While I am in a situation to recognise the causes of things, I can
not let that escape notice which is sowing the seeds of disunity and
corruption throughout the world. And when I investigate the origin

432            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of allegorical and mythological theology, I am compelled to speak
of the same in a style agreeing with the nature of my impressions.
And while I am conscious that the feelings, affections, and judgments of men, are deeply involved in this subject, and that for this
book men exercise love and admiration as if it were far more true
than the very Elements and Body of the Divine Mind, I am nevertheless constrained to speak seriously and unreservedly concerning
the truth or falsity of many parts of the same.  Yet notwithstanding
these affections for erroneous principles are created only by early impressions, it is proper that they should be gently appealed to, so that
the judgment may be brought to recognise the important truth that
if all those prophecies and sayings are divine and eternal, they will
remain unchanged, and be perpetuated through all generations;
while all invasive theories and hypotheses will be destroyed to be
known no more.
Let what I am impressed to state, then, be received as true or rejected as false, according to its appeals to your judgments.  And if
what I relate is not true, it will not injure that which is truth.  Be
not afraid, then, that truth will suffer from these investigations, but
repose confidence in its immortality and omnipotence, and be assured
of the weakness and evanescence of error.  Be cautious, however,
in your decisions, and do not receive that which does not address
your affections and judgment in the voice of reason, and which does
not receive spontaneous approbation from your interior principles.
If the Primitive History is an Oracle of Truth, no assistance from
man can render it more so.  Fear not, then, that truth may suffer
from the invasions of error and unrighteousness.  Those who are
strenuous to defend the sayings contained in that book are persons
who have an affection for early impressions, more than they have for
progressive discoveries in the unexplored labyrinths of wisdom and
righteousness.  Such as are apprehensive concerning the results of a
strict investigation, not only of this subject, but of many others, and
are not seeking to know what truth is, but are merely anxious to have
their present convictions prevail.
In view of these considerations, I find it proper to enforce the necessity of investigating all things, without entertaining the least doubt
as to the incorruptibility and immortality of truth.  And it is
proper to forsake all denunciation; though it may be that the world
will oppose the truth now presented with the same ungrounded hostility and prejudice as was manifested by those who opposed the

distinguished and venerable astronomical philosopher.  But remember that the earth continued to revolve, though the fact was wholly
disbelieved by mankind.  Remember also that truth will always continue to live, whether believed or disbelieved, either by the educated
or uneducated classes of mankind.  And let those who tremble for
the truth, whether this be such as is supposed to exist in the Primitive History, or in any other department of the Universe, arrest their
agitation and excitement for one moment, and behold their own folly
and imbecility-while Truth itself illuminates its features with a
smile of undying beauty!  Let Nature, the Universe, and the Divine
Mind, then, be the source of your instruction.  But if you desire to
behold examples of human weakness, read this History's commentators.
Search, explore, and discover truth, then, and place your affections upon it, because it is an element of Divine Wisdom.  Place
not your affections upon that which judgment disapproves, or against
which your spiritual sensibilities revolt.  Believe not a truth because
it was believed and taught before you lived, but because it is truth~,
leading the mind onward and upward to higher spheres of grandeur
and beauty.  Remember that the mind in its true state is free to think
and act-free from all sectarian bondage and superstition.  Meanwhile consider that the mind does not now act freely, or express its
serrous convictions, because it has fettered itself, and seems to have
no desire to become untrammelled.
Mythology has resulted friom prior ignorance and misconception;
and superstition, sectarian affection, and prejudice, have arisen out
of mythology.  All these have affected the uninformed minds of
generations past, and are inherited by millions of the freeborn minds
of the present era.  Hence your strenuous adherence to early impressions-; to what your parents have taught; to the sectarian interpretation of the Primitive History; and to sanctimonious and unmeaning ceremonies all of which have been, and are at the present
time, establishing walls of distinction between husband and wife,,
parent and children, brothers and sisters, nation and nation, and Nature and theology, and destroying the happiness of mankind.  And
these effects afford living evidence to the enlightened understanding
that whatever system has caused them is not divine —is not born of
Nature or of her Creator, and is consequently injurious and positively
unrighteous.  Learn fiom  these things, then, to modify your early
affections, so that reason may bring forth good and truthful sentiments,..'28

and that you may be rendered suitable receptacles of the spontaneous breathings of the Divine Mind, which is Love and Wisdom,
and is incessantly evolving the Omnipotent Principle of Eternal
Truth.
These reflections are presented as an appeal to your interior affections, and more especially to that divine principle, REASON, which
constitutes the interior nature of every man.
~ 109. I now proceed to commuriicate my impressions concerning
the prophecies and opinions relating to that lovely personage who
existed upon the earth, and whose history is so imperfectly and unrighteously related by many writers.  His birth and life have been
clothed with many unjust descriptions-unjust because they are not
true.  The writers spoke as men speak at the present day, from
early-imbibed convictions.  Many accounts that are given of him
are interspersed with plain contradictions of the fundamental principles of Nature.  It is well to elucidate the origin of these many accounts before I proceed to consider specifically the superior purity
and majestic greatness of him who came to enlighten the world.
In order that we may properly understand the origin of many doctrines relating to this subject that have been derived from the teachings of men called prophets, it is necessary to institute some considerations concerning the five books ascribed to Moses, and also-concerning other writings that have a connexion with the subject.
The first book, called GENESIS, was not written by Moses, but
the first part of it consists of traditional allegories of primitive ages,
and which existed in the world before Moses lived.  The description
of the formation of the world, of the creation of Adam, of the garden
of Eden, and the tree of knowledge, are figures that were used by the
previous eastern nations.  This book bears external evidence of its,own origin.
But theologians have supposed that Moses must have been instructed in the knowledge of these things many ages after they transpired.  Some have supposed that the earth is no older than is
indicated by the chronology of the Primitive History. They also
have believed, and have en'deavored to prove, that the allegories recorded in the book of Genesis were actual, literal truths.  It is well
to bear this in mind; for on this supposition all Christian writers
hlave lased their interpretations of accounts in Genesis as relating to
Ilhe birth, life, and office of JEsus, the great Moral Reformer.  They

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 435
have thus endeavored to form a connexion between the fall of man
in the garden of Eden, as related in Genesis, with a restitution which
they suppose was to be accomplished by the ultimate triumph of the
divine principles taught by Jesus of Nazareth.
It is distinctly evident that this idea could not have been entertained by those who wrote the books of either of the Testaments.
Tile apostles, in giving an account of the birth, life, and preaching
of Jesus, did not, in all' their writings, even once intimate any such
idea.  They do not speak of the original purity of man, and of his
fall, in connexion with the use of the birth, life, and preaching, of the
one they so much loved.  They do not even intimate that Jesus was
a means by which the race would be restored to any degree of refinement which they once possessed.  They say nothing of the garden of Eden, of the fall of man, nor of any of the allegorical sayings
contained in the book of Genesis.  Those who wrote concerning
Jesus must have known the object of his birth and preaching, and
therefore if the " plan of redemption" manufactured by theologians
represents the truth, it would have been mentioned by them as one
of the first and most important points to be understood when speaking of the birth and life of him who labored for a moral resurrection.
It is clear, fiom many expressions in Genesis, that this book could
not have originated with Moses.  But it was written by a man who
sacredly compiled the traditional mythology of the forefathers.  I am
perfectly convinced, from the nature of my impressions, that the
other books wlhich are ascribed to MIoses were in reality written by
him.  The history as contained in those four books is generally very
true; and for their truthfulness the books should be esteemed and
appreciated.
An account is given of the birth of Moses, or rather of the circumstances of his infancy.  This account, whether true or untrue, has
no possible bearing on the general history contained in these books.
It appears that the romantic account of his birth, and of his singular
position in early life, is true.  And the fact of his being discovered
in that novel situation excited among the inhabitants of the land a
great deal of astonishment; and as the account thereof was related
in a marvellous manner by those who discovered him, he soon became a distinguished youth: and the marvellous things that were told
of him were believed and improved upon by many tribes of the east,'including the Egyptians.  He thus became notorious among all, and
lie was consequently inclined to endeavor to sustain the general im

136            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
pression which prevailed concerning his superior abilities.  He was
thus led to form a studious habit, which unfolded and greatly ilnproved his mind.  It was for him, indeed, a happy circumstance that
those marvellous things were connected with his birth; for as all believed he was'destined for some high and sacred office, he' had no
desire to forfeit the regards bestowed upon him on that account, and
he was also led finally to believe as much as others, the idea of his high
destiny.  So these things operated upon his self-love, and he consequently pressed forward to the attainment of wisdom and knowledge,
transcending, if possible, that of any other man living in those times.
It is well to remark that the expression was in those times almost
universally prevalent among the eastern nations, that " the Lord-directed" -" the Lord spake," &c., and that they employed this
phrase to express the evolution of a thought.  The early inhabitants
believed that the " breaths" created their thoughts; and so they would
say that the "breaths" taught them to do thus or so, to accomplish
this or that, or to undertake a journey-all of which promptings
they implicitly obeyed if they were distinct and forcible.  This expression was modified by the subsequent generations into many
forms, until it became a cant phrase; and owing to the commonness of its usage, it became abundantly dispersed throughout the sacred writings.  The early inhabitants of the earth, and indeed the
nations existing upon the earth for many hundred years after, could
hot possibly conceive how thoughts could exist within them without
an influx of some exterior but invisible spirit.  The phenomenon of
thougtht led them into more imaginative speculations than any other
thing which attracted their attention.  So also it became a universal
expression among the prophetical writers, that the Lord spake unto
them-constructed plans-instituted questions -suggested signs,
&c.: for these they supposed came by direct influx from the thoughts
of the Divine Mind.  The conception of the invisible origin of
th~oughts was a natural result of the uninformed state of their minds
concerning the causes of mental phenomena.  They used the term
A' Lord" in the same sense as I use the term " impression;" for their,thoughts were caused by associations with similar truths to those with
7which I associate.  So if, instead of using the expression " the Lord
spake," they had said, "I am impressed with such or such a thought,"
then would theologians of the present day have comprehended the
mystery.
Moses, ascending to manhood with a healthy and athletic constitu

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                      437
tion, and in possession of many superior intellectual endowments,
soon began to teach learnedly, attributing his impressions to the influence of the Lord's invisible spirit, in accordance with the general
conviction of those times.  This, in fact, was the first opinion that
was enstamped upon his mind in youth; and in manhood the same
became fully developed.  Notwithstanding this error, he was far more
ntellectual than almost any other person at those times.
~ 1.10. It is unnecessary for me to enter into details concerning
his long and protracted expedition at the head of the Israelites, or to
consider particularly the accounts given of his many miraculous performances. But my main object is to notice some theological opinions that have been derived friom his writings.
Whether he was designed to be a leader and governor of the Israelites, is a question that should not excite discussion, as it neither
involves any important truth nor any principle of useful application.
But there are many erroneous impressions received from the miracles
which he is said to have accomplished wvhile journeying with the Israelites.  The account of his passing with the hosts of Israel through
the Red sea on dry land, is very truthful.  But what is said concerning the causes which produced the separation of the waters, is entirely
figurative, only expressing an external form of procedure which Moses
observed in praise to the Origin of the impressions which led him
onward, believing as he did that the Lord was the suggester.  The
passage of the Red sea on dry land, the waters being upon each side,
was not only effected by the Israelites under Moses, but was accomplished before, and has been since Moses lived.* For at that time the
water had merely receded from the elevated portion of the sea-bottom
over which they crossed: for when the tide ebbed, this place, being
a sandbar, was left dry, like a beach, and therefore it was possible to
effect a safe passage across.
It was a custom  to wave a rod over, or to kiss, or to smite anything from  which assistance was desired.  These formalities were
also intended to express obligation and gratitude.  The account in* Th * author here remarked to those present when this was delivered, that he perceived hat this passage of the Red sea had been effected in the same manner as ii
was by the Israelites, by one of the five kings, accompanied by his army, spoken of
in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis. He also stated that Bonaparte, in a similar
manner and at the same place, crossed the dry bottom of the sea on the recession of
the tide, Since that period, however, the sea-bottom at the same locality had materially altered by the shifting of the sand.

438            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Jicates nothing more than this; as the rod was waved, and the waters
were smitten with tile garment, because the beach was dry so that
they could pass over in safety.
The account of their being followed by Pharaoh and his hosts is
also true, as is likewise that of the destruction of his army: for in attempting to cross, they were, because of their numbers, very much
impeded; and when they were nearly all upon the passage, tl1  tide
returned, and they were drowned.  Moses ascribes this deliverance
from their enemy to a direct interposition of the Divine Mind; and
so the event has been considered by many theological writers.
Other remarkable things are also related, such as obtaining watet
by the smiting of a rock; the rod being changed into several forms;
their being fed by manna which fell from above; and also many other
things of like marvellous nature.  Wliether any of these accounts
are true or untrue, is a question which should not engage the time
and talents of mankind, inasmuch as a solution of this question would
not produce the least possible good toward promoting a physical and
moral renovation of the human race.
Moses also speaks of receiving some divine commandments wvlile
upon Mount Sinai, and of receiving instructions from the Lord firom
a dark and immoveable cloud.  He relates that a voice came out of
the cloud to him while on the mount, which spake those stern commandments which were to constitute the law to govern the Israelites.
There are many very beautiful figures and allegorical representations
that have been suggested by the account of this very novel and mysterious interview; but it is my object at the present time to speak
concerning the origin of this account, which in its generul features is
substantially true.
Moses, after having been with the Israelites for many years, and
finding that many of them were exceedingly desirous of changing
their situation and government, conceived it proper that they should
have some specific and rigid laws. Finding it impossible to inspire
their minds with any real and substantial moral principles, lie conceived it proper to obtain by some means a code by which they
might be governed, derived from a source not known to them. For
as they were fanatical and superstitious, he could not instruct them
as he desired; for they were believing every species of phantasy —
and in these they reposed more confidence than they subsequently at
times reposed in their leader himself.
Moses, in view of these things, felt that he was divinely impressed

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                439
to leave the people for a time, and find some solitary and sequestered
nlace in the mount that was near them, where he might listen to the
Influx from the Divine Being, of such principles as would form a law
to those he was leading.  He obeyed the suggestion, and repaired to
the mount in silence.  In ascending he would occasionally arrest his
steps, and meditate upon the proper requirements of those whom he
saw spread over the plains below; and before he arrived at the top
of the mountain, many important thoughts were suggested to his mind
by the impressiveness of the scene that lay before him.  So lie sat
down and was absorbed in contemplation for mIany hours, at the end
of which time the ten commandments were framed in his mind, and
he wrote them upon stones such as could be conveyed to the valley
below, and such as were easily impressible.  At the time he began
to write, a cloud was seen on the mount, which moved not, because
of the stillness of the atmosphere, until lie completed thile ten commandments.  Believing from youth that thoughts were caused by an
influx from invisible, celestial beings, he supposed that at this time
all these suggestions proceeded firom  the Lord, who was clothed
with the cloud.  He accordingly wrote his opinion concerning the
whole divine instruction, and concerning the means by which lie obtained the commandments.  Moses, being more enlightened than any
other person, was capable of conceiving and formting those cotnmandments, fi'om the knowledge he had of the wants of those whom he
governed.
Some theological writers conceive that these commandments must
have divinely originated; and in support of this opinion, they say
that had these laws, which are of tlhe very highest morality, been instituted by Moses alone, or forged in those books by any olher writer, they would not have been so just or so severe: because if they
had been composed by man, they would have consisted of the easy
rules that man's inclinations always invent for his own government.
This reasoning is not conclusive.  For it is well known that nations
often create laws that are severely binding and compulsory, and that
the Hindoo tribes have codes and legal requirements eminently more
severe than those instituted by Moses.
It was the prevailing policy of the nations, before Moses lived, to
have the most severe and stringent laws, the violation of which was
punished with death as a sacrifice to the gods, whom they supposed
to be their lawgivers.  Moses also imbibed hereditarily the opinion
that these arbitrary forms of government were necessary; and his was





## p. 440 (#468) ############################################


440            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the most judicious and appropriate code of laws that ever was framed
by any governor in those times.  So the account which Moses has
written is truthful, and it is written precisely according to his belief.
It was the very best code of moral and social laws that could possibly
have been invented under the existing circumstances of those times,
and the potency of those commandments has been exemplified in all
subsequent ages.
111. Many writers have supposed that the law of Moses was
instituted to govern the world until the great Moral Reformer should
make his appearance.  This opinion is in one sense true-though
the two systems of moral government are not so intimately connected
as many are led to believe.  I do not perceive that it was tlhe intention of the Divine Mind to call into being a purer spirit for the purpose of doing away with the old law, and to establish the new.  Instead of this, it was by the progress of refinement and intellectual
attainment that the new reformation was determined.  It would hlave
been unnecessary to have highler or more refined principles to govern
the Israelites than those instituted by Moses; because if his commandments had been mild, gentle, and highly refined, the gross and
imperfectly-developed intellects of those times would have disregarded
their teachings: and disunity and disorganization would have been
tlhe consequence.  But the principle requiring "an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth," they could readily apprehend, and could
obey its requirements without misunderstanding its meaning; anti
this was a high moral law compared to that by which they had previously been governed.  So this was one more step in the progress of
intellectual development, and was an improvement in the mode of
government which before that period was grossly imperfect.
Tlhe law of Moses, therefore, has no real connexion with any theological system, except so far as it indicates a steady moral, intellectual, and social progression in the condition of man.  I can not conceive of any other use that it has accomplished besides that it has
served as a curved line to lead past generations to more truthfiul and
righteous government; and it should even now be to the world a
lesson of instruction.  It is merely a chart in which are represented
various courses of social policy, some of which led to evil and others
to good results-all of which have been pursued, and should not be
again.  Therefore the writings of PMoses are useful to the world at
the present day: yet only as a means of enlioghtening the uninformed,

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                441
and preventing improper adventures in the establishment of arbitrary
moral laws and government.
The ancients were in the habit of understanding all things by correspondences and allegories; and in relating accounts of things and
occurrences, they would often speak as if their correspondents and
allegorical representatives were themselves true.  This custom  is
evidently observed by the writers of the Primitive History, and particularly by the writer of the book of Genesis; for the writings of the
Old Testament are much characterized by allegorical and highlyfigurative descriptions, the figures being related as though they themselves were true, instead of being said to represent things according
to the intention of their writers.
This, then, is my impression concerning Moses: that being discovered as lie was among the rushes; being believed by all to be
destined to some high office, and growing up in the knowledge of
these things, in order to make good the opinions that were entertained
of hirm, and which he himself believed, he obtained great intellectual
acquirements.  His natural faculties being thus developed, he was
capable of conceiving more truths than others, and thus' became the
chieftain and governor of the tribes of Abraham.  These he led out
of Egypt, crossing the pass of the Red sea into the wilderness, where
one generation passed away; and the subsequent generation, imbibing, all the opinions of their fathers, became fanatical and enthusiastic.  Moses being inspired with more brilliant and truthful thoughts
than others, owing to his natural capabilities, produced the law and
ten commandments, supposing that he was assisted by a divine influx.  I-e was also capable of foretelling some occurrences (which
capacity was surprising to his brethren), because he was sufficiently
enlightened to infer the same with accuracy, fronom the tendencies of
existing circumstances.  He also received information from  his assistant JOSHUA, on whom  le would, by manipulations, produce abtormralness, so that he might dream and relate his visions.
In general, Moses's prophllecies were true, and he did that which
he seriously felt to be his duty; although many of his wars, persecutions, and invasions, are repulsive to the more refined feelings of an
enlightened mind.  He wrote the four books in a language suited to
the customs of that age, and intended no forgery or imposition, but
believed he was inspired with divine teachings emanating fiom the
fire, smoke, and thunder, on Mount Sinai.  And for his historical
and prophetical relations, he should be approved, admired, and ap

preciated, because they are substantially true.  But further than this,
his writings are disconnected from  any theological system  that has
been subsequently invented.  Therefore he who would be wise,
should firee his mind, if possible, from all theological systems that
have been founded upon a basis thus absolutely unallowable.
These writings, then, so far, have no use in common with the
birth and teachings of the Great Reformer, of whom  I shall hereafter speak.
Moses used the forms of expression and the singular modes of
allegorical representation which were customary among the Egyptians
and other eastern tribes.  And what should be particularly remarked
is, that this custom was to relate the allegory in such a manner as to
convey the impression that that itself was the thing signified.  He
also, as was the case with other writers, was accustomed to use the
third  e2rson1, which would naturally convey the impression that it
was not Moses who wrote, but some other person.  Also there are
many instances in the book of Deuteronomy where the pronoun,
first person singular, has been stricken out by compilers, and the
third person singular inserted in its stead.  Also, the present tense
has in some instances been changed to the future; and so firom  the
present English version it is impossible, according to our grammatical
rules, to decide whether Moses was the writer, or whether the books
were originally anonymous, and subsequently named.
I find upon investigation that the last chapter of Deuteronony was
written by another person, who intended to relate the traditions concerningf Moses's discovery of the promised land, his divine instructions, and his death and burial.  The generals of this account are
strictly true, and need no qualification.
AAnoN, who was a contemporary and assistant of Moses, was, according to the relation given, nearly as useful a functionary as Moses
himself, in leading and governing the children of Israel.  But the
account given of Moses, as written by himself, displays more magnanimity than was possessed by any other person then living; and he
was declared to be the greatest prophet that ever arose in Israel, and
hat the Lord knew him face to face. (Deut. xxxiv. 10.)  Notwithstanding this is an exaggerated description of his powers of mental
conception, and susceptibility of internal prompting, he was the most
enlightened person then existing, either among the Egyptians or Israelites.
So Moses led the children of Israel through innumerable vicissi

tudes and deep afflictions, until they came near to the land of their
contemplated future abode.  But before he realized all of his prophetical anticipations, he ceased to live; and Joshua, who was prequalified, advanced to his position as prophet and governor.
~ 112. JOSHUA was naturally well constituted, both physically and
spiritually; and his mind was rendered the more fertile and susceptible of correct instruction by his being influenced by the rnanipulation of Moses.  This, I find, is clearly expressed in the last chapter
of Deuteronomy, and ninth verse, which speaks of Joshua, the son
of Nuin, as being " full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had
laid his hands upon him."  He was therefore rendered capable of
discharging the duties of his new station with as much exactness and
promptitude as characterized the proceedings of his predecessor.
So' Joshua now became the chieftain and governor of that expedition.
An account is given concerning the attacks made upon the inhabitatts of the promised land, and how the Israelites felt convinced that
a's the Lord sustained them and their movements, they would be eminently successful. Actuated by this unholy belief, they fought desperately, and apparently at the sacrifice of all natural sensibilities,
brotheerly kindness, and affection.  This spirit characterized their
movements while with Moses, and was still persisted in under the
sanction and jurisdiction of Joshua.'['he object of referring to this account is, to exhibit to a class of
mnen who are supposed to be true theologians, the absurd and destructive tendency of that doctrine which supposes that these bloody
and inhuman invasions were sanctioned by that Divine Intelligence
which knows no thought contrary to the indestructible indications of
Nature.  It is also to impress the conviction that such plans and
means as were employed to obtain the promised land, could only:ave originated in the imperfectness of the uneducated intellects and
in the false direction of the affections of men.  It is blasphemous to
believe and preach that these inhuman proceedings were sanctioned
by a Divine intention.
By some expressions used by Moses, Joshua, and other writers of
the Old Testament, one would be led to suppose (admitting their divine origin) that these wars, persecutions, and devastations, were not
only incited, but were pronounced good, by the Omnipotent Mind.
But this idea has arisen from a misinterpretation of the peculiar form
of expression contained in those books.  And it is proper that me:

444            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
should not presume upon that which is doubtful, or endeavor to establish a system of theology without even inquiring whether the basis
is competent to sustain the superstructure.
Joshua being rendered susceptible to interior impressions by being
subjected to abnormalness, could with ease and precision prophesy
many things that would and did occur, for and against the children
of Israel.  I discover no use that would arise from a further account
of the doings of Joshua and those whom he governed.
But as there exists an apparent uniformity in the prophetic succession, it is proper to glance generally at each one in the order in which
they occur in the Old Testament.
Whether Joshua wrote the book ascribed to him is not at this time
clear; but that the things therein related as appertaining to Joshua
and the Israelites are true, appears evident, and the account requires
no comment.  In those days the Israelitish nation had no king.  So
after Joshua died, they were governed by a number of Judges; and
hence the BooK OF JUDGES, which follows Joshua.
It appears that there existed great animosity of feeling among the
Canaanites, Ammonites, Edomtites, and others, toward the children
of Israel.  This was the cause of frequent wars between the former
tribes and the latter.  Notwithstanding the usurpation of the Judges,
and the advice of many prophetical counsellors, the tribes were not
adequately defended against invasion, but instead thereof, suffered
some of the most inconceivable afflictions.  1 perceive that nothing
occurred during the reign of the Judges that is remarkable, with the
exception that the Israelites became idolatrous and enthusiastic, which
led to a fanatical hostility between the governors and various portions
of the nation.  And the tribes were subsequently compelled to admit
that they had been worshipping gods that were not true, but false and
imaginary.  It was the general belief among the Israelites that only
one God existed, whom they called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob; but where or how he existed, was to them a profound mystery.
Mloses had taught them that it was by the assistance of the Deity
that he turned the waters into blood, and that his rod assumed the
form of a serpent, which was to be to Pharaoh a sign of power.
And he taught that the magicians were assisted by the same Deity to
perform the wonders which' lie for a time accomplished.  The design of the magicians was that Pharaoh might disbelieve Moses's
superior power, seeing that they performed the same things by magic,





## p. 445 (#473) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                445
which he professed to perform by the assistance of Divine power.
But in order to display his pre-eminence, his rod, while a serpent,
was made to swallow all the serpents of the magicians, with the utmost ease and convenience!  By what principles of motive power
the rod assumed life, is not explained; and how the serpent of Moses
could swallow and digest all the other serpents, is likewise a mystery
not unfolded to the rational mind by theological speculators.  And
how water was decomposed and transformed into blood, is also a
physiological problem yet remaining unsolved.
Moses also taught that he conversed with the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, face to face; that God manifested himself in a
burning bush; that he was enveloped in the cloud on Mount Sinai;
and that he was always at his command, whenever he desired his
Divine Presence. Aaron continued to give the same kind of instruction, which was subsequently promulgated by Joshua, and believed by the Judges and all the children of Israel.
Here, then, are striking examples of allegorical expression.  The
relation concerning the serpents, and the manifestation of Divine
power in turning water into blood, were representations which Moses
conceived of the pre-eminence of his own position and qualifications
over those of all others; and of his supposed supernatural assistance
and Divine instruction which established his authority over the people.  But in writing these things, lie related the figtire as being a
literal truth, which was the universal custom  among the eastern
nations.
It was a belief also among the Jews and Israelites that good and
evil bo.th proceeded from the same Divine source.  Hence in their
expressions they would convey the idea that the Lord would say that
they should do so and so, and then afterward would repeal the command, as if he had relpented for what he had before said.  So they
would say that " when a prophet is deceived, it is the Lord that deceiveth him."*  And they would also at times lose all confidence in
the Lord because of their oppressive afflictions, and burst out in a
flood of exclamations, saying unto the Lord-" Wilt thou be unto
us altogether false, deceiving us, and leading us into deep afflictions?"
So they would represent the Lord as instituting laws on one day, and
repealing them with sorrow on the next. They would charge all
their weaknesses, afflictions, persecutions, and disconsolations, to the
Lord, believing that all evil proceeded from the same Fount from' Ezekiel xiv. 9.

which all goodness also flows.  And they supposed that the Lord
was the originator of all thoughts, feelings, and sentiments, whether
good or evil, pure or impure; for, as I have stated, they could not
account for the evolution of thought upon any other conceivable hypotlhesis.  It was very natural, therefore, for Moses, Joshua, and the
Judges, to have the history of their afflictions, proceedings, and expeditions, interpersed with all descriptions of allegorical language
and conventional forms of expressions.  Further than these remarks
would indicate, no instruction that would be of any use at the present
day could possibly be derived from the theology and movements of
the Jews, or children of Israel, and their governors.
~ 113. The book that follows Judges appears to have been written
by the same person who wrote Judges and Joshua: because the connexion is clear, and the composition uniform  and historical.  As to
its truthfulness, nothing needs to be said; for I find no such discrepancies in the expressions and punctuation between the original manuscripts of this book and our present mutilated versions, as appear so
conspicuous in other books.
The BooK OF RUTH is useful, inasmuch as it contains some very
beautiful manifestations.of devotion, kindness, and refined affection.
It represents the peculiar customs relating to matrimonial engagements which then prevailed universally, but which were subsequently
reformed and essentially modified.  It represents also the custom of
maidens gleaning the fields, together with the customs of the husbandmen, which prevailed in those days.  It gives a description of the
separation and affliction of the mother and daughters; of the marriage
of Ruth to Boaz; and of the unity and affectionate friendship which
subsisted between the mother and her daughters-in-law.
The object of this book appears to be, not only to illustrate these customs of the eastern nations, but to establish the genealogy of DAVID
and his successors down to the Babylonish captivity.  This is continued in the first book of Chronicles.  It is clear that the compilers misplaced those books, and also their chronology; for the book of Ruth
is nothing more than an introduction to the book of Chronicles.  It
speaks of circumstances connected with chronology and genealogy,
and seems to have been intended as an introduction to a concise
history of the Jews, from David to Nebuchadnezzar, who overpowered Jerusalem, and led the Jews captive into Babylon.

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               447
After Ruth, is the book ascribed to SAMUEL.*  Samuel was also
a child of Jewish birth, and was much beloved, because he was supposed to be the chosen of the Lord, who, it was supposed, strengthened and caressed him during his childhood and youth.  During his
life, the Judges gave room to the establishment of Kings, like unto
those who reigned in various other portions of the eastern hemisphere.
The transition of Samuel from infancy to youth appeared surprising; and so he was soon elevated to a high degree of honor, and his
position conduced not only to his pleasure, but to his emolument.
Samuel, however, was a refined person, because he possessed a
combination of high moral and social qualities.  But I discover notliing important to relate concerning him, save that he was one of those
who are supposed to belong to a perpetuated line of prophets. This,
however, is unimportant, as the book of Samuel is, like Ruth to the
book of Chronicles, a mere introduction to the book of Kings and a
continuation of historical information closely following the book of
Judges.
The book of KINGS is indeed an index that points all human
governors to the fount of terrible wretchedness as the result of tyranny and oppression, or to the pure and silvery streams of wellordered social government, and a pure and refined morality.  The
book of Kings bears distinct evidence of being a compilation from
abundant materials, among which were existing the book of Isaiah.
For the thirty-seventh chapter of Isaiah is perfectly identical with the
nineteenth chapter of the second book of Kings; whllich latter appears
to have been copied from Isaiah, who must have written previously,
and whose writings must have been associated with those that precede his book.
I discover that the book of Kings is a confused, though concise
description, of the movements and jurisdictions of the kings of the
Israelites and Jews; and was written by the same person who wrote
Joshua and Judges.  The thirty-seventh chapter of Isaiah is not derived from Kings, but is inserted as the nineteenth chapter of second
Kings, from a serious conviction of the compiler that it belonged
there; and it appears that the books were originally compiled at the
tinme the Jews were under Babylonish bondage.
There are no prophecies contained in the books of Samuel and
* It will be observed that the author in speaking of the books of Samuel, and also
of Kings, employs the singular number, intending in each case to include the two books
in one.

Kings that can be of any possible use as applying to the world at the
present day; for all the prophecies therein contained are confined to
the age in which they were made, and relate to the movements of
kings and nations, and to wars, devastations, famines, and pestilences.
All of these prophecies were true, because of their authors' superior
power of interior perception and understanding; and they were, as I
have intimated, an advancement of those gross and imperfect prophecies that were common among eastern nations, many accounts of
which were contained in those books that were rejected at the councils of Nice and Laodicea as being undivine and uncanonical.  However, as the books display truth, they can be read with profit by
those desiring information on the subjects to which they relate.
Next follow the books of CHRONICLES, which explain themselves,
and therefore require few remarks.  The things therein chronicled
are also generally true, with the exception of some particular and isolated expressions which are so insignificant and unimportant that it is
not necessary to pursue a general investigation.  It however appears
that the last verses of the second book of Chronicles have an intimate
connexion with the book of Ezra, which follows.
The writings of EZRA contain some very valuable instruction.
The book bearing his name, as presented in the Primitive History,
is devoted particularly to a relation of events and occurrences connected with the return of the Jews from  Babylon, and the rebuilding
of their city and temple.*
It will be recollected that the author in previous pages speaks of his being in the
"sphere of causes," or in a condition to recognise the " internal reality" or " germinal principles" of the things on which he speaks. Accordingly, in speaking of the
various books of which the Bible is composed, the most forcible tendency of the author's mind was to observe the original manuscripts, rather than the writings in the
form in which they are now presented in the Bible. Hence his remarks on the primitive records and traditions from which the first part of the book of Genesis was comrn
piled. For the same reason, in speaking of the book of Ezra, and of those of three
or four of the minor prophets, the author's attention was attracted to the writers
themselves with whom these books originated: and in speaking of these, he has spoken
briefly of some things which they wrote which are not recorded in the Bible in its
present form. Some intimations, for instance, were given concerning the productions of Ezra, which can only be verified by a reference to the books of Esdras,
which claim to be written by the same author. But on reviewing the manuscripts
previously to committing them finally to my charge for publication, the author remarked in substance that although he saw the object of his being impressed to speak
aa he did concerning three or four of the less important writers of the Old Testament, he saw that it would not be necessary to publish anything he had said of their
productions, except what had reference to their books in their present form as recorded
in the Bible. He therefore only authorizes me to publish such remarks as appea.r

~ 114. Next follows the book of NEHEMIAH.  This is a continuation of the Ezraite history which speaks of the rebuilding of the
temple and other national occurrences, and sustains the character of
profane and ecclesiastical history. Nehemrniah was a good and amiable man, and was beloved by the people, notwithstanding his unhappy situation. And he was also interiorly enlightened concerning
many events and occurrences which in reality transpired many years
after lie ceased to live.
But as the book of Nehemiah is connected only with the circumstances of the times in which it was written, it is unnecessary that I
should enter into further explanations concerning it, or point out the.
interpolations which it subsequently underwent firom the hands of the
compilers of sacred books. And had it not been for the meditations
and history contained in Nehemiah, I am distinctly impressed that it
never would have been seen by subsequent generations: for as it was,
it barely escaped the same fate that many of its associate manuscripts
experienced.
For a truthful understanding of the contents of some of the previous books, this, and following ones, I would refer the reader to the
tlheological writings of SWEDENBORG, the enlightened philosopherespecially to a valuable work entitled "Summaric Elsxpositio Sensus:
P roltActici."  I will remark, however, that in reading the above work,
in order to comprehend properly the meaning of the author, great
caution should be observed in distinguishing the lr'omincnt plriiples
which lhe develops.  For there will be observed an apparent discrepancy between the.things I relate and those written by this Swedish
philosopher: and this discrepancy will appear conspicuous. when the.
external of the account only is viewed, but not when his- interpretations and correspondences are properly comprehended.  His writings do not unfold a germ of spiritual truth in those primitive pages,
because it is impossible for them to contain such, inasmuch as they)
are only historical accounts, and not spiritual reuelations.  So be.
does not unfold an interior meaning fiom these vwritings, but develops
a novel exterior application and signification, which robs the Old and
New Testaments of their present garb, and clothes them in a garment
of spiritual beauty of which they are unworthy.. So apprehend the
things which I relate, and know that I am  speaking concerning: the
and.the main object of this explanatory note is to exclude any idea of unlawful sup-*
pression that might otherwise possibly arise in the minds of those who mly now, or:
may hereafter, be but partially informed in reference to the above facts.

origin of certain biblical accounts, and not concerning the thousands
of creeds, doctrines, and commentations, that have been based upon
a still more superficial view of the subject.
Then follows the book of ESTHER.  This is also connected with
the national history of the times to which it relates.  But as it is connected with no theological system, and affords no prop or foundation
for the support of any theological speculation, it is proper that I
should forbear further remark upon it.
Next comes the book of JOB.  This book presents conspicuous
examples of hope, praise, and worship, together with distrust, disconsolation, and oppressive afflictions.  The book bears external evidence of Egyptian origin; for in it a distinction is made between the
evil spirit, or tempter, and the Lord, which distinction is not recognised in books preceding.  This was according to the traditional
Egyptian theology-Osiris being the spirit or Lord of light, goodness,
and prosperity, and Typhon the spirit of darkness, evil, and adversity.
The book of Job presents a character suffering inexpressible afflictions.  With this, many other characters are introduced, who play
respectively the parts of consolers, tempters, and persecutors-some
endeavoring to add more pain and create more distress, while others.would act as moderators, manifesting sympathy and spiritual affection,.and endeavoring to console the sufferer.
This book is imperfectly derived from the original manuscript;
yet it answers the purpose for which it was intended, which was to'represent allegorically the great afflictions and oppressions to which
Iman was liable, and how he must look to the Good Spirit, br the
Divine Mind, for succor and consolation. It teaches submission,
purity, and humiliation.  It also advises affectionate devotion to truth
-and virtue, and an immoveable confidence in that Divine Mind who
breathed into being the earth, plants, and animals, as well as MIan,and the starry leavens.  It teaches the evil consequences of vitiated
and unholy situations; the horribleness of unrighteous thoughts; and
the slavery and imprisonment of that mind and conscience which
4know no good.  Meanwhile, it teaches a devotional resignation to the
Divine Love and Wisdom universally prevailing, and to the Divine
Design, or laws and principles, that create, govern, and control, all
things.  It teaches that meekness, charity, patience, perseverance,
and virtue, should characterize the disposition and actions of every
being who is susceptible to the pains and pleasures ordinarily conoected with human life.

Such evidently was the intention of the book of Job.  Its instructions are pure and good; its style, though forcible, is gentle and
attractive, and its tendency is evidently proper and useful.  The
book of Job, however, introduces some characters into notice that
are subsequently neglected and forgotten; while others are retained
throughout the historical and allegorical relation.  Viewed in this
light, the book of Job may be made useful.  But this book is incoherent with every other part of the Old Testament.
I do not discover in any of these books any prophetic sayings that
have the slightest allusion to him who came to inform the world concerning their sins, and to bring peace on earth, and good-will to men.
Q 115. Should I proceed further with the present subject without
presenting some reflections in review of previous sayings and primitive customs, the matter would be left in some obscurity.
It will be remembered that in speaking concerning the nations that
existed upon the earth about the time of the deluge, and especially
those that dwelt in Central and South Amnerica, I stated that they
conceived the sun to be the face of a deity who disseminated evil
among them because of their abominations.  They believed the sun
to be the great vortex of central power, around which the Universe
revolved; and this constituted their peculiar conception of the great
Creative Cause.  It is not necessary that I should enter into details
concerning the various movements of this nation, or concerning their
division into tribes and families-and how, after their discovery of
the art of navigation, they migrated to the eastern hemlisphere, where
(as I am distinctly impressed) they formned settlements in Egypt and
also near ancient Jerusalem.
The Bible does not give a connected account of the origin of the
Jewish nation after the flood, but simply speaks of Abraham  being
instructed by the Lord in a dream, to journey, with his wife, to another portion of the land, whence sprang the various tribes of the Israelitish nation.  This account is generally correct: for it speaks of
one of those tribes which came firom  the south and settled in the
east near Egypt, of which Abrahanm was a distinguished member.
Frorn him forward, the history is correct in all its essential particulars.
The first account of building and architecture after the flood, and
when the earth had become dry, was that concerning the building
of the tower of Babel. - This account represents the descendants of

452            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Noah as congregating upon a beautiful plain, where all materials for
ouilding and establishing a city were abundant and accessible. Retaining their impression concerning tile flood and all its horrors, they
conceived the idea of building a tower so high, if possible, that the
waters could not ascend to their exalted habitation.  It seems from
this that they were not altogether convinced of the unchangoeableness
of the promise which Noah believed to be indicated by the bow in
the heavens.  The world was represented as being " of one language
and of one speech;" and so among these tribes there was a unity of
intention, and this was easily communicated vocally to each other.
They are represented as saying, " Go to, let us build a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven;" and it is supposed that the object of
this tower was to protect them  firom  being again destroyed.  The
account represents that the Lord sanctioned this movement by promising that whatsoever they desired and undertook should not be prohibited, and that there should be no interference in the accomplishment of their intentions.  The building then progressed, and massive
stones were conveyed to the spot, and were adjusted with a uniformity characterizing a superior order of architecture.  And while they
were pleased and elated with their progress, and exulted in the probability of the fulfilment of their anticipations, the account represents
the Lord to say, " Go to, let us confuse their language"!
Thus the account makes the Lord to sanction their proceedings,
and to promise that they should not receive from him the least interruption; and then represents him as repealing his promise, and sending forth his power to destroy their means of vocal communication!
And this is understood by theologians and their followers to be the
origin of the great variety of tongues and languages among mankind.
Those who have perused the theological writings of Zoroaster,
are aware that six thousand years are spoken of in his Zend Avesta,
in connexion with his Cosmogony, in such a manner as to render
the affinity plainly visible between his account and the account of the
six days of creation spoken of in the book of Genesis.  Among the
writings of the Grecians, the Persian magi, and the Egyptian priests
of the sun, may be found allegorical allusions to an oriental tradition
concerning the building of a Jaina temple, and how it was constructed in order that the inhabitants might escape another inundation.  I
am now distinctly convinced that the account of the building of this
eower is derived from an oriental allegory; for I can not find in all

my researches a single indication that such' an occurrence as the literal account would represent, actually took place.
After the time of the building of the tower of Babel, as spoken of:il the book of Genesis, many cities and temples are spoken of in
various portions of the books upon which I have briefly commenlted
My object is now to show the origin of the sect called the ZE'DS
or the fire and sun worshippers.
It was the theology of those southern nations, after they became
thus subsequently settled, that the sun was not only the centre of the
whole Universe, but that it was the throne and habitation of the Omnipotent Governor of all things.  Such was the theology of the Egyptians, Jews, Chaldeans, and some of the Persians.  In confirmation
of these statements I would refer the reader to the historical works
of Herodotus.
Thlere was generally much antipathy existing between the Israelites and the Egyptians, because of the dissimilarity of their beliefs:
one believing that the Lord resided in one place, and the other in
another; while the Zends and other sects were worshipping the sun,
and paying homage to the various celestial bodies.  There was also
a sect of DRUIDS who were similar to the Druids of the Germanic
tribes which were originally called Teutons.  This sect had much
formality in their mode of worship; for they wore badges, and were
appareled with clothing bearing representations of the sun, moon,
and stars, together with the signs and characters of the zodiac.
These would secretly worship the sun in their temples or the sequestered sanctuaries in whichl they would congregate.  Their form
of compact and mode of recognition were made up entirely of allegorical representations of the tower of Babel, of the various materials
employed in its construction, and of the various degrees of mechanical and masonic labor.  So each member of the sect or association
was made to correspond to the men who were engarged in buildinfg
tthe temple (or tower) and the institution corresponded to the temple
itself. And after the building of Solomon's temple, the associations
of this sect changed their institution to a representation of the temple
built by Solomon.  This sect, then, arose upon a foundation entirely
allegorical.  But as time will sacredize any institution, they were
finally led to suppose that their origin was of a divine nature.
It may be seen, in the fifth'chapter of the first book of Kings, that
tile Jews were not of themselves capable of building the temple ac(ording to the desire of Solomon; and that hle was obliged to send

to Hiram, king of Tyre, for some of the Sidonians to come (for they
were skilled in masonry) and build the temple.  Solomon declares
that the Jews were not skilled in the art of architecture, and were
unfit to construct the temple as he desired.
So it was by the assistance of the Sidonians that Solomon had his
emple built.  The interior of this temple displayed all the grandeur
and magnificence which the art of man could possibly produce from.
tile sublimest conceptions of architecture.  In the dome or centre
was a resplendent sun, glittering with the finest gold, and throwing
out radiations of the most exquisite beauty.  Also the interior represented the moon and stars, and the signs and constellations of the
zodiac. Together with this, there was a general representation of
the most gigantic and pusile animals that were then known and worshipped; also of such portions of the vegetable and floral kingdom
as were most esteemed by the forefathers of Solomon, and of those
who built the temple.  So it may be said, according to the account
of Herodotus, that the temple was a complex representative of the
whole creation, and of the sun,.as the central power of the Universe.
In the twenty-third chapter of second Kintgs, it may be read that
Josiah commanded that all the abominations of the temple and its
builders, and of those who worshipped the sun and moon, should be
destroyed and abolished.  All this he did because he had no sympathy with the sects of the Druids and Zends, or with any other
heathenish abominations.
My object in speaking of these things, as related in the Primitive
History, is to make plain the affinity existing between the opinions
of those southern tribes whose origin I have revealed, and the modifications of the same opinions as existing among the Jews and Egyptians. Of this the Primitive History itself affords a confirmation.
~ 116. While Josiah reigned, the law of Moses is said to have
been discovered, and its rules adopted and applied to the nation over
which Josiah was king. Hilkiah and others were engaged in establishing and promulgating the law of Moses.*  In the books of Kings,
mention is frequently made of the heathen worship and abominations
that prevailed, and also concerning the worship of the sun.  The
Pleiades (mentioned in the book of Job) were also in those days the
object of worship and adoration. For a classification and concise
application of numbers, as anciently suggested by the movements of
*See Second Kings xxii. 8, 10, et seq.; also chap. xxiii. 4, 5.

the heavens, it would be well to consult a work published by Scali
ger, a writer who discovered the Julian period.
All these sects were existing, and consequently their innumlerabl6
correspondences and allegorical representations, before Homer or any
other Grecian poet imbodied any of their thoughts in verse.  But
Hesiod, who was a contemporary of Homer, conveyed many of those
iemonic personages to the prolific imagination of Homer, and hence
the demonology and allegory so much interspersed throughout the
writings of that poet.  I would also refer to the account given by
Joseplius concerning Solomon's temple and the magnificence of its
exterior and interior.  So it is clear to a demonstration, that very
many of the things related in tile books tliat have been examined,
must have been derived from  oriental tradition and demonology,
~vhich, at the time those books were written, forned the foundation
and tlieology of many sects, and were consequently alluded to by
Moses, Joshua, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and others.
In confirmation of what has been said upon tl)is subject, I would
refer explorers of the labyrintls of antiquity to the images and hieroglyphics of Egypt, and also to their primitive records, which descend
into the interior of time many ages antecedent to the chronology of
tilhe Primitive History.  I would also refer to the traditions and writings of tile Cliinese, and to their records, wlhich extend in an unbroken manner thirty-four thousand years beyond the chronology of
the Bible.  I would also recommend a close observation of the nlatter and style of the writings of the Old Testament, which will be found
to exhibit undeniable indications of figurative and allegorical conception, which fact accounts for the many indefinite and ambiguous expressions which occur among the writings of those books.
It is also clear, from various external evidences which all point to
the same conclusion, that the accounts contained in those books are
generally founded upon actual historical facts, notwithstanding the
vast amount of skepticism which has arisen from the ambiguous style
in which these books are written.  But it is no wonder that skepticism has existed in reference to such a combination of impossibilities
as a literal view of these writings would present.  And it would be
equally natural to expect that an immense amount of superstition and
theological speculation would grow out of a superficial view of such
marvellous revelation.  The skepticism  has arisen because some
minds are superiorly enliglhtened, and can not repose confidence in that
which neither addresses their ju(lgtlent nor the'ir affections.  And by

being led to discard these teachings, they have alsb become incredu-,
lous concerning the great truth of immortality.  This is unwarrantable
and that mind which, fiomn such premises, rushes to such a conclusion, is as much devoid of reason as he who believes in immortality
merely because it was taught by his forefathers.  And Ininds of the
latter class have been led to believe in the divinity and sacredness of
every aword recorded in those ancient writings which now compose
the Bible.  And they believe this not fiom reason or understanding,
but from early education and firom the sacredness which antiquity has
thrown around these records.  More believe in the divine origin of
these writings fi'om  education, than do for any other reason; and
-more thus believe who can not comprehend the contents of a single
chapter, than there are believers of the sametlhings amnong those who
are superficially enlightened.  Such implicitly believe in all the sayings of this book and in the many doctrines whichl it appears to them
to teach, togethler with the flatteringo scenes of immrrortality which they
imagine to be therein set forth, without being completent to give a
substantial reason for their hope.  So persons of one class l)ave reasoned inmproperly and arrived at illegitimate conclusions, and have
no hope for wlich to give a reason; while others have not reasoned
at all, but implicitly receive the whole, wlhich is beyond. the capacity
of the mental powers to digest, and hence ehave no reason whiereon
may be founded a hope.  I would, then, refer to THE KEY, for a
proper exposition of the true course of reasoning; and the correctness of this may be perceived by observing the superiority of its tendency and application.
When passages occur in the Old Testament which make the Lord
say one thintg and do another; when, as in the case of Saul, an evil
spirit is represented as proceeding from the Divine Mind; and when
many expressions of like character occur, some of which are found
in Jeremiah, it is well to know that these have their explanation in
the fact that the different tribes and nations originally supposed that.the evolution of thozg/hts proceeded from  an influx of the spirit
of the Lord.  Therefore they would in their writings use the expressions, " The Lord spake"-" The Lord directed," &c., to signify this opinion, and would always write as if they actually believed
in this manner of receiving instruction.
When Saul desired the presence of the witch of Endor, lie merely
desired to have an experiment performed that would surprise and
terrify those who wo'uld hear of, or witness, the occurrence.  It is

clear to every reflecting mind, that neither Sarnuel nor any other
physical organization, after it had given forth its interior moving principle or spiritual essence to associate with higher spheres, could actually experience a resurrection, with a return of those vital powers
and mental faculties that before characterized the orgauization.  It
may be inquired, "How does any one know, from  his limited acquaintance with natural laws, that such an occurrence never took
place?"  In answer to this, I would remark that the laws of Nature
and the Universe are the mediums by. which dtsigns are accomplished-and that each law which exists at the present time, must
have always existed: for otherwise the unity of plans and designs
would not have been complete.  Therefore, if such an event ever
did occur, it must have been desiglezd, and therefore was a result of
an eterinal law.  And if that law in that instance accomplished an
eternal design, other instances of like nature would have subsequently
been numerous, according as all things in Nature gradually assumed
higher degrees of refinement.  And that law which was impregnated
with any ultimate intention of Ilis kitnd, would produce unceasing
developments of like nature, as the consequent and inevitable result.
I lhave presented these reflections with the design that they should
serve not only as a commentary upon the things spoken of, but as an
interpretation of all things that may follow in the course of my remarks in connexion with these writings and with the speculations of
tlheologians.
This account of Saul, Samnuel, and the witch of Endor, was derived from an occurrence which is distinctly presented to my mind,
but which it would be useless to explain. But I will say, by permission of nmy impressions, that tile account of the transformnation of
sand in Egypt into a certain insect which infested the whole nation,
and of many other things as being accomplished by the intervention
of the Divine Potwer, should be attributed only to thile style of expression and to the prevailing opinions of the nations and writers whose
thQughts are communicated in the Pritnitive History.
~ 117. I now proceed to a consideration of the book succeeding
Job, entitled " THE PSALMS OF DAVID."
It appears that soon after the decline of King Saul, DAVID became the chosen of the people, and was generally beloved.  David
possessed many superior social and moral qualifications.  He was
generally inclined to ideal and sublime thoughts, which proceeded

fi'om his high moral and spiritual goodness, and social affection and
friendship. His meditations were entirely a reflux of his moral susceptibilities. He possessed much of the spirit of wisdom and understanding.  His interior faculties were very much expanded, and he
was thus rendered a suitable receptacle of pure sentiment and prophetical knowledge.  He loved the silent and undisturbed groves,
wherein he could retire and commune with those more interior and
truthful associations of thought and sentiment which breathed praise
to the Divine Intelligence.  He esteemed it a great privilege to be
alone, and at such times he would compose and address his psalms
of praise and thanksgiving to the Divine Mind.  These psalms were
wafled upon the serene air of the shady forest by his selected and
favorite musicians.  He saw that the heavens proclaimed the wisdom
of the Lord, and that day unto day showed forth his handy-works.
He loved man, and adored and worshipped Nature, the Universe,
and the Creator. He was a good man, and was an exemplifier of
good and proper deeds.  His goodness imparts instruction, and is
worthy of imitation.
Thus I am impressed to speak of DAVID, because he uttered
mnany truthful prophecies concerning the prosperity of Zion, and the
ushering into the world of a great Reformer, who would possess
combined all the physical and spiritual perfections contained in this
rudimental sphere.
I would direct the reader's attention to a prophecy contained in
the second psalm, seventh, eighth, and ninth verses. It can be
proved to an absolute demonstration, that a prophecy like unto this,
concerning the birth, preaching, and spiritual kingdom of Jesus, was
made before the chronlological period of creation as set forth in the
book of Genesis, and consequently more than four thousand years
before Jesus was born. But before I speak further of David's
prophecies concerning this exalted personage, I will say that many
portions of the Psalms are very imperfect, irrelevant, and unprofitable; and that the present book of Psalms contains but a very small
portion of those Orphic hymns that were composed by David. The
Egyptian Orphic praises are all similar to those of David, but are
not so grand. And that David composed much poetry and many
Orphic praises, can be clearly proved by research among primitive
manuscripts. Many of David's sayings were not procured by the
Jews: and some that were, were voted uncanonical, and committed
to the flames.

cles concerning the life, government, and deeds of David, which are
inconsistent with the superior goodness that is related of him in other
places. He was said to be a type of the heart of the Deity, and yet
the purity of his character is destroyed in the minds of many readers
by some deeds which are ascribed to him.  He was at times unlortunately situated; and this fact led to a development of some gross sensualities that would not have occurred under superior circumstances.
DAVID alludes more definitely, to the birth and kingdom of Christ
than any previous writer in the Old Testament, and therefore he demands more attention; for his allusion is distinct and obvious, and it
could not have had reference to any king who arose subsequently in
Israel.  When David, in the seventh verse of the second psalm,
declared the decree, he himself (in language supposed to be uttered
lby the Divine Mind) impersonates the Son that was to be born. And
i>e goes on to state that his kingdom would comprehend the heathen,
who would come into his possession, and that he would inherit the
uttermost parts of the earth.  He relates this in an ambiguous manner, but the language is sufficiently distinct to apply only to the spiritual kingdom of Jesus, which was peace and righteousness.  David
also alludes to this period in subsequent chapters, although with less
distinctness; yet his allusions afford decided evidence of his own
spiritual love and wisdom.
DAVID was a man given to devout meditation, and possessed the
most refined and exquisite feeling, affection, and friendship.  His
meditations in the last three chapters of the Psalms are concerning
the praise that should ascend from every heart to Him who rules with
a Divine majesty, the Universe. He calls upon all things to praise
the Lord.' He considered the heavens as presenting evidence of
His great goodness and everlasting endurance.  He contemplated
tile sun as displaying His wonderful works to the children of men.
He would sing of the silvery moon; for it was to his mind evidence
of the greatness and indulgence of the Creator.  The stars of the
firmament, and all visible objects, proclaimed to his mind that the
Lord was good to all, and that his tender mercies were over all his
works.  In his songs of praise and adoration, he would also sing
concerning the temple and the spiritual Zion.  He calls emphatically
upon all to praise the Lord, because He is abundantly righteous, and
his mercy endureth for ever; and he closes by exclaiming with the
deepest emotion, "Praise ye the Lord!'

460            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
When David spoke concerning the mercy of the Lord enduring
for ever, it was firom an unavoidable conviction that rested upon his
mind from his serious and truthful contemplation of Nature around
him.  He, like others, had been led to suppose that the apparent
evil existing in the world had been disseminated by an evil spirit proceeding fromr the Divine Mind-the result of an obedience to which
would banish the transgressor firom His presence for ever.  But he
was constrained to acknowledge, fiom the ten thousand voices arising
from every department of Nature, that this opinion could not be entirely true: so he frequently proclaimed with great fervency that " the
mercy of the Lord endureth for ever."
The book of Psalms contains many imperfections; but in general
it is of useful application.  There is no importance to be attached
to it beyond the truthful prophetic instructions it contains, its superior
expressions of thanksgiving and praise, and its well-directed and usefill contemplations. Viewed in this light, the book of Psalms may
be read with profit.  But it is a book void of all general princi])les,
such as are necessary to create a confidence in the mind of man in
the unchan(geableness of Nature, of her laws, and of their Creator.
~ 118. Following the book of Psalms, are the very useful and
wise PROVERBS OF SOLOMON.  This writer had experience of the
most diversified and instructive nature, reflection upon which created
knowledge and rendered him wise. He was a man of superior abilities, having a perfect organization, which was characterized by health
and physical energy. He did not possess those refined and elevated
qualities, that characterized his father David, to any very high degree.  But some of his faculties were greatly unfolded, which gave
him great power of discernment, and disposed him to meditation.
His social and natural affections were fully unfolded an'd exercised.
This fact, together with his peculiar temperament, rendered him susceptible to all influences that arose from his peculiar and in a measure vitiating situation.  He had great powers of construction, which
enabled him to plan and direct the building of the temple; and also
great higlhmindedness, which was displayed in the exceeding grandeur,
perfectness, and magnificence, which characterized the temple, from
the very base to the dome, and rendered it a work of superior design
and architecture.
It was necessary for him to experience all that he did, in order to
unfold that wisdom  and understanding which he possessed beyond





## p. 461 (#489) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 461
any other king existing either before or since he lived.  Taking into
consideration, therefore, the particular temperament and organization
of Solomon —his elevated and vitiating situation, the physical influences with which he was surrounded, and the vast experience which
he possessed —he should be considered truly an enlightened man
in social and general affairs, the study of which is profitable to all
men.
His proverbs are concerning the attainment of wisdom, and the
advantages of sobriety, both in early and advanced life.  He gives
much proper and truthful advice, the good results of which will be
experienced, but only when the world discards all arbitrary and superficial government, and becomes reorganized upon the principles
governing Nature and mankind with an unerring government.
It is scarcely possible for any one to obtain the same wisdom and
understanding that Solomon possessed; because that would require
the same situation, influences, and physical constitution, that surrounded and characterized him.  All men are differently constituted,
and their external experiences are exceedingly dissimilar; but all experience the promptings of their internal principle alike, and all would
cheerfully obey its teachings if it were possible.  Ask not, then, wily
all are not righteous, but search for the reason among the thousands
of vitiating and wretched situations occupied by the various classes
of the human family.  In order to remove these destructive influences with their unholy effects, learn from Solomon to be wise; for
thus alone the world may become sensible of the causes that are
productive of so many direful and unrighteous results.
In the book of Proverbs there are one or two very slight intimations concerning the time when wisdom  and goodness shall become
universal; but this is spoken of in an ambiguous and indefinite manner, and therefore no comment or application is required.
The book of Proverbs is a concise embodiment of the results of
the experience of Solomon; and being a compendium of practical
thoughts and teachings, it is useful to be read as such, and its teachings should be applied to the human race.  Further than this, I discover no use'to be derived fiom this book.  And that this is its intention is made evident from its style of expression, from the nature
of its contents, and from its position among the books of the Old
Testament.
Then follows ECCLESIASTES, OR THE PREACHER.  This book
displays a vast amount of erudition and absolute knowledge.  It ap

pears to be a continuation of the book of Proverbs. It contains much
important and valuable instruction, and may be read with profit and
pleasure; and the scraps of truthful expression which it contains are
worthy of serious consideration.  But I observe nothing in this book
especially applicable to the ushering-in of the great Reformer, or as
relating to his spiritual teachings or kingdom.  The use, then, of this
book, consists in some valuable instructions and admonitions that will
be fulfilled when society is reformed.
The book following this consists of poetical meditations similar to
those contained in the book of Psalms, with the exception of their
imperfectness and sensual character.  The SONGS OF SOLOMON are
supposed to have some slight reference to the beauty and harmony
that would result from the principles of Jesus and from the establishment of his spiritual king-dom.  I do not, however, discover any
such reference; for Solomon possessed not the spirit of prophecy.
There are many ambiguous and inflated expressions contained in
this book, which neither involve any useful figure, nor any principle
of truth or morality.  Some of the songs are well composed, partaking greatly of the Orphic style of David, and also displaying the
spirit of wisdom.  The book, however, is useless, for it is void of
any exalted principles which can instruct the race and lead them to
a more perfect degree of social unity and mental refinement.  Therefore the Songs of Solomon might have shared the fate that many
kindred books did, without being the least loss to the world.
~ 119. Following these is the book of ISAIAH.  I experience an
influx of higher veneration for this writer, and am attracted to him
more strongly than to any other whom  I have examined.  I feel
constrained to speak of him with the highest respect.  He possessed
naturally a good and well-constituted organization. His temperament was warm, and he possessed affectionate social feelings; and
all his moral and intellectual faculties were also highly developed.
His endowments were of such a character as to render him a fit receptacle of the spirit of prophecy.  His mind was so constituted that
he was not only able to receive knowledge of, but to associate with, the
principles of the Divine Mind existing in Nature, which are the agents
and mediums through which eternal Design is accomplished. By
being thus spiritually qualified, he could and did prophesy that which
was fulfilled only when the Messiah came to breathe purity, social unity,
and consequent righteousness.  Isaiah spoke not concerning the day

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                463
and hour of, or the circumstances that would be connected with, the
birth and the establishment of the spiritual reign of this noble personage. He spoke not concerning any contingent, external, and
circumstantial events, that would serve as an indication of this occurrence; because it would have been impossible for him or any other
human being to speak with certainty concerning these.  But he could
speak with the utmost confidence concerning any event that would
result forn the manifestations of Divine intention respecting the nature of which he became enlightened.
He, then, like all other prophets, was fitted for the use for which
he was intended.  It was not a merit in him or in any other person
to be at times in possession of the spirit of prophecy, inasmuch
as an influx of Divine intention is a result of a superior organization,
not rendered so by the person himself, but by the superior in1fl1uences, both internal and external, that have governed and developed
him  from birth.  Considering the inseparable connexion which is
sustained between the Universe and the Deity, the whole fornning
one grand System, it is impossible for any rational mind to conceive
of such a thing as ".free will," or independent volition.  For if such
a thing existed, then would the Universe be disunited, and the Divine Mind would be incapable of communicating life and animation
to its various recesses and labyrinths.  The chain of cause and effect, and the bond of unity, harmony, and reciprocation, would be
broken, and the Universe would be no longer an organized system
of beauty and grandeur, but an incolnprehensible ocean of chaos and
confusion.
The Universe must be animated by a LIVING SPIRIT, to form,
as a Whole, ONE GRAND MAN.  That Spirit is the Cause of its
present organized form, and is the Disseminator of motion, life, sensation, and intelligence, throughlout all the ramifications of this one
GRAND MAN.  That Spirit is the Spirit of Truth, of Love and
Wisdom, and of inexpressible Knowledge; and this is the GREAT
POSITIVE MIND.  Then, again, this interior Spirit must have a
Form, through which its attributes may be developed, in order that
it nmay be called a perfect Organization; and that Form is the expanded Universe.  Therefore, there are only two Principles existing: one the BODY, the other the SOUL; one the DIVINE POSITIVE
MIND, the other the UNIVERCUILUM.  Man is a part of this great
Body of the Divine Mind.  He is a gland, or minute organ, which

464            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
performs specific functions, and receives life and animation from the
interior, moving, Divine Principle.
Here, then, is the result of these considerations: that MIan is an
organ produced and developed by a law pervading the whole organization of the Divine Mind, which law will therefore continue to govern him throughout eternity.  And if it were possible to conceive of
a gland or any organ of the human form as existing independently of
other parts, then it would be possible to conceive of the propriety of
the term independence as applied to man, viewing him in connexion
with the vast Organization of the Divine Mind.  If it can be proved
that there are organs in the human form not dependent on the form
for motion, life, or existence, then it may be proved that man is an
independent being, and exercises what has been termed " free will."
But if the first can not be proved, then the conclusion is irresistible
that the Divine Mind has created the universal organization of His
Own Essence, and instituted laws to govern the same, with the positive design that every particle should have a dependence upon the
whole, that all particles should sustain reciprocal relations, and that
the whole should thus form one united, harmonious System.  If
this conclusion is denied, it would be well for the one who denies it
to prove the existence of an actual independence in any part of the
human form.  When this is done, the great question may be considered as everlastingly decided respecting the doctrines of inzdefinite
friee will and of absolute zecessity.
The many high and noble qualities of which Isaiah was in possession rendered his mind suitable for the influx of prophetic knowledge, which he proclaimed with great perspicuity to the world. But
this was not a merit of his, but a natural consequence of the relations
which he sustained to those laws which he felt impressed would develop the event he was constrained to prophesy.  I would that all
ideas of merit were for ever dissipated fromn the human mind, and that
the mind might become rationalized on this subject.  Then much
knowledge concerning the Laws of Nature, and the Designs of the
Divine Mind, would be unfolded; and this would elevate the general mind, and produce a concert in the human family sanctified by
Nature as being in accordance with her immutable laws.
~ 120. ISAIAH being superiorly enlightened, was enabled to speak
with prophetic assurance concerning the beauties that will arise firom
a social and spiritual elevation of the race as determined by the tri

bmph of moral and natural principles. IHe was convinced, from his
prophetical meditations, that the world of mankind would undergo
such a change, as that unity, peace, and righteousness, would spread
over the whole earth.  His thoughts were not circumscribed by any
sectarian dogma, or any outward form of worship, but were as expansive as the wide-spread fields of Nature and the unfolded heavens.
He spoke concerning the mountain of the house of the Lord, and the
holy magnificence that will characterize the great temple of Mankind,
after goodness and virtue shall have become fully developed. He
saw that the germ of righteousness was deposited in Nature, and existed also in Man. He saw that this would unfold its divine qualities
into roots, and that these, again, would produce a body, which would
ascend and put forth branches throughout the world —which, again,
would bud and blossom  on the mount of the Lord, on the hill of
Zion.  Thus would be unfolded the beauty of the tree of righteousness whose everlasting branches would ascend through all the ce!estial spheres, with continually-increasing beauty, until they became
immersed into the celestial Fount wherein dwell unbounded Love
and Wisdom.
He saw that one would come who vould "judge among many nations," and who would deposite a germn whose growth wouldi produce a social and moral resurrection of all the world to harmony and~
righteousness.  He saw that one would come who would "rebuke
many people," unfolding the proper principles that belong to the nature of man, on the full accomplishment of which, error and false instruction would be for ever annihilated.  He saw that this would
cause all nations to 1" beat their swords into ploughshares, and their
spears into pruning-hooks;" and that then would exist peace on earth
and universal industry.  He saw that when this would be accornplished, " nation would not again rise up against nation, and that they
would learn war no more."  He saw that error and ignorance, which
are the causes of the various systems that exist, would be banishled,
from the earth, and that all sectarian and local hostility would be annihilated. He saw that when this unity of intention and action be —
came universal, "the wilderness and the solitary places would bemade glad, and that the deserts would be made to blossom  as the
rose."  He saw that the world would be no longer dreary and uncongenial from the prevalence of sectarian artificiality, but that it.
would be converted into an Eden whose firagrance would diffuse universal happiness.  HIe saw that this would;,be-accomplished as an i:r-.

evitable result of the moral and spiritual teachings of those principles
which have existed in Nature ever since the Universe had a being.
He saw that social unity would unfold spiritual righteousness, which
would become as a great mountain, a sanctuary in which the whole
world might congregate, and where the true worshipper might worship the Divine Mind in spirit and in truth. He saw that the time
would come when neither Jerusalem nor any other city nor temple
wherein sectarian teachings are promulgated, would be the sanctuary
of the true worshipper, but that his sanctuary would be the expanded
earth and the unfolded heavens. He saw that man would worship
because every flower would invite; and saw that every countenance
would be illuminated with brotherly kindness, such as would cause
the aspiring elements of the soul to ascend to that Divine Spirit who
seeketh such to worship him. He saw that Nature would sanction
the then-existing social government and spiritual condition of the
world, and that in the excellency of her superior beauties all men
would be united and happy.
Isaiah spoke kindly of the kings and kingdoms that then existed,
and of those that would exist upon the earth, and meanwhile admonished them to be wise, with all gentleness, meekness, and humilia*tion. For he saw'that one would come who would " neither fail nor
be discouraged," but would " exercise judgment among the nations,
and that the isles would wait for the fulfilment of this law."  He saw
that this great moral Reformer would " see the travail of his soul,"
that is, the development of his social and spiritual government, and
4' would be satisfied." And he saw that the time would come when
unto these divine principles " every knee should bow, and every tongue
confess that in them they had righteousness and strength."
Isaiah: exerted his influence to console kings, as many nations then
-anticipated invasion and destruction. He was considered by all as
-a general consoler, and would endeavor to convince their minds by'external representations, which, though having no connexion with'the thing prophesied, satisfied them of the truthfulness of his consola-'tory assurances.  All such signs were considered by Isaiah merely
Ias external representations, but not as confirmations of the occur-'rence foretold. But being in possession of the spirit of prophecy,
because of the influx of divine principles, he knew that the many,occurrences of which he prophesied would inevitably be accom-!plished. iHe foresaw the birth, the life, and the preachings of Christ,'and the iltimate triumph of the principlec which he would inculcate,

but was unable to speak of time, or any incident or circumstance that
would be connected with the occurrence of the things which he absolutely foresaw.
~ 121. Highly enlightened indeed must have been that mind which
amid all the artificialities of the world, and all the sectarian hostility
and local and national wretchedness which then prevailed, could see
that all this would be destroyed to be known no more for ever, and
that then the earth and the Universe would be the great worshipping
Temple, in which there would be but one Eternal Preacher and Admonisher, and He-the Divine Mind!  He saw that this great and
unfailing Shepherd would disseminate through the world by his teachings, the principles of love, unity, and reciprocation; and that he
would make every silent stream eloquent; every flower inviting; every grove a sanctuary of prayer and devotion; and tile whole earth a
fold of peace and safety in which all might be gathered, and firom
which no one could possibly go astray.
Nature breathes forth her interior-and immortal teachings, because
she is a child of the great Divinity.  She communicates these teachings to man, who feels them as the inexpressible promptings of his
internal being, because he is a child of Nature, even as she is of the
Divine Mind.  The spirit thus receives the truth, because of its susceptibility to divine influx.  And yet in the world the spirit has become encompassed with every species: of gross materiality, and therefore has not as yet unfolded its deep internal qualities, as it ultimately
will when new and superior influences are unfolded in the social
world.  Nature, according to the prophecies of Isaiah, is performing
the ultimate design of the Divine Mind through her eternal laws, the
accomplishment of which will conspicuously display the infinite perfection of the Divine attributes.
Thus I am constrained to speak of the prophecies of Isaiah: for
they are true and steadfast; and if the world will receive wisdom,
they will all be accomplished.  Will you not, then, abandon all sectarian affection and impure highmindedness?  Will you not seek to
become enlightened, and strive to banish all ignorance, superstition,
and hostility, from the earth?  Do you not desire to become suita
ble receptacles for the influx of Divine intention, so that this may unfold your interior nature, and enable you to associate with the knowledge of higher spheres, and be for ever happy?  Will you not dis-;card the unholy and vitiating influences that are now connected with

your social relations, so that swords and spears may become impleiinents of industry by which the physical requirements of mankind may
be supplied, and that the world may thus be elevated to the highest
degree of social unity and spiritual goodness?  Ye who are defenders of the prophecies, will you not put forth powerful exertions to
verify their teachings, and thus prove your defence to be pure and
genuine, by an actual manifestation? Ye who wield the pen of theological discussion and the sword of sectarian bigotry —will you not
forsake these useless instruments, and go forth into the world and
preach the doctrine of the Divine Theologian, and thus become useful instruments in accomplishing the designs of the Creator as manifested in his unchangeable laws?
Here, then, is a test: Ite who loves and appreciates the prophecies of Isaiah (or any others of similar nature), will no longer endeavor
to sustain sectarian institutions, or to perpetuate that state of things
which is necessarily productive of disunity, sorrow, and social wretchedness-but will go forth and preach universal redemption from
mental poverty, imbecility, and social disunity, so that the prophecy
may be fulfilled.
~ 122. The book following Isaiah is JEREMIAH'S prophecies and
historical records.  Jeremiah was very unlike Isaiah in his physical
and mental organization; for he did not possess so much of that spiritual refinement and devotedness to truth and knowledge as did the
latter.  Yet his social qualities were very active, and his attachments
were exceedingly strong.  His affections comprehended the whole
race, but his prophecies referred mostly to the events of that era, and
contain but little allusion to the great and glorious period of which
Isaiah so feelingly prophesied. His moral powers were not so unfolded as that truth of a very elevated character might enter; but his
powers of observation were fulll, and adequate to the fulfilment of the
office which he sustained.
His time and talents were chiefly employed in admonishing, instructing, and consoling, the Jews, whose bondage he very correctly
foretold.  As may be perceived by various expressions found in his
book, he felt constrained to prophesy of the invasion, subjugation,
bondage, and suffering, of the Jews, under the severe and powerful
administration of Nebuchadnezzar.  Jeremiah lived until the time
this awful occurrence took place, and was consequently involved in





## p. 469 (#497) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 469:the trials and sufferings of the Jews incident thereunto; and this circumstance of necessity confined his prophetic visions mostly to thentranspiring occurrences.
I find only one allusion in this book to the great Moral Reformer
and his social and spiritual kingdom, and this is very brief.  It is
sufficiently definite, however, to demonstrate his prophetic knowledge
and power of spiritual perception.  This may be found in the twentythird chapter, fifth and sixth verses.  The allusion here to the things
that were to occur in future, was not perceived by Matthew, or any
of the other historians of Jesus.  There is a passage in the thirtyfirst chapter, fifteenth verse, which has been supposed to refer distinctly to the coming and reign of the Messiah.  Even Matthew
quotes this in speaking of the children said to have been destroyed
under the reign of Herod, intending to convey the impression that
this occurrence was referred to by the prophet Jeremiah in the above
chapter, where he speaks of "a voice being heard, and lamentations
and weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, and could not be
comforted, because they were not."  Matthew must have mistaken
the allusion made by Jeremiah to the return of the Israelites to their
own land, for the occurrence said to have taken place under Herod
the king.
In this book I discover no useful or expansive principles, nor any
absolute allusion to the great and glorious era now before the world
in anxious anticipation. Jeremiah, however, speaks very plainly
concerning false prophets and prophetesses.  And this may be offered as a confirmation of what I have stated concerning the practice
that was general in those days, of kings having counsellors who could
prophesy, and these having in their charge persons who were susceptible to abnormalness, and who would utter in the name of the Lord
many false and deceptive prophecies. For a confirmation of this,'
read chap. xiv. 14-16, and xxiii. 25-35.  These passages will show
that Jererniah became very much exasperated, and felt constrained to
speak and prophesy against false and deceptive prophets which were
engaged in promulgating and perpetuating vice and wretchedness.
Each would prophesy in the name of the Lord, believing as they did
that the Lord spake unto them by the influx of his spirit. Read also
other portions of Jeremiah: and then bear in mind that many of these
prophecies became immersed into the Bible, and that they are at the
present timne interspersed througlhout various books of the Old Testament.  No one certainly will disbelieve what I have related concern

470            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
ing matters of this kind, when he can find the same confirmed in the
book of.Jeremiah.
This book contains many expressions of deep and heartfelt sorrow
for the afflictions imposed upon the Jews and other tribes by wars,
persecutions, famines, and captivity. He speaks very feelingly concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, typifying its downfall by many
significant and striking representatives, which most certainly proves
his prophetical pre-vision. He in like manner prophesied concerning the Babylonish captivity, and also the ultimate restoration of the
Jews to liberty and their own land.
Many parts of this book were revised by subsequent writers, and
the future tense was exchanged for the past, which would seem to
convey the impression that many things in this book were written
after the Jews were restored to freedom.
NEBUCHADNEZZAR, the great king of Babylon, was to Jeremiah
one of the most uncongenial and disagreeable of men on earth.
Therefore he spoke indignantly concerning him and his kingdom,
while lie manifested great social affection toward the Jews, for which
nation he possessed an hereditary affection and fiiendship.
The book following is named LAMENTATIONS OF JERE:MIAI —
being occasioned by the realization of anticipated captivity, and containing contemplations of relief to be given the Jews.  These lamentations sprang mostly from Jeremiah's social sympathies, which were
exceedingly excited by the sufferings and afflictions then being experienced by his brethren and nation. In view of the many horrible
occurrences which had befallen the Jewish nation, he could only
utter his lamentations and weep in sympathy. And being much depressed in view of these scenes of desolation, he endeavored to chase
away sorrow by indulging in prophetic hope, which is expressed in
different places in the book of Lamentations.
The writings of Jeremiah are not useful or important in respect to
the object contemplated in this book.  They relate mainly to the
wars and sufferings of the Jews, to their captivity in Babylon, to the
fall of Babylon, and to many shocking catastrophes that would befall
various kingdoms and nations of the east.  They are written in a
figurative and indefinite style, nearly in the imperfect language of
correspondences.  They are connected with no theological system,
and are absolutely unimportant to the world at the present day, with
the exception of a few figurative historical records contained in them,

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                471
which are true, and which, if read understandingly, may not be unprofitable.
~ 123. We next come to the book of EZEKIEL.  This writer was
similarly situated from youth to manhood with Jeremiah, and with
him possessed very many of the same physical and spiritual qualifications.  HIe, however, possessed but little of the true spirit of prophecy; yet in a few instances he bursts forth under the excitement of
spiritual elevation, and utters many-indefinite yet truthful sayings concerning the Zion of the Lord, and the Tree of Righteousness whose
germ would be deposited by Jesus-the fair Example of purity and
refinement-and whose qualities and principles would be unfolded
by generations to come, even by those of the nineteenth century.
The things written in this book also appertain mostly to the period
during which they were written, and to the period just preceding.  I
am not attracted to the contents of this book; for it contains many
gross and blasphemous sayings —more than would be permitted in
any other book so generally read.  In the ninth chapter sorme things
are expressed which are very repulsive to any mind of refinement, or
to any person who has an affection for spiritual edification.
And Ezekiel also exhibits what has been before stated: that.those
who prophesied were in the' habit of making the Lord say what they
themselves said and wrote, and that they would attribute false and
deceptive prophecy to the prompting influence of the Divine MIind.
Ezekiel speaks in the fourteenth chapter concerning prophets real
and unreal, and says, "If a prophet be deceived in a thing, I, the
Lord, deceive that prophet."  Ezekiel also writes as if he received
instruction from  the Lord concerning the baking of bread-and
how  they should procure, boil, and eat a lamb-and how they
should choose the color, cut the cloth, and make garments, for the
priests, &c.
It is well to remark that there is to be attached no blame to the
writer of this book for these unprofitable expressions, as he, like others, was habituated to such modes of speaking.  But what is unjust
and unwarrantable, is the arbitrary interpretations of those sayings,
and the unreal garment of divinity which has been imposed upon
them  by speculative theologians, and which conceal their meaning
from the mind.  This book professes to be nothing more than a collection of figurative descriptions, prophetic allusions, and historical
records, concerning the numerous afflictions experienced by the

472            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Jews, both in Babylon and at Jerusalem.  This book is also usefu.
so far as it presents a truthful history of occurrences and afflictions
experienced by bygone generations, and of the mode of prophecy
and expression that was then universally customary.
The book of DANIEL, which succeeds, contains more historical,
allegorical, and mythological representations and prophetical visions,
than either of the books on which we have commented.  Daniel was
very eccentrically organized.  He possessed some good social qualities, but was characterized more by the perceptive and moral faculties, which latter were highly developed.  He was but little above
the rudimental state of mental development, and thus perceived and
taught only that which was external and material.  His visions were
of the most eccentric and ambiguous character, some of which were
sufficiently definite not to apply to things then transpiring, and others
were sufficiently indefinite to apply to almost any material catastroplie-corresponding in this respect to various portions of the
Apocalypse.
Daniel, whose powers of analogy and comparison were strong,
prophesied concerning the rise and downfall of various kings and
kingdoms, representing the things of which he spoke by very si,gular
animals, soine of which would resemble the ichthyosaurus and the
iguanodon more than any other species.' Some of his metaphorical
beasts had more horns than any animal that ever existed upon the
earthi.  Nevertheless the comparisons were true, thouglh beastly.  He
symbolized some vast monarchies that should subsequently extend
over the earth, by an image composed of various metals, which signified the character of as many kings, and the different ages in which
they would reign.  His prophecies all related to kings that were to
Arise and pass away, and new ones that would arise in their stead.
These prophecies are very true, inasmuch as they have been actually
fulfilled in the successive tyrannical governments that subsequently
existed upon the earth.
The prophecies contained in this book are so exceedingly ambiguous and superficial that they do not demand that high andt spiritual
interpretation which has been given them by many biblical commentators and spiritualizers.  They are, however, capable of being interpreted as representatives of almost anything that may suit the fancy
of the commentator.  There are some rather beautiful yet terrific
figures, which have indeed a great deal of signification; but they can
not be made to represent those grand and divine principles which





## p. 473 (#501) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 473
alone can produce a resurrection of mankind to social unity and spiritual happiness.  Therefore they are unprofitable so far as the knowledge is concerned which the world requires for the accomplishment
of this great and desirable end.
It is humiliating to reflect upon the very many false and imaginative interpretations that have been placed upon the crude images and
imperfect correspondences contained in the book of Daniel.  Many
have- been led, even in the present century, to suppose that a general
conflagration of this terrestrial sphere is therein typified and absolutel:y asserted.  They have believed this, too, when Nature, her
laws, and the immutable teachings of the Divine Mind, have prornulgated a different truth, of which everything is a demonstration.
It is not to be wondered that persons not understanding the structure
of the Universe, nor perceiving the unchangeable laws that govern
her in harmony, should be imbued with this imnaginative belief as derived from theological interpretations of the book of Daniel, in connexion with others in which sayings of like nature are contained.
But Divine Love and Wisdom have developed the still more exalted
Principle of Truth —which will outlive all errors and imperfections
of the outer world, and preserve its omnipotence for ever and ever.
Let him, then, who is capable of receiving the consoling truths which
Nature everywhere manifests, rest confidingly: and he may thus rest,
because that upon which lie reposes confidence is divine, celestial,
and eternal.  Such principles are not derived from the books last commented upon; and lience, thouglh these books should be regarded as
true considered in an historical point of view, they should not be contidered as developing the celestial purity and greatness of Him who
reigns eternal and omnipotent.
Much time and talent has been expended in elucidating the vast
number of figures and correspondences contained in the books of
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.  The latter book, hlowever, contains
more local and figurative prophecy, and more ainbiguous and unprofitable matter, than either of the others.  Nevertheless there are
some very conspicuous and positive assertions in this book, which
have been rendered more so by revisers and compilers than the assertions of any other writers upon which I have thus fair been impelled to speak.  I need not mention any particular figures therein
recorded, or proceed to prove their non-allusion to the " Sun of
Righteousness," so brilliantly spoken of in Malachi, and so perfectly exemplified in the life and teachings of JESUS.  For it is





## p. 474 (#502) ############################################


474            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
unnecessary to prove that which has no opposers: and when these
sayings are opposed, then it will be time to verify them  by further
considerations.
124. I now proceed to speak concerning the book following
Daniel, entitled HOSEA.  This book commences with an account
of a command of the Lord to Hosea to choose him a conjugal associate.  The representation here recorded concerning the Lord's direction how he should marry, and how his children should be named,
is very unprofitable, and is indeed revolting to the feelings of every
person of true refinement.  It will appear in the highest degree improbable to every person of interior and truthful reflection, that Hosea
ever received an influx of Divine instruction to choose a wife as is
herein recorded, or concerning the names by which his children
should be known.  For these things would tend to withdraw fiom
the exalted character of the Divine Mind much of that veneration
wlhiclh it is proper for every being to entertain, and for every child to
be instructed in.  From  these considerations, it is clear that these
expressions must have been untrue, or rather must have corresponded
to the primitive mode of written expression.
It is not necessary to speak particularly concerning Hosea, as he
makes no pretensions to prophecy, but was only a general observer,
contemplator, admonisher, and instructor.  He observes the depression and disconsolation that were then enshrouding many kingdoms
within the circumference of his knowledge, and especially the Jews
and the house of Israel, which were within his immediate observation.
He saw the gloomy forebodings of vengeance fiomn the Medes, Persians, and Babylonians, upon the Jewish nation: and on seeing every tie which had previously united one nation with another exchanged for vengeance and retaliation, lie trembled in prospect of
what was to follow.  From these things he felt constrained to speak
against the idolatries of his nation, and their many eccentricities,
which were opposed to the commands of the Divine Mind, and
were against their future peace and prosperity.  He felt also that
it was his duty to speak indirectly and comparatively concerning the
Jews and Israelites, and to endeavor to enforce upon their minds a
deep and serious conviction that if they did not leave the worship of
idols and the practice of abominations, they would be ultimately subdued, their nation dispersed, and their beautiful city overthrown. In
confirmation of these things he offered many typical illustrations, and





## p. 475 (#503) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                476
spoke parables, as he professes to be commanded to do, in order.,
that their minds might be duly impressed with the awful catastrophe,
that was then hovering over their nation.  In contemplating these
things, lie, as all minds are wont to do under similar circumstances,
prophesied ultimate amelioration, such as was suggested by the yearnings of hope.
There are some indefinite allusions in this book to the Zion of
righteousness that was thereafter to exist; but they are so much intermingled with the occurrences then impending, that they are unimportant.  Besides, they are disconnected firom the general chain of
prophecy under special review.  So I find nothing in this book capable of a decided application to anything beyond the period in
which the book was written.  For the writer's feelings were involved
in, and his judgment exceedingly tramlnelled by, the many unhappy
circumstances of the times, and this fact prevented the development
of higher and more spiritual qualifications.
The book of JOEL, which succeeds, is mainly a recapitulation of
things contained in Hosea, with the exception of the introduction of
new figures, and a dissimilarity of expression. Joel also exhorted
the children of Israel to repentance, and enforced upon them the
necessity of being reformed in order to escape the direful judgments
of the Lord of Israel, who, he taught, would visit their land with a
consuming vengeance, and disperse their nation even to the lands in
possession of the heathen.  He introduced new and convincing representations of the great and awful day when the land that was then
fertile, yielding beauty and abundance, would be a forsaken and uninhabited wilderness; and when their city, along whose streets and
in whose well-constructed edifices happiness dwelt, and no fear or
consternation was indicated, would be destroyed and left desolate.
It was to be an awful revolution, and therefore many, like Joel, felt
it a duty to speak and prophesy concerning the best and most expedient means to escape the terribleness of the calamity, and also tc
speak concerning the great and glorious day when bondage would
be unknown to them, and the nation would be restored again to prosperity, unity, and brotherly affection.
He presents descriptions also of some very appalling manifestations of Divine judgment, which are calculated to operate strongly
upon the sentiments of fear and marvellousness, and to excite superstition to the highest possible degree.  Thus he spoke of a day
which should come when the Lord would pour out his Spirit upo',





## p. 476 (#504) ############################################


476            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
them, and their sons and daughters should have visions, and- their
aged men should dream dreams; when the sun would cease to give
its light, and the moon be darkened and changred into blood, and the
stars refuse to shine, and the earth shake to its centre, and darkness'
reign universally.
This very indefinite yet powerful representation bears all the appearance of a literal prophecy yet to be fulfilled.  But it will be
perceived by any enlightened understanding that all these physical
transformations are entirely opposed to all law and to the harmony
of the Universe; and therefore if understood in a literal sense, the
figures are untrue and insignificant.  But this was a mode of expression only intended to awaken the apprehensions of the Jewish nation,
and to impress them with the terribleness of the calamities which then
evidently awaited them.
Joel also says, " The Lord will show forth wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke."  It is
indeed unprofitable to consider these sayings as ever having proceeded from the Divine Mind; for it is infinitely beneath his supreme
dignity and divine majesty to condescend to present to man such terrific figures and sublime panoramas.  I find nothing in this book
absolutely relating to or foretelling the coming of the great Reformer.
The book of AMOS is a prophetic document concerning various
kingdoms and cities which are prophesied against in the book of
Daniel. This book also may be considered as a collection of private meditations and reflections on historical events intimated in
previous books, which books existed at the time this was written.
And as it is connected with subsequent records and prophecies, it is
unnecessary to remark further upon it.
Therefore I proceed to the book entitled OBADIAH —which contains tile impressions and prophecies of a herdsman, who, evidently
being excited by the then-existing circumstances, could not, because
of his peculiar mental constitution, refirain from uttering his opinions
and contemplations also.  He also spoke symbolically, but very
briefly and comprehensively, concerning things referred to in previous books.  So as there exists no apparent use in these sayings, or
capability of a profitable application, it is not necessary that I should
remark further upon this book.
$ 125. The succeeding book is entitled JONAH.  This book, in
an abrupt and broken manner, commences speaking of Jonah as





## p. 477 (#505) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                477
being commanded by the Lord to go to Nineveh and preach against
it, denouncing its destruction.  It represents the inhabitants of Nineveh as being ignorant, idolatrous, and wicked, insomuch that the
Lord became exasperated because of their continual abominations,
and determined in his vengeance to destroy the city.  To prophesy
concerning them, Jonah was selected. It appears that the Lord
spake to Jonah, and gave him his directions; and Jonah, to escape
him, proceeded to the seaside, where he beheld a ship, in which he
took passage for Tarshish.
It appears from this that Jonah was much opposed in heart and
affection to the thing commanded by the Lord: and this would appear to convey external evidence that the Lord was incapable of
selecting a proper person to do his will.  After Jonah had paid his
passage and embarked, he fell asleep under the weight of a heavy
conviction of transgression.  After this followed an interference of
the Lord, which is represented as destroying the equilibrium of the
atmosphere, and causing a most severe and tempestuous storm.  Jonah is represented as being the one who occasioned this terrible
storm, on which discovery he was, at his own request, cast upon the
agitated waves.
The relation also represents the Lord as preparing a fish, the capacity of whose stomach would admit Jonah, in order that his life
might be preserved.  How the fish was caused to move near the
ship where Jonah was cast into the sea, is not made plain; for it is
only by desire arising from  the sensation of the body, that any forln
possessing sensation is attracted toward the thing desired: and therefore the fish nmust have had a knowledge of Jonah's immersion, to have
been there at the time, and to have swallowed him so deliberately.
Several things are related concerning the conscientious convictions
of Jonah while in the " belly of hell," or hades, and also how he was
finally landed unharmed upon the beach.  After passing through so
many trials and transitions, lie felt persuaded that he had better proceed on his three days' journey to Nineveh, and there preach what
lie was commanded, which was, " Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall
be destroyed."
Such a novel declaration, not the least anticipated by the inliabitants, excited their fear and superstition to such a degree, that they,
at the command of their king and rulers, forsook all labor, and while
fasting, deeply repented in sackcloth and ashes.  Meanwhile, Jonah
withdrew to a short distance from the city, and reposed under a





## p. 478 (#506) ############################################


478            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
booth with the greatest self-complacency, and with the prospect of
witnessing a beautiful display of Divine vengeance, such as would be
to him a gratification, because of the sublimity of the spectacle.  But
it was not long before his prophecy was proved untrue, and he raged
with anger and disappointment. He was very much vexed that the
Lord had repented, and indeed was absolutely angry at his relenting
weakness.  So a gourd was created and destroyed before his eyes,
which typifiedthe forgiveness, and this led to a discussion between
Jonah and the Lord.  But the latter is represented as soothing the
disordered feelings of Jonah, and leaving him to learn, fiom what he
had seen, submission and forgiveness.
The book represents the Divine Mind as repenting- and as cursing a people who, as he afterward acknowledged, knew not their iight
hand from their left.  It represents his incompetency to judge of the
proper agents to execute his cornmands, and makes Jonah desire to
have his prophecy and opinions prove true-for the fulfilment of
which he had a heart to see that city, filled with ignorance; and yet
with beauty and animnation, absolutely annihilated!
I am not impressed that such a being as Jonah ever existed.  I,
however, distinctly perceive the origin of the book; but as this is
not particularly necessary to reveal, I let it pass, and proceed to
some useful considerations concerning the spirit which is said to
have actuated Jonah in his preaching, and to the application of the
account.
Mankind at the present day are much like the citizens of Nineveh.
They are ignorant, not knowing the interior from the outward, or
their right hand from their left.  They have a most idolatrous superstition, and a most distorted imagination.  They are existing anmontg
grand and beautiful external things.  They have beautiful and wellconstructed cities.  They have arbitrary and vitiating laws and governments, which require of man that which his nature and the constitution of the Universe absolutely prohibit.  They have temples for
the worship of imaginary beings, not transcending those of Zoroaster.
They have idols and graven images, such as convey to the mind superstitions and mythological thoughts not much above the worship
of the Ganges or of the Juggernaut.  They have, because of this
ignorance and disorganization, sinks and dens of loathsome iniquity,
wherein dwells every species of abomination and wretchedness; and
thus the whole race is most dangerously diseased —even like the
inhabitants of Nineveh.





## p. 479 (#507) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  479
There are those who proclaim  in these outward sanctuaries, day
after (lay and year after year, " Repent, or you will be speedily visited with Divine and consuming vengeance;" and if they are told
that the Lord repenteth, and will save the race because of their want
of proper instruction, they show by their expressions of indignation
that they would rather have the whole race sink to the lowest depths
of eternal darkness, than to have their preaching and proclamations
prove untrue!  Behold, then, ye who thus preach, your own insignificance!  Behold your dark and unnatural ingratitude to that Divine and Unchangeable Aind who breathes in every department of
his united Systern, forgiveness and reconciliation!  Behold, also,
your likeness, by observing Jonah in his self-complacency and in his
disappointment, for he is a correct mirror to convey the reflection of
your insignificance.
These teachers, then, are like Jonah: they would rather have
the great Nineveh of the world and the inhabitants thereof experience all the calamities which they have been led to preach, than to
have their prophecy prove false, or their present impressions demonstrated to be unfounded.  So much instruction, then, may be derived from the book of Jonah; and thus far it is a most perfect representation of the mental condition of the race in the nineteenth
century.  But further than this the book is unprofitable, and might
have been destroyed, like many of its kindred books, without the
least injury or loss to the world.
126. Next follows the book of MIICAH-W-hich is devoted to
meditations similar to those contained in previous books, concerning
the immense afflictions that were about being imposed upon the
Jews and Israelites, who had by firequent idolatries been contaminated.  This book is written in the style of lamentation, is slightly
figurative, and very little prophetical.  It professes to speak of no
occurrence, except what was expected to befall the Jewish nation
and cities connected therewith.*  It refers to the vast amount of evil
and wretchedness that was continually pressing more and more upon
the Jews and the house of Israel.  I discover no principles or figures
as contained in this book that will admit of a useful application.
I proceed, then, to the book entitled NAHUM, which succeeds.
The prophecy recorded in chap. iv. 1-4, concerning what should happen in the
latter days, appears to be extracted, almost word for word, from Isaiah ii. 2-4. It is
for this reason, I suppose, that the author appears not to consider this prophecy as
belonging to the book of Micah.





## p. 480 (#508) ############################################


480            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
The foreboding calamities of the times were also the subject of this
writer's meditations.  He speaks very briefly concerning the things
upon which lie felt impressed to prophesy. His book, as it now
stands, relates particularly to the evils that were coming upon Nineveh, which city appeared to him to be under the direct curse of an
exasperated and revengeful Deity.
Next comes the book of HABAKKUK.  This writer spoke concerning previous and present abominations that pervaded the Jewish
nation, even to an adulteration of their temple and forms of worship,
which idolatrous corruptions'seerned to his mind to be the very
stepping-stones to destruction.  He recapitulated in substance the
sayings of other writers concerning the destruction that was to be
experienced by the Jewish nation, and concerning an ultimate amelioration. Yet in this book, as in previous ones, I perceive no allusion to a period when would live the great Reformer: but the book
is confined, like former ones, to allusions to events and circumstances
occurring within the limits of that exciting era.
Then follows the book of ZEPHANIAH.  The style of this book
is more symbolical, and it contains some severe denunciations against
prophets and priests who prophesied untruly, and who had defiled
their sanctuaries of devotion. In Zephaniah's visions there are some
indefinite allusions to a period when happiness would again bless the
Jews, and when the house of Israel and the Lord's house would be
cleansed, and the latter rendered once more pure and suitable to receive a congregation of worshippers. But I discover no allusion to
the period when the kingdom  of Christ should be established on
earth, and when the Tree of Righteousness should bloom withrbeauty
and send forth a fragrance of harmony and happiness.  But the same
reflections concerning the Jews and their unhappy condition that are
found in previous records, are presented also in this book, though
they are expressed in different language.  There are, however, some
pleasing and beautifully-expressed sentences in this book, which may
be read with profit, though they are not altogether worthy of being
made the basis of a long theological discourse.  For they refer to
then-existing circumstances, and it would be an act of injustice to
make them refer to anything different.
The following book is entitled HAGGAI.  This is composed
mainly of admonitions and remarks concerning the rebuilding of the
temple after the Jews had returned from Babylonish bondage, and is
of no importance.

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                4S1
~ 127. But I am impressed to speak of the following book, entitied ZECHARIAH, with more caution and gentleness, because of the
author's very beautiful and truthful vision concerning Him who was
to come.  It appears that Zechariah was generally beloved because
of his amiable character and superior judgment.  He nevertheless
had all hlis feelings and affections involved in the sufferings of his
countrymen.  He records his prophetical reflections with great
warmth of feeling, and displays peculiar force in his expressions.
He appears to have written under the influence of a sanguine spirit,
characterized by a peculiar positiveness and determination, the same
being modified by a kind and affectionate disposition.  He also relates a variety of visions; but these are of a local nature, though they
are of such a character that they can be applied to more than the
then-existing circumstances.
About one third of this book is closely connected with the subjects dwelt upon in previous ones; and the other two thirds are devoted to meditation, and to prophetical allusion concerning the birth
of Jesus, which pure and perfect personage was ultimately to arise
among the Jewish nation, but whose teachings would be applied and
fulfilled only in subsequent generations, even near the present time.
I would refer the reader to the sixth chapter and twelfth verse, wherein are recorded some brief thoughts concerning him and this era.  I
would also refer to the ninth chapter, ninth and tenth verses, which
intimate quite as strongly the ultimate relief of the Jews, Gentiles,
and all the inhabitants of the earth, from ignorance, mental slavery,
and physical disunity.
It would be well for those who have speculated upon the subject,
to very cautiously read, and reflect upon, the expression here made
use of, to represent Jesus and his social and spiritual government.
He is here called " THE BRANCH"-which is indeed one of the
most perfect and truthful exoressions contained in the Primitive
History.
Many theologians have conceived, fiomn observing superficially
other isolated passages in the Bible, that Jesus was a being expressly
destined and created for the purpose of redeeming the race from a
fallen and degenerate condition.  Others have supposed that he came
metely to establish a connexion between the spiritual nature of mart
and the Divine Mind, and thus to serve as a medium through whichl
spirits firom this rudimental sphere might approach the presence of
Him who made firon internal Essence, the Universe.  Others lsave

482            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
supposed that he was a material organization capable of receiving
the Divine Mind itself, and that as such he came to reconcile and
elevate the spiritual nature of man to a degree whereby perpetual
communion with holiness and righteousness might be established.
Thile first opinion is in a measure true.  He was a destined medium and agent to unfold a higher degree of perfection than had
been before possessed by man; but, for this purpose, he was created, as all the human family are created, by the workings of the
laws and elements of Nature.  But the supposition that he came to
redeem the world of mankind from a fallen condition is exceedingly
contrary, both to the laws of Nature and the teachings of the Primitive History, and is derogatory to the unspeakable perfection of that
ESSENCE which has breathed life and animation throughout space.
By the word rcdemption, the mind is instantly led to conceive of
something being lost, or foifeited. I am impressed that nothing has
been forfeited as pertaining to the spiritual nature of man, so as in
thie least degree to require a supernatural restoration to a position
which man once occupied.  If mankind had once been socially united
by an understanding of the laws which breathe unity, harmony, and
consequent happiness, then would they, by means of that knowledge,
have perpetuated that unity through all generations down to the present day.  But mankind have not pre-occupiedthe position they now
sustain: and therefore the race has not fallen and degenerated, but
was merely misdirected in youth, and now only requires gentleness,of instruction, and the attainment of a pure and useful knowledge, to
effect its elevation.  Therefore the opinion is without foundation,
ithat the race was once pure, perfect, and united, and that it after-,ward degenerated, because man partook a little of the firuit of the

of this transgression, and to restore mankind to the position they
once sustained.
The second, opinion, namely, that JESUS is a medium  through
which mankind may ultimately receive forgiveness, and be admitted
to hligher splheres, is also unprofitable to entertain.  We can not conceive of any work planned and formed by Divine Love and Wisdom,

knowledge and predeterr ination, when his living energies were engaged in creating and organizing the Univerccelurn. For the supposition that he ever instituted laws (which are the very elements of
his rWill, and which are as unchangeable as his Divine Essence),
and afterward found himself incompetent to carry them out, and tc
perfect the System  he had erected-is a supposition exceedingly
unrighteous, and altogether opposed to his celestial dignity; and
therefore it should be discarded and never more promulgated to the
children of men.
But Zechariah has spoken the truth, and calls him a BRANH —
that is, of the Great Tree, whose Body is composed of the whole
world of Mankind.  He is a Branch of the great Creation, and a
putting-forth and development of its interior qualities.  And what
the world should be thankful for and delighted in, is, that this Branch
has produced such delicious fruit.  It does not follow that this Branch
originated and controlled the Great Tree of Human Existence, but it
was produced firom the qualities contained in the germ of the world,
which were absorbed by the roots of this Great Tree, and thus the
latter became developed through all the successive stages of its
growth, until it became prepared to unfold a BRANCH which would
bloom with the immortal fiagrance of interior purity and exterior gentleness.  And this Branch is JESUS, the elements of whose soul
breathed peace on earth and good-will to men.
This, then, is the Branch alluded to with so much feeling and elevation of thought in the book of Zechariah.  And this should be
considered the most truthful and significant expression that can be
applied to the great moral Reformer.
~ 127. Succeeding Zechariah is the book of MALACHI.  In this
is contained sonime superior prophecy concerning this Branch, which
was unfolded upon the Tree of Mankind, whose roots extend through
all lowver creations down to the incomprehensible Vortex fiom which
Love and Wisdom perpetually flow.  Thliis great Branch is by Malachi called " THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS;" and truly might have
been called the flower of material and spiritual perfection that would
bloom with healing qualities, the application of which would exalt
and make happy the whole Body of Mankind.
Such expressions found in this book as " The day cometh that
shall burn as an oven," &c., are ambiguous comparisons designed to
typify the great calamity that was to befall the Jewish nation at the

destruction of Jerusalem.  These very severe and indefinite denunciations have conveyed to the world many unprofitable impressions;
for they have been interpreted in a most unrighteous manner.  The
expressions-" The day of the Lord"-" the visitation of the Lord"
— " the day of judgment" —"   the vengeance," and the " consuming
fire of the Lord," and many similar ones-were used by ancient
writers, and especially the writers of the manuscripts now composing
the Bible, in a very unguarded and indefinite manner.  The Jews
had been so long in bondage, and had experienced so many devas.
tating invasions, that they were unable any more to repose confidence
in their own power of ever procuring relief.  So they fled for refuge
to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who, they believed, possessed sufficient power and spirit of retaliation to revenge them of
their enemies.  Hence occur those frequent expressions throughout
the Old Testament, and especially in various passages in Malachi.
Malachi intimates that one was to be created who would be king
over all the nations, and thus would relieve the then-enslaved inhabitants from their extreme suffering and wretchedness.  Him he calls
Elijah-who has been supposed to represent the great Reformer of
whom I have spoken.  I discover no use in this application, nor do
T discover any such interior meaning in the passage.
I forego, then, all further comment upon the books of the Old
Testament.  I have noticed particularly all prophetical allusions to
the birth and teachings of Jesus, and shown that they were all general
and anticipatory, but not particular, isolated, or circumstantial.  To
have made them so would have been beyond the reach of prophetic
powers.                     I
It is well to remark, also, that all intimations of the coming of the
Messiah were suggestions developed fromn the then-depressed situation of the various nations of the earth.  And it was in order to console nlinds laboring under the prevailing affliction that this event was
generally appealed to: and the prospect in some measure restored
confidence and energy, and inspired their minds with hope and brilliant anticipations' Aside from this, the writers of the O!d Testament professed mostly to relate mere historical truths; and many of
their expressions and illustrations are strictly mythological, being derived, as has been shown, from prior and early-imbibed theological
opinions.  We have seen also that many books in the Old Testament are absolutely useless, because they rather promulgate immoral

and unrighteous principles than that purity and celestial refinement
which would naturally be expected as coming from the Divine Mind.
In some books, however, there are very many beautiful conceptions
-figures that admit of literal or spiritual correspondences, in the
language of which the ancient inhabitants spoke of themselves and
all things created.  To this style of communication they became universally habituated; and they would express all their thoughts in an
allegorical manner, always relating the relpresentative as though it were
true, instead of the thing or thought represented.
If, however, all the sayings in the Old Testament were clothed in
a spiritual interpretation. it would not be of any possible use to the
world, inasmuch as the world needs new and elevating instructions
which will produce corresponding results, as affecting their physical
and spiritual relations.  A spiritual interpretation of these sayings
would be positively useless, because it would be incapable of a profitable application.  The Bible, thus robed, would not supply the
physical requirements of the human race, neither would it soothe the
affliction, of the suffering, nor be fit food for the widow or the fatherless.  Nor would it reform  the arbitrary and unholy governments
that now exist in various portions of the earth.  It could not wipe
tears from off all faces, nor banish pain and sorrow from the earth;
nor could it produce a social resurrection, the superior results of
wvlich would be spiritual happiness and exaltation.
Moreover, a literal interpretation of all the sayings of the Old
Testament, for the purpose of collecting materials to sustain a very
unrighteous theology, would not have any tendency to produce the
good results which are called for fiorn every department of the civilized and uncivilized world.  Yet the voices and supplications of
Nature can not be hushed, until the things called for are given in
abundance; and Nature, dwelling within living forms, speaks, and
loudly calls for amelioration fiom  ignorance, vice, imbecility, and
every species of social iniquity, transgression, and disorganization.
She has unfolded her choicest qualities in some noble forms of the
human farnily, which breathe the very elements of charity and'philant.ropy.  They exercise a benevolence unbounded-an affection
and sympathy comprehending the many requirements of all who
suffer in pain and poverty.
As the Old Testament, then, pretends only to be a history of circumstances and events of the ages in which it was written, and as the
men called prophets preteoded to nothing more than expressing

hppe and anticipation of relief, some of which expressions can be
distinctly applied to the life and character of Jesus; and as the
books have been collected and arranged by the agency of interested
compilers; and as the fixing of the chronology, the positions of
thle books, and the division of the same into chapters and verses,
have all been merely the work of those who were commanded
by rulers to collect and arrange them; and as they can not, though
generally true, essentially benefit the race, in any particular, it would
be well to consider the Primitive History in its primitive meaning,
and thus let it repose.  Mankind should forsake all dogmatism-all
sectarianism —all mythology- all unrighteousness —and become at
once associated branches of the great Tree of Righteousness. Then
the whole world of mankind may fully experience the ennobling'consequences arising from a proper development of their inherent
qualities.  Then, indeed, will the earth bring forth her choicest
beauties; and then will man be competent to appreciate the excellency of her productions, and thus BE HAPPY.. 129. AMONG the Hindoo and other eastern tribes, the Slraster
is supposed to be of divine origin.  They consequently venerate its
contents, strictly adhere to its teachings, and endeavor, by all kinds
of persuasion, to inspire faith in the minds of those who disbelieve,
and also to spread widely its doctrines and precepts. They entertain
the highest respect for the writers of their religious book, and
believe that they were inspired by good spirits to communicate such
a divine revelation.  They suppose that the world refuses to accept
it because the world is alienated from the favor of their deities, and
therefore is not permitted to enter into the enjoyment of their holy
religion, which they venerate with the highest devotion.
Such also is the case with the Persians with reference to their
religious book; with the Mohammedans, and with the portions of
the civilized world who have received, and reposed confidence
in, the superficial interpretation of the Primitive History.  All sects
that base their origin upon things contained in this history, suppose that the reason why all are not as they are, is, because they
have ascended to a higher degree of knowledge, and, therefore, are
permitted to enjoy these divine teachings, exclusively, while others
are groping in darkness of the most degrading character, u nstrength

ened and unassisted by that Mind who created them  and the Universe.  All sects see the superiority of their own religious possessions, and suppose that their light so far transcends that of all others,
as to render the latter absolute darkness.  It has been, therefore,
most seriously believed and promulgated by the adherents of every
sect and system of religion, that the reason why all are not as they
are, is, because all besides themselves are under the indignation of
that Mind who instituted their own peculiar sect or religion.
It is improper, therefore, as is manifest from these considerations,
to regard believers in the Primitive History with any more esteem
and affection than those who seriously believe the Shaster, the Koran, or the Zend-Avesta, for all are alike devoted to the faith early
impressed upon their minds, and therefore are alike subjects of custom, education, and misdirection.
I now proceed to a consideration of many principles and sayings
recorded in the New Testament which have been most unjustly
interpreted, and the interpretations of which are sowing the seeds of
error and sectarian dissension throughout the civilized and uncivilized portions of the earth.
The first opinion that is well to investigate is, that the New Testamen-t was suggested by the Old-that the prophets foresaw and
prophesied of it, and that it came to do away with the old law, and
to establish a new one in its stead.
In searching among the writings of the Old Testament, there will
not be found one slight intimation in favor of this idea.  Tile prophets nowhere speak of a new law that was to be thus written and
placed before the world, and by which mankind were to be universally directed.  They nowhere intimate that such a thing was ever
intended, or that it would be of the least possible use to subsequent generations upon whose amelioration fiom bondage of a social
and mental nature they so feelingly and explicitly prophesied. When
they alluded to the dawnings of a new era, and the establishment of
the spiritual Zion upon whose summit would bloom the Tree of
Righteousness, they in no case intimated that this would be a result
caused by any such written record as the New Testament.
Moreover, it is neither correct nor profiitable for mankind to believe that the Divine Mind ever instituted laws that he subsequently
repealed. There exists no evidence to convince the discerning mind
that a single law which once controlled and actuated Nature, has





## p. 488 (#516) ############################################


S488           NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
ever been repealed or in any way changed: but there exists universal and unequivocal testimony, both in the general manifestations of
Nature, and in the united experience of all mankind, that no established law, physical or mental, has ever changed in the least possible
particular. It would be as consistent and as righteous to believe that
the Divine mind had created pltysical laws to govern generations.
past, that he afterward discovered to be incapable of performing all
he at first intended, and that he therefore annihilated them, and created new ones to govern the same beings.  It would be as proper to
suppose that the physiological laws actuating and governing man's
physical constitution, are now entirely different from those controlling
the forms of previous generations —that the law governing digestion
was originally gross and imperfect, while food corresponded thereunto; and that now the same law is changed to an exquisite degree
of delicacy to perform the same office, because food is differently
compounded and transmitted to the stomach.  If these things had
ever happened, they would present unequivocal demonstration that a
law once instituted by the Divine Mind, can be changed, and a new
and different one occupy its position to perform the same office.
Therefore the belief that the law given by Moses to govern the
Israelites was of divine origin, and was to be to them a constant and
unfailing code of government, and that afterward this law was
repealed and annihilated to give place to a new and different combination of actuating principles-is a belief in that which is contradictory of the celestial purity of that Divine Creator, who, like his laws,
is unchangeable.  Nothing is more unrighteous than limiting the extent of divine knowledge, and circumscribing the movements of Him
who communicates life and animation to the whole Universe.
Moreover, if the laws instituted by Moses had been of celestial
origin, then their effects would have absolutely corresponded.  It is
well to inquire of those who are familiar with the early ecclesiastical
history of the world, whether such effects were universally experienced and manifested? If those laws originated in the Vortex
from  which Nature sprang, then their effects would have been in
accordance with the divinity of the Cause, even as Nature unequivo
cally shows to be the case with herself.  Again, if those laws were
of htuman and imperfect origin, then their effects would manifest imperfection.  It is well to inquire of those who reflect, whether this is
not according to the unvariable experience of all who are governed
by arbitrary and human laws?





## p. 489 (#517) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                489
The proposition, therefore, that the code of laws contained in the
Old Testament was instituted by the Lord, and that, being no longer
useful, it suggested the establishment of new laws, which are given
in the New Testament, is founded only upon a metaphysical specu
lation upon the relation which these Testaments sustain to each other,
and upon a superficial apprehension of their teachings.  Furthermore,
the partial knowledge relative to the teachings of the Bible is very
much against the soundness of the proposition under review.  For
while theologians have defended the doctrine of the Divine origin of
the primitive code of laws, they have at the same time limited the
application of those laws to the favored nations of the Jews and the
Israelites, while at the same time the great majority of the inhabitants
of the earth were influenced and governed by an entirely different set
of principles.  An admission of these views would circumscribe the
Love and Wisdom  of the Divine Mind to a very narrow sphere;
while on the contrary, Naturec positively forbids such teachings and
such a belief.
Many have supposed that these arbitrary laws and customs were
established by the Divine Mind among those only who were capable
of receiving their teachings and obeying their requirements, while all
the Asiatic world (which contained over two hundred millions of the
earth's population) were left in ignorance and imnbecility, and were
therefore excluded firom  the Divine favor.  But it is manifest to every person of discernment, that any system of worship producing
such effects, and being enjoyed with such marked exclusiveness,
must have originated in the huiman and not in the Divine Mind.
Those who enjoy such supposed celestial privileges, believe that it
is because of partiality to them in the Divine favor, that they are thus
enlightened and blest.  It is plain that if these laws came to man
from the Deity, they would flow directly among those who need instruction, and therefore the portion of the world that are not enlightened would soon become the receptacles of wisdom  and Divine
government, the results of which would correspond in their purity
aind perfection.
Neither is it righteous to believe that the Deity would breathe
forth thoughts to a select number on earth, with the intention that
those thoughts should be universally believed and made useful, and
meanwhile leave their distribution to be governed by the ten thousand contingencies controlling all circumstantial things, and which,
though Man may generally, he can not individually control.  Nor is





## p. 490 (#518) ############################################


490            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
it right to believe that any system of Divine teaching can exist in one
land, and be entirely unknown and unenjoyed in another; or that if
it ever extends to other lands, it will depend for its dissemination
upon paper, accuracy of printing, prudence of men, well-constructed
ships, favorable weather, or upon any contingencies which are capable of preventing any artificially-embodied teachings from extending
any further than to the small portion of the earth's inhabitants among
whom they may now exist.  Those who have an exalted conception
of the Divine character and government, repose confidence only in
that which is beyond the influence of contingencies or circumstances, and which even the constitution of Nature can not oppose or
reject. And such believe that all laws emanating from,the Divine
Creator are such as comprehend all living intelligences, such as know
no bounds and manifest no exclusiveness in their application, but
breathe a universal security and Divine benevolence.
~ 130. Again, it has been supposed that the Primitive History is
divinely originated, and is the centre of all moral and righteous truth,
to which even Reason-the pure promptings of the judgmentNature, and all things, should be considered as subordinate; and
that the truth therein contained is not universally taught and believed,
because the greater portion of the world is yet in ignorance.  This
supposition is also founded upon a want of due confidence in the potency of Truth.  For any law, substance, or organization, that is divinely originated, will be the same under all circumstances and conditions, and also will be manifested alike, universally. Remember
the earth revolved, though the whole world of mankind was at the
same time in ignorance of tile fact.  But with the same propriety
might it be said that tile earth revolved not until man ascended to a
proper degree of mental refinement to receive this truth, as that any
other truths have been concealed in the same way for want of mental
capacity to receive them.
It is useful to remark, also, that the productions of the vegetable
and animal kingdoms are constant and unfailing, and are not affected
by the mental convictions of man in the least particular.  Nor has
one physiological law been arrested in its operation by a universal ignorance of its nature and mode of action.  For the Laws governing
the Solar System, developing the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
and perpetuating physiological operations in the human constitution,
are Divine and Eternal, not affected by belief or disbelief; and thus

they proclaim the universal and immutable principles emanating from.
the bosom of the unchangeable Creator. If any system of religion:has the same Origin with these laws, then will its effects be as pure,
as unfailing, and as universal.
All arbitrary laws that ever existed upon the earth originated in
the hunian mind.  And I do not exclude the laws of the Hindoos
derived from  the Shaster, the laws of the Mohammedans derived
from the Koran, the laws of the Medes and Persians derived from
the Zend Avesta, or the laws of Moses derived from the Primitive
History.  Nor is it proper to exclude any of the diversified modifications of these existing in any other portions of the earth: because
their influence is partial, and their tendency is to restrict the teachings
of the Universal Law as displayed in Nature and in man, and they
are therefore unholy, imperfect, and positively unprofitable.
From these considerations it becomes equally just to suppose that
all religions and superficial systems of worship have originated also
in the human mind.  And I do not exclude the system of the Chinese, of the Hindoos, of the Moliammedans, of the Persians, of the
Jews, or of any who derive all their distinctive impressions from the
teachings of the Primitive History.  Any belief that has a tendency
to destroy the natural benevolence of a noble mind, or to restrict its
movements and circumscribe its sympathies and affections; or any
belief whlich infringes upon the high moral susceptibilities of mankind, and compels man to forsake the pure and divine promptings
of Nature, or those manifestations of the Divine Mind, which are general and unrestricted —is evidently demoralizing, retarding to mental
and spiritual progress, and tends to generate sectarianism and unrighteousness, and is indeed not worthy of the most contracted place
in the human affections, or among the approved tenets of the judgIllent.-'Those who have speculated upon the imaginary relation which the
teachings of the Old Testament sustain to those of the New, should
reflect seriously upon all the grounds upon which this speculation is
founded.  They should also consider that if the Bible is of celestial
origin, its effects would have been pure and celestial.  And if it is of
Zuman(t origin, its effects must have been, and will continue to be, in
exact correspondence.  Let these reflections always constitute a step
to be taken before the affections are bestowed upon any system,
and before the judgment assents to the truth or falsity of any pro
duction.





## p. 492 (#520) ############################################


492            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
It will be seen from  past investigations that the Old Testar.ment is
without a single intimation concerning the production and revealments of the New; that the prophets never intimated that such a book
would be written, or once mentioned the name of Jesus, or referred
to the account of him which would be given to the world in the New
Testament.  Nor is there any allusion to tile proposition urged by
theologians, that the law of Moses, given by the Lord of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, was to govern the children of Israel only until a
new law and a different set of principles were given to take its place.
This, therefore, is the inevitable and legitimate conclusion of these
investigations: that the Divine Mind never institutes a law in one
age, to be superseded in another, and by a different law; that Nature
everywhere proclaims and demonstrates this truth, and that even the
Bible makes no pretensions to the contrary.  The prevailing opinion, therefore, must have arisen from  a misdirection of tile human
mind by early impressions and education, and from misinterpretations
and falsifications of the Primitive History.
~ 131. The first book of the New Testament professes to be according to, though not writtc^n by, MATThEW.  This fact, however,
involves no useful consideration, though in connexion therewith it
may be stated that the sayings of Matthew were subsequently transposed and modified materially by revisers and compilers.
This book commences with a genealogical history of the succeeding generations firom Abraham to the birth of JESUS.  It then proceeds in a very serious and unsophisticated manner to relate the birth
of Jesus.  I am  not impressed to enter into particulars in relating
the history, or in quoting the account; but it is necessary only to
consider the internal manifestations of truth in speaking of the things
here related.
It is well to refer to Ecelesiasticus for a proper and truthful declaration concerning the importance of dreams.*  And with this on the
mind, it is well to observe that Joseph is said to have received instruction while in a dream, firom  an angel, concerning the holy and
immaculate conception-which surprised Joseph, because it was
opposed to his experience.  And lie was also directed in the same
manner in his future movements.  If Joseph had presented his own
testimony that he had had this influx of Divine instruction, then
it would be more proper for confidence to be placed in the relation.
" Ecclesiasticus xxxiv. 1-7.





## p. 493 (#521) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                493
But the book was not written until long after this alleged occurrence,
and after the death of Jesus.
Moreover, it is not proper to believe that a dream would have been
the only medium of the declaration of such a wonderful and incomprehensible occurrence. If the Divine Mind had intended to produce a conviction in the world that this child was of his Spirit, some
more grand and noble manifestations would have occurred-such as
would have been convincing from their very nature-such as would
have been lofty, sublime, and magnificent, becoming the character of
the Omnipotent Parent. The whole world would have received a
thrill of conviction-and of such a nature, too, that the judgment
would approve, and Nature everywhere sanction. Instead of this
being the case in the instance before us, a portion of the world is led
to believe that a violation of physiological law must have occurred,
and that the reproductive principles established in Nature were entirely set aside: moreover, such believe that the conception was produced and determined by an invisible and unknown Cause.
And thus the occurrence is called a miracle, because of the strange
and incomprehensible causes and violations that were engaged in its
accomplishment.*  Mankind believe this because it is related in the
first book of the New Testameri, and because it has been believed
by their forefathers and confirmed by commentators. And it is at
the present time immersed into the hereditary affections of men, but
is not in the least degree sanctioned by a well constituted and developed judgment.  It is a speculative hypothesis, but not a well-grounded conviction.
Philosophical researchers and investigators do not believe in an)
law as governing Nature, the planetary system, or the Universe, because their forefathers believed it, but because their judgments are
convinced, and Nature incessantly exhibits demonstration of the truth
of the conviction.  If this were the case with theological investigators, then would hereditary affection for peculiar modes of faith be
banished, and the judgment would receive and cherish only that of
which all things around and above contribute evidence.
It is not necessary to appeal to the united experience of mankind
to prove that such a preternatural conception is not true: it is only
necessary to contemplate upon the celestial majesty of the Divine
Mind, and upon his unchangeable laws, to know that he would never
* The author remarked incidentally in this connexion that the " virgin" simply
meant young woman in the language of these writings.

be engaged in such a positive transgression of his own nature and
dignity, or condescend to produce such a trivial evidence of his Divine purpose and of the superior character of his Son.
The prevalent ideas concerning this conception can not possibly
be received by every mind; and it must be plain to all who possess
any high degree of spiritual discernment, that whatever opinion can
not enter the universal mind, and be sanctioned by the sublime faculty of Reason, must be an untruth.
The human mind will admit all things that agree with its nature,
and are congenial to its requirements.  But no man (mark the assertion) ever really believed the miraculous conception as related in the
first book of the New Testament.  But mankind have cherished the
opinion, not from a conviction of judgment, but merely from  an (iffectionfor hereditary impressions. - Thus fa4fh in this idea has never
ascended the throne of Reason: and when the reasoning faculties
turn their attention to tile faith of the affections, they inevitably discover an unreal and imaginary belief, and retreat from the view as by;
a positive repulsion.  Tl-e faculty of Reason is a flower of the Spirit:
it blooms, and its friagrance is liberty and knowledge.  But the affections flow merely firom sensation, upon which is impressed hereditary
faith.  This faith exists only as an tireal direction of the desires and
affections; and from the workings of these, some are led to believe
that the judgments are convinced.  This is only supporting faith by
faith, and endeavoring to deceive the judgment.  It is standing in
awe, fearing that Reason may break her fetters, discover the deception, and discard all hereditary belief for ever.
The proposition should be well considered, That nojudginent ever
has, or ever can be, convinced of the truth of the miraculous conception. And this is presumptive evidence upon which to predicate the
conclusion that the idea in question is untrue.  For the reasoning
faculty is unfolded as a result of an immutable law, a law that is pure
and divine.  Consequently, the judgment-the reason —the intellect of man-must be correspondingly divine; and therefore whatever it can not sanction, the Divine Mind never created.
The account given of the birth of Jesus by Matthew does not indicate any intention on the part of Joseph and Mary to have it understood and believed that he was the legitimate Son of the Deity, thus
deposited and developed in a material form, as is claimed by theologvians.  If this account of the birth was to be the basis upon which
all evidence should rest, of tile Divine incarnation, then would Joseph

have proclaimed these facts in a tangible form to the world, as also
would Mary have proclaimed her absolute knowledge of the same;
and this would have established the truth in the minds of many who
dwelt within the neighborhood where the occurrence took place.
This knowledge would not have been withholden fiom the world for
the space of many months, while the actual indication of the conception existed, during which time thousands of testimonies would
have transpired to produce universal conviction and knowledge.
~ 132. IMatthew, after having related the account as he received it
traditionally, closes by saying — "And all this was done that the
prophecy of Esaias might be fulfilled, saying,' A virgin shall conceive
and bear a son.'"  This passage is entirely disconnected from the
subject on which Matthew was speaking, and can not possibly be
made to represent an intention on the part of Isaiah to prophecy
concerning this circumstance, nor as in any way affirming its truth, although the occurrence is said to be a fulfilment of the prophecy.
Again, such a Divine manifestation of original design, would not
have been inculcated by an appeal to such superficial evidence as
proving a foreknowledge of the occurrence, or as dernonstrating
its accomplishment.  This quotation is entirely derived from  the
seventh chapter and fourteenth verse of Isaiah, and is used for a
purpose for which it was manifestly not designed.  It is well to
understand the origin of this expression in Isaiah, and thus to see
how utterly disconnected the passage is with the circumstance related
by Matthew. After the death of Solomon, the Jewish nation became
divided into two kingdoms or monarchies.  The kingdom of Juda
possessed Jerusalem  as its centre and capital, and at the time this
passage was written, Ahaz was their king.  The other nation was
called the kingdom of Israel, whose capital was in Samaria, and Pekah
was at this time their king.  The nation of Juda followed the line
of David, but the nation of Israel that of Saul.  At this time, also,
Resin was the king of Syria. Pekah and Resin fought many battles
against each other, each, meanwhile, entertaining hostile intentions
toward Ahaz and his kingdom, which was then at peace. Subsequently, Resin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, joined
their armies and marched into the kingdom of Juda, against Ahaz.
Isaiah (according to previous delineation) was generally beloved
because of his strong social affections, and for the abundant sympathy

afflictions, of whom he was a general consoler. Being a resident of the city of Jerusalem, and possessing much popularity, he
was requested by King Ahaz to come and prophesy concerning the
result of his anticipated contention with the two kingdoms that were
then against him.  After having some conversation with Isaiah, he
called for a sign as evidence of the truth of Tsaiah's prophecy; to
which the latter said, " Behold, a virgin is* with child, and beareth a
son.  Butter and honey shall he eat, and before he shall know to
refuse the evil and choose the good, these kingdoms shall be relieved
of both their Icings."
According to biblical chronology it was over seven hundred years
after this prophecy that the birth of Christ related by Matthew took
place. But, as has been shown by previous remarks, the signifier
must precede the thing signified, or else there is no signification.
Therefore, if Isaiah had reference to the birth of Christ, then the sign
was no evidence nor signification to Ahaz, inasmuch as it happened
after the thing to be signified. It is plain that Isaiah had no such reference; and it is not right to look upon such sperficial evidence as
sustaining that which has been supposed by commentators to be of
divine origin and design.  When Isaiah prophesied concerning the
establishment of the kingdom of peace, and the growth of the Tree
of Righteousness, lie employed general and unlimited expressions.
He presented no sign, with the exception of those signs existing in
the tendency of things, and in the nature of his interior promptings
and intuitions.
Nothing could be so much against the characterand dignity of any
individual as such unjust and unrighteous accounts as are given concerning the birth and life of Jesus.  Such things as are related are
indeed derogatory to the purity and refineriment of the character of
this personage, in the minds of those who reflect understandingly.
The account also derogates from the character of the Divine Mind,
and removes firom himn his celestial dignity.
Matthew proceeds to relate an account concerning a star that was
seen in the east by the wise men who came from the east to Jerusalem; and these were instructed by Herod to go and search out
the residence of the child, that he, with them, might go and worship
him.  He relates that they followed the star, which was a silent
indicator of the place where the child was., The speaker incidentally remarked, in conversation, that the present tense was
empxu ti Dy Isaiah.

It is well to remark, that it is not easy to behold a star in the
daytime, nor is it probable that any solar system could be so disconcerted, or its movements so deranged, as that a star belonging
to it could perform  the office of a messenger.  This account,
however, is only related as a traditional impression received by
Matthew.
After the wise men found the child, they presented beautiful gifts
of gold, myrrh, and frankincense, and departed, by interior direction,
to another portion of the land that they might not be compelled to.
inform Herod of the child's locality.
Again, it is said that Joseph dreamed, and by impressions thus
received, was led to depart, with his wife and child, into Egypt. It
is well, however, to remark, that Herod's proclamation to put to
death all the male children, was generally circulated before Joseph
departed into Egypt; and it does not evince much capacity of
discernment for a man under any perilous circumstances, to rest
when in danger until prompted by a dream to escape.
They departed into Egypt, and remained there until the death oa
Herod. This Matthew endeavors to confirm by quoting a passagefirom tile eleventh chapter of Hosea and first verse. It is only necessary to read the passage quoted to discover its non-allusion, to that
to whicih it is here applied, and the uselessness of the application.. Itwill be seen that the chronology of Matthew, and his account givet.
of the dleath of Herod, contradict entirely the record of the same circumstance in the book of Luke.  For Luke in the third, chapter and,
twenty-third verse, says that "Jesus began to be about thirty years of
age" before lie began to preach, " being as was supposed the son of
Joseph;" and afterward, viz., in the thirteenth chapter, and thirty-first'
verse, lie relates that one came to Jesus and. said, "Get thee out and;
depart hlence, for Herod will kill thee."  The language wihich follows is exceedingly unlike the kind spirit of!Jesus. He is. repre —
sented as calling Herod a fox, and sending a message which could.
not hlave been prompted by his refined soul.  Thus, Luke represents Jesus as being thirty years of age before he began to preach
andl that at that time Herod sought. his life: while Matthew relates.
that Herod died before he returned from Egypt.  This discrepancy
has been overcome by commentators, by referring Luke's account to at
king who succeeded Herod, of the same name. But evidence of thei
independent origin of the two accounts is not derived from any rel? —
able profane or ecclesiastical history, inasmuchl as these manllscripti.

were uncollected and uncompiled for more than three hundred years
after the birth and life of Jesus.
~ 133. Matthew then proceeds to speak of the prophecy in the
book of Hosea, eleventh chapter, first verse, which says, " out of
Egypt have I called my Son."  This passage has no signification except in connexion with the verses preceding and following it.
Then, again, in connexion with the account of Herod's putting to
death all the male children, he quotes from the thirty-first chapter of
Jeremiah and fifteenth verse, which says: " In Rama a voice was;eard, weeping and lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children,
and would not be comforted, because they were not."  It will be
remembered that Jeremiah was a pathetic describer of suffering, and
a sympathizer with those who were of his brethren and nation, and
also that he himself suffered many afflictions, of which his lamentat.ions evidently bear testimony.  This passage is derived from  one
of his pathetic strains while meditating upon a subject sustaining no
connexion whatever with the destruction of the children by Herod.
Then, again, Matthew  speaks in connexion with the return of
Joseph from Egypt, and his going to the city of Nazareth, saying
that this was done " that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, He shall be called a Nazarene." (Matt. ii. 23.)  At the
time this passage was recorded, this expression existed in one book
of the Psalms, but this was subsequently voted uncanonical; and
hence at the present time there is no such book in the Bible.
Further on (chap. viii. 16, 17), there is a quotation fiom the prophecies of Isaiah, fifty-third chapter, fourth verse, which Matthew cites
in connexion with the healing of the sick and casting out of devils,
saying that " himself tookl our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.".This is in no way applicable to the doings of Jesus in casting out devils and healinog the sick; for notwithstanding Isaiah mentions no name,
this remarks are distinctly and only applicable to the sufferings and
afflictions of one Jeremiah, who lived at the time this was written.*
Although the allusion is indefinite and obscure, yet it is decidedly to
him that the passage alludes.  It could not have applied to Jesus or
his kind and gentle treatment of the sick and diseased; for lie neither
*In answer to a question, the clairvoyant informed us that this Jeremiah was a:friend and associate of Isaiah, was a man of very amiable disposition, and a general
-sympathizer with human suffering- but still, from various causes, was subjected to:-cseeutions and afflictions.

took upon himself their infirmities nor bore their sicknesses, but was
merely active in reliteving persons of those afflictions which neither
they, himself, nor any other person afterward, possessed.
Matthew also quotes a prophecy as referring to Christ's dwelling
in Capernaurn.*  This, again, upon examination, appears to bear no
distinct evidence of being intended for the purpose for which it is
employed by Matthew.
Again, Matthew relates that Peter drew his sword and cut off an
ear of one of the higlh-priest's followers.  He was commanded to
desist from any defence, and permit the enemies of Jesus to proceed
in their own way, that another prophecy in the Scriptures might be
fulfilled (Matt. xxvi. 51, 56).  But the verification is not discoverable in any prophecy, when the same is duly analyzed. Neither is it
just to associate the deeds of charity, purity, and benevolence, performed by Peter, with such an act as is here ascribed to llim; for
Peter was a mucll-engaged disciple of the great Reformer.  Swords,
and their use, have no possible connexion with charity, purity, and
righteousness.
Again: a quotation fiomn Zechariah (xi. 12, 13) is made to refer to
the thirty pieces of silver with which a potter's-field was bought for
the burial of strangers (Matt. xxvii. 5, 9)., This, however, is not the
intention of the original text, where the whole account is distinctly
given as having no reference to a potter's-field, but merely to a
potter:  while Matthew mnakes the account affirm the thirty pieces of
silver in possession of Judas to have been expended for a potter'sfield.
He also (chap. xxi. 1-5) relates the account of Jesus riding into
Jerusalem upon an ass as fulfilling another prophecy (in Zechariah
ix. 9).  Commentators have supposed that this was an act evincing
the gentleness and humility of the character of Jesus.  But there
exists no manifest reason for this conclusion, inasmuch as asses were
thle animals usually employed for such purposes, and camels and
dromedaries were engaged in more oppressive labors.
Then, again, lie quotes (chap. xxvii. 35) firom the prophecies (Ps.
xxii. 18) in speaking of the casting of lots for the garments of Jesus,
in order to determine to whom  they should belong.  This can not
sustain or confirm this prophecy; neither can the allusion or the quotation be of any use in proving prior knowledge of the occurrence'Matthew iv. 15, 16, as taken from Isaiah ix. 1, 2.





## p. 500 (#528) ############################################


5-00           NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
for the casting of Pots for garments in similar cases was a universal',ustom of those days.
In all, Matthew makes twelve quotations from  the prophecies of
the Old Testament, each of which is as disconnected from the subject to elucidate which it was quoted, as the birth of Christ was disconnected from the fact that the kingdom of Ahaz should not be invaded or overthrown.  These are collateral and abstract sentences
contained in various books of the Old Testament, from which, if disconnected, they have no signification. And it must be indeed unriglhteous for any history, record, or system, to urge such superficial
and evanescent evidences to sustain it.  And nothing can convey
stronger and more unequivocal evidence against any system, history,
or alleged occurrence, than the discovery that it is sustained by a
number of superficial and merely-apparent proofs, all of whicll, when
analyzed, are not worthy the serious reflection of any mind, to say
nothing of the character of that Divine Being who rules omnipotent
in higher spheres. I find no allusion in the Old Testament to any
isolated circumstance that happened at the birth or during the life of
Jesus.  And even if those passages quoted by Matthew appear in
their form of expression applicable to any circumstance that did occur,
this does not prove that they are divine or genuine.  For these occurrences recorded by Matthew were minor and isolated circumstances,
having no connexion with general law, and could not therefore have
been truthfully foretold by any person receiving interior or divine instruction. To understand the force and application of former remarks upon the probabilities of truthful prophecy, it would be well
to compare the superficial quotations made by Matthew, with the explanation which has been given of the nature and province of all
prophecy or interior instruction.
~ 134. Having briefly spoken concerning the superficial evidences
accumulated by Matthew to verify his traditional history, I will now
proceed to speak of the origin of many important doctrines, at least
esteemed as such by theologians, as derived from  the book of Matthew.  This book contains many sayings which it is righteous and
profitable to analyze and explain, these holding, as they do, a close
relation to real, transpiring facts, from which the materials of the
record have been superficially collected.
Matthew proceeds to relate, in a promiscuously historical manner,
the selection of the apostles who were to follow Jesus and assist his

workings,- and also to promulgate his existence, character, and teachings, to various nations of the earth. He also gives an account concerning the sermon that was preached upon the mount, the influence
it had upon the auditors, the observations which the multitude made
upon its prominent features, and concerning the principles therein
inculcated.  He also relates the prophecy of Jesus concerning the
destrlction of Jerusalem, and the end of that era, age, world, or dispensation.  On the question as to the origin and truth of these relations, I am not at the present time intending to speak; but the object
is to analyze some of the most prominent theological speculations that
have been based upon this merely-historical narrative of Matthew.
The first of these is the opinion concerning the use and intention
of the birth and teachings of CHRIST.  It has been supposed that he
was a designed instrument, possessing in spirit the Divine qualities'of the Creator, to redeem the race from a low degree of physical
wretchedness and spiritual death, so that they might thus be restored
to a position they once occupied, and become subjects of the favor
and goodness of the Divine Mind.
This speculation is founded upon the assumption that man at one
time was pure and unsophisticated, and far more advanced in physical
and intellectual attainment, than at the present period.  It is plain
that this is founded upon a very equivocal and unwarrantable basis,
because it is strictly mythological —an opinion that arose from the
early conception of the origin of evil.  It was entirely imaginary, and
was Landed down through each succeeding generation, undergoing
successive modifications, until it was historically introduced into the
Old Testament. from which it has been extensively disseminated by
~theologians.  Moreover, the belief in such a defect in the human race
— in such an absolute retrogression —is a virtual denial of the superior harmony of Creation, and of the perfection and the universal
knowledge of the Divine Cause; and the Deity is thereby charged
with a want of Wisdom-with an incompetency to produce an E/fecz
(which is the Universe) corresponding to himself, who is the Cause.
From this, it is made unequivocally evident that this speculation concerniiig the design of Christ's advent is only attributable to the fertile
imaginations of those who confined their spiritual and natural observations to the superficial inconsistencies consequent on human
existence.
Again, it is supposed that Jesus came to inform the race of principle. never before taught, by and from which mankind might be reUJ0                             Z3~ I~~1 ~~I~I~U ~~

stored to primitive innocence and spiritual perfection.  This is a
proposition equally unfounded: for it can not be proved from his
teachings, or from any ecclesiastical history, that any principles were
by him promulgated that had not an existence in the minds of many
enlightened men in previous ages.  Furthermore, this is giving him
power to create that which could not be created, and of unfolding
that which had no connexion with the nature and constitution of man,
nor even witlh the pre-knowledge of the Great Positive Mind.  If he
came to teach that the gerin of whlich was never before deposited in
the hunian mind, then would his teachings have been unprofitable
and beyond the possibility of any human practice. If they were newdisconnected from the teacllings of Naturc —then would man be incapable of conceiving of their importance, because they would have
no affinity witll any principles dwelling in his constitution.
Again: it is supposed that he came to be and act as a mediator
L)etween the Divine Mind and his children.  That is, to be a creator
of a mutual affinity, such as might join together the universal creations and their Creator! to form a connexion between Cause and
Effect, so that a relation might exist between them which never had
before existed!  If he was designed as a mediator, then he was entirely incapable of performing the office for which lhe was set apart.
For how is it possible for a medium to be added to any alraedy-united
system, the relations of which are the relations of Cause and Effect'!'lhis proposition is also superficially founded; and its tendency is to
destroy in the mindlthe order and uniformity of the vast creations of
the Universe, ALL of which sprang spontaneously firom an inconceivable VORTEX by the impulse of an ETERNAL CAUSE.
The belief that Christ was to be a medium, by and throughl which
man might ultimlately ascend to higher spheres, is a belief which is
most unrighllteous, and has a tendency to create hostility, exclusive
sectarianism, and presumptive arrogance.  It elevates one person.above another, and tends to establish exclusive privileges.  It tends
to impress deeply upon the uninformed of mankind that they are by
nature exceedingly sinful, depraved, and despised of Him who is
called their Creator.  It breathes envy, bigotry, and superstition, into
the heart of man, into the bosom  of society, and almost causes the
human judgment to sanction the same.  It is a belief that depreciates the constitution of Nature, of man, and of his spiritual principles,
together with that CAUSE who breathed them  all into being.  It is
indeed a belief unworthy the human affections; it is too unholy te

be entertained even by the uncivilized of the earth; it should be
banished from  the world for ever, because it is destructive to a
proper knowledge of the cause of human existence, of the characteristics of man, of his spiritual possessions, and of his immortal
destinaltion.
~ 135. Again: it is supposed that Jesus came to bring life and
immortality to lighllt; and that by revealing these to man, and employing nleans to produce conviction of their truth, the race became
instructed, and thus knew of spiritual life and an immortal existence.
r'lThis proposition can not be legitimately derived from the New Testatnent; for there it stands as a mere incidental and impassioned remark,
and not as designating an important feature in the nature of Cllrist's
rmission.  If the revealment of this truth was the inrtention, and Christ
was the means employed for that purpose, then the means has been
inadequate to the end; for life and immortality are neither demonstrated, nor clearly taught in any of the books, either of the New or
Old Testament.  A  conviction of life and ilnmmortality flows only
from a knowledge of the nature and constitution of matter, and of the
Divine Essence which animates it and all forms in being: also from
the spontaneous teachings of the Spirit, and the corresponding sanctions of Nature, of the Divine Mind, and of the immutable principles
which control and make of the Universe a perfect and harmlonious
Whole.  He~did not unfold the knowledge of these things; and
therefore it can not be truthfully said that lie was designed to bring
life and immortality to light.  Besides this, the doctrine of inmmortality and a belief in spiritual life existed in the world long before
either the New or the Old Testament was written.
Then it might be argued that he came to confirm  and develop that
which had already been implanted in the human mind.  Even this
can not be true: for he neither confirmed nor developed the previous convictions of men on this subject: nor have the teaclhings of
any portion of the Bible done this; but instead thereof they have, as
interpreted, drawn a d.arkg   ng mantle between the natural yearnings
of the spirit and the blooming beauty of the celestial home.  The
Bible has even darkened the pathway that once was illumined by the
spiritual promptings of mankind.  It has obstructed the progress of
physical and spiritual development, and has therefore operated against
its alleged design, which was to inform man of the relations of his
present existence, and to illustrate and demonstrate future and im

U04             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
mortal life.  It has failed to do this, and hence the proposition under
review is more a child of the imagination than of the properly-unfolded
human spirit.
Again: it is supposed that Christ was designed as -a medium by
and through whom man might escape eternal condemnation.  This
is, indeed, an opinion not transcending the theology of tl)a early
inhabitants.  And what is more notorious still, is, that it is helieved,
and flourishes to the greatest extent, where folly, ignorance, and superstition, exist in abundance.  It is no less notorious that as the
human mind discards preconlceived opinions, and becomes intelligent, this horrible and unrighteous dogma recedes; and it is as far
from an enlightened judgment, as intelligence is fiom ignorance.  It
originated in darkness-it develops darkness-and is itself so exceedingly (lark, that it can not approach the serene and brilliant light
that surrounds the throne of an enlightened reason.  Men hlave been
led to believe in the existence of an ocean of unceasing flame, where
one wave of fire succeeds another, sustained by the fnuel of discarded
and condemned human spirits, whose sufferings would add to the
glory and majesty of the Divine Mind, wlio, with all cornplac(ency,
receives the perfutmes thereof, as the fiagrance from an open flower!
By him this burning abyss is thoulght to lhave been created  and1 that
fiom him also proceed the fiery darts aimed by the omlnipotent vengeance, of dark and terrible damnation.  Indeed, it is supposed tllat
he is the great Fire Kindler, and that lhe fans the flames by lhis own
breath, and consumes innumerable spirits of his own creation, in the
bosom  of that terrible gulf, that ehas so divinely and so jrlncperly
originated!
There is no truth, nor can it be said that tlhere is one particle of
pure thotght, in tile proposition thlat Christ came to pay a (iebt that
mankind contracted.  If this were true, then even the fiery gulf
supposed to have been created, would be ultimately robbed of its
possessions; and thus the Creator would be involved in tlhe charge
of instituting that which is absolutely useless, and, consequently, in
the charge of absolute imperfection.  As this popular alnd imaginative belief originated in the very bosom  of darkness, ignorance, and
imbecility, it is not proper to dwell upon its hideousness anl1d absurdity, because it will die in the habitation of its birth, and thus be
sacrificed on the altar of pure Reason and Intelligence.
Christ, in foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem, according to
the record of Matthew, made use of manyv metaphorical illustrations





## p. 505 (#533) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   505
and expressions to elucidate the subject on which he was prophesying.  He makes use of heathen parables and fearful illustrations,
because these were in use, and his hearers could comprehend their
meaning.  This is conclusive evidence that his auditors were not far
beyond the superstitious theology of previous and long-forgotten
ages.  He makes use of the terms L"hell," "ancels," "darkness,"
"'weeping  and gnashing of teethl," " ye cursed," "ilthe undying
worm," "the fire that is not quenched," and in connexion with punishmlent, uses the word "for ever," "everlasting," etc.  These were
customary phrases, and were sometimes applied to the great abyss
of which the Sun was a representative.  At other times they were
applied to darkness, death, grave, pain, wretchedness, and a valley
near Jerusalem  which was used emblematically to represent filth,
loathsomeness, disease, perpetual pain, death, and evil spirits or
actions.  The term sheol was synonymous, originally, with the first
of these expressions; and hr(des is a Greek term of the same signification.  Gehenna is an entirely insignificant term, and is a total corruption of two disconnected words.  It is derived fiorm  Gai, the
name of the valley near Jerusalem, and Hininom, its owner.  Thus
joined, it forms in the Greek, gehenna; and it is, therefore, a word
whose origin is as corrupt as the valley which suggested it, and as
that imaginary abyss (hell) to which it is applied at the present day.
Those who urge the antiquity of a belief in hell in proof of its
sacredness and truth, should pause one moment and reflect, that the
further research is made into the depths of antiquity, the deeper and
darker grows the folly, ignorance, superstition, and imbecility, of the
human mind as then existing.  And it may well be said that this
doctrine is of so great an age, that it defies all skepticism  on that
score, and all inv6stigation as to its origin. It is not in the least degree
surprising, that such a doctrine should be of so early a birth, inasInuch as all the most repulsive superstitions originated about the same
time, and have existed from the remotest periods of national antiquity.
More developed and consistent views, which originated only in the
pure teaching of the judgment, are not regarded witil the same veneration, nor as being equally sacred, because they have so recently
commenced their destructive work against all long-established superstitions and crude theological systems.
Cllrist, then, in dealing so extensively in oriental allegories, and
the customary expressions of those days, has been understood as
teaching this doctrine; and it is supposed that the inculcation of this

506            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
constituted a part of his peculiar mission to mankind. Notwithstanding the terms which he used were originally applied to an actual
abyss of burning flame, and are in some instances thus applied in the
Bible, the doctrine is as false as the superstition of generations past.
Indeed it is so obviously and absolutely inconsistent, that the enliglltened judgment can scarcely conceive of so gross a belief having
an actual existence.
Here, then, is another theological proposition based upon mere
in a gination, and for which there is no rational foundation.
~ 136. Tlleologians are in the habit of manufacturing most ingenious and cunningly-devised creeds, and of claiming thenm to be
foundlel on the Bible.  These are put forth to the world, accompanied with most severe and imperative demands that they should be
believed.  To enforce these demands, theologians will quote a passage fiom tilhe New Testament which says: "He that believeth and
is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be
damnel."  Thllis policy somewhat resembles that of Matthlew, who
labored to confirm the truthfulness of his record by quoting promiscuously fr'om the prophecies.
People of many nations will bow in silence when their'potentate
exclaims, " I am your king."  Others will tremble when their king
exclaims, "You shall be beheaded."  The lMedes and Persians
shudder whien recurrence is made to the imrnutable laws and requirements derived fiom the Zend Avesta.  The Clhinese are in a similar state of fear, bolldage, and depression.  The Hindoos will fall
and worship the Shaster, and will greatly tremble as the Brllahmin
points to it, and then to a flash of vivid lightning, in enforcing faith
and submission.  And what is still more to be regretted is, that the
whole Christian world can be made to tremble, and to discard the
dictates of their judgment, and almost to renounce proprietorship
over their own persons, when the theological teacher points to the
Bible and exclaims, " He ti/at belicetlh not shall be damned!"  It is
to be deeply lamented, even unto tears, that a portion of the world
should be thus called Chtristianized, while public teachers are examples of folly, ignorance, and fanaticism, unworthy of an existence in
the nineteenth century.
Thus an evanescent and unreal theology is in the world, because
men have been so situated and influenced as to become superficial
expounders and commentators.  These men are indeed most uri




## p. 507 (#535) ############################################

justly called theologians; for it is absolutely demonstrated that the
Universe or Nature, is the Great Revelation of tlle Divine Mhind, and
is the universal and eternal Expounder, Commentator, and Preacher.
In order that a man may be properly termed a theologian, he should
take his text in the universal book of Nature; and his sanctuary
should be the expanded earth, and the unfolded heavens.
From the foregoing considerations, it is made evident that not one
of' these propositiolns concerning the mission of Christ, can possibly
have the least foundation in truth.  The universal testimonies of
Nature and her laws, justify any strength of assertion to this effect.
Again: it is said tlhat Christ had a Divine commission, to prove and
establish which, he perforhmed many incomprehensible miracles.  How
such an opinion can be derived from  the literal teachings of the New
Testa!nent, it is implossible to conceive; for altlouglh Matthew and
the apostles seriously believed in the miracles, they have not in all
hleir writings intimate(l tlhat these were designed as a confirmation of
Chr'ist's mission, nor do they represent him as ever malking any such
a declaration.
Matthew relates some miracles tlat were performed by Christ after
lescending from the mount, and while travelling throlgh various portions of the land.  It is well to mark the reading of those records.
Tlhose miracles would apparently never have been performed, had
not Christ been earnestly solicited by those desiring- relief and assistance.  He is represented as rewarding, their faith and confidence in
hirn by cornmplying with their desires.  But if the miracles had ever
been designed as a mneans by which the exalted character of his mission might be demonstrated, then would they have been performed
under different circumstances, and at other tines besides when he
was prompted by his own sympathy for the suffering, and by their
earnest solicitations for relief.
So far, then, biblical interpretation has transcended the meaning
of the expressions interpreted, and is therefore void of all proper and
truthful suggestion, and has its foundation only in imagination and
misconception.
Again: it is said that no system of religion is sustained by miracles,
with the exception of that found in the Bible.  This is not true.
Mohammed, who wrote the Koran, appeals to the authority of miracles to establish a belief in his revelation-miracles, too, which he
says he  himself performed.  He says that he was transfigured, and

thus passed through ninety heavens in one night —had a long conversation with the Deity, and returned again to the earth early on the
subsequent morning!  Surely," a greater miracle than this has never
been recorded.  Zoroaster also constantly appealed to the marvellous faculty of the hun;an mind for credence in relation to his very
strange and miraculous conversation with the gods.  Moreover, the
doctrines of miracles, like the doctrine of endless suffering and condemnation, can boast of a very early origin; and hence the claims of
theologians, as based upon this ground, are worthy of at least as much
veneration, because of their antiquated birth.
Again: it is said that miracles were not only intended to demonstrate and establish the Divine commission of Jesus, but also to establish incontrovertibly the Christian system of theology, and that his
mission and the Bible were established by su2pernatural evidences and
manifestations.  Thus the miracles are considered works accomplished by supernatural potency.  It is perfectly clear that nothing
is, and nothing can be, but the Divine Mind, which is the Cause, and
the Universe, which is the Effect.  Cause and Effect thus un1iting and
harrnonizingo in one sole System, it follows that whatever occurs in
any of the innumerable departments of the Universe, must occur because it is caused by a natural instigation.  Nothing, therefore, can
occur in the vast empire of universal creation opposed to, or transcending, the principles of Nature.  All things, then, whether organized or unorganized, developed or undeveloped, must be strictly and
unequivocally NATURAL.  If anything, therefore, transcends Nature
or the natural movements of the Universe, it must be an effect of absolutely nzot/ling.  The term sup)crnatural, then, indicating something
above Nature, is a solecism; and nothing is more distinct than the
untruth of the theological proposition that miracles were accomplished
by supernatural power: for that is clearly teaching that they originated friom nothing, and consequently never existed.  It is indeed remarkable that any system  of religion could have been so effectually
established by manifestations in evidence of its truth, caused by an
Omnipotent NOTHING!  On the other hand, it would indeed be a
miracle if such systems of belief did not exist where folly and ignorance universally prevail, and where have existed circumstances favorable to the development of so many superstitious ideas.
~ 137. Again, it is alleged that the apostles were selected to witness these miraculous displays, and to communicate the facts to the

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 609
world.  This, it is supposed, they would truthfully do, because they
were good and disinterested men.  This is a proposition scarcely
worthy of comment.  If these apostles were chosen, did they not become at once deeply interested?  And if they were such good and
righteous men as they are represented to have been, would they not
have been so pure and harmless in disposition as not to carry with
them swords? for it is plain to every mind that swords and goodness
have not a very close affinity.  And what prevented Peter, when he
drew his sword and cut off an ear of the servant of the high-priest,
from cutting off his head also, is not clearly explained.  It is plain
that whatever spirit prompted the first act, could have severed the
head with as little coml)punction.
If the apostles were chosen to communicate the knowledge of
those miracles and the teachings of Christ to the world, would they
not have drawn up a voluminous account of the miracles performed,
such as would have flowed through all the channels of the Christian
dispensation?  And would not this account stand at the present day
as a monumental evidence of a Divine intention as connected with
the display; of the absolute truth of the Christian religion, and also
of the unequivocal knowledge of those who were eye-witnesses of
the things related?  Instead of this, they make no announcement of
any such intention of Christ, or of any such conviction in their
own minds.  In their writings in the New Testament, they relate the
miracles as being acts merely incidental to their journeyings; and
those performed by Christ were not regarded by any of the apostles,
nor by Christ himself, in any other light than as promiscuous and
incidental occurrences of his life.
Matthew was certainly not capable of being an eye-witness to those
miraculous works of which he speaks, because he was an officer under the Roman government many years after the death of Jesus, and
did not become an apostle until le was greatly advanced in life. He
then only wrote a few accounts, and at last died a martyr in Persia.
Ecclesiastical historians have striven to make it appear that he wrote
the first chapters in the book ascribed to him; but they have failed,
merely because it is not true.  Besides this, no information is given
of Matthew by any historian who lived in those (lays, because he
deserted the Jewish and adopted the Christian religion in the latter
part of his life, and did not become in any degree popular, except
from the fact that he suffered martyrdom under the government of
Persia.

510             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Then the proposition under review can not be proved, either from
ecclesiastical or profane history.  Besides, this proposition was never
taught by Jesus, scarcely intimated by the apostles, and entirely disbelieved by the whole Jewish nation, who were in a condition to be
eye-witnesses of the occurrences; and if these had been convincing,
they would have been convinced.
Again: it is said that as the miracles were designed to confirm and
establish the Christian religion, and as they really were performed
and actually witnessed eighteen hundred years ago, it is absurd and
even unrighteous to entertain a suspicion concerning their original
intention or actual occurrence.  This proposition bears no evidence
of consistency, inasmuch as it arbitrarily demands universalJsuith. It
is impossible for the divine principle of reason to be convinced of
anything without a positive knowledge of some foundation whereon
its truth may rest.  Faith may exist as an evanescent conviction of
the afflctions; hIlt the jud'mocl t knows of no faith, no belief, but that
whiiel flows froin tile basis of absolute and unequivocal knowledge.'_Then in order to justify the demlllnd for universal faith in this proposition, equal evidence must be presented to every mind, in every age:
for otherwise mankind can not be convinced.
But the proposition as it stands is equivalent to saying, that, as the
sun gave lorth its light, heat, and fertilizing atmosphere, six thousand
years ago —at which time it ceased to shine; and as those who were
then living recorded that occurrence, together with a description of
all the fertility produced by the sun's congenial influence; therefore
man must beliere that it once shone; and then to him the productions
of the earth will continue the sa-ne.  This would be as consistent as
to demand faith of the human mind in a tling or occurrence which
all probabilities and possibilities, and the universal testimonies of Nature, are against.  It would be like calling upon man to enjoy the
light and heat of the sun now, because it was enjoyed six thousand
years ago; or to believe that the earth continues to be fertile, because
it was so when blessed by the smiles of the sun.  Belief in the miracles must cease with the cessation of the evidence-the same as the
earth would be rendered barren should the sun cease to shine.  An approval of the proposition under contemplation would be as impossible
to the enlightened judgment (because of the universal evidence against
it) as it would be to believe that the sun lhad been arrested in its
course, while Divine harmony continues to pervade, and join inseparably, all created things.

5 138. The miracles as recorded in the New Testament are ot
such a nature as only to create fear and marvellousness in the minds
of those who might witness them, and also in the minds of those who
hear or read the accounts of them.  They are not represented in a
manner becoming the object for 1which they are supposed to have
been intended, and are entirely void of all that high and celestial dignity which they would naturally be expected to possess if they were
of Divine origin.  Nothing can be more unjust than to interpret those
relations in the New Testament as hiaving an important bearing upon
the question as to the truth or falsity of Christ's Messiallhship; for
they are entirely destitute of those high and exalted manifestations
which are constantly and unvaryingly displayed in the mighty architecture of the Universe.  There exists in them no grand and elevated
principles —no intrinsic beauty or excellency which can or will have
any tendency to benefit or reorganize Mankind.  It is well to inquire
what possible good can arise fiom  a little experiment like that of
turning water into wine, or from  any of similar nature?  Besides
this, all who are acquainted with the chemical relations of substances,
and the laws of their combination, will at once conceive that such an
occurrence would be entirely opposed to those laws, and could not.
therefore, have taken place.
Another account is related of two men " possessed of devils" presenting themselves to Jesus for relief.  The devils are represented
as at that moment beseeching Christ to let them depart fiom the human form, and enter into a herd of swine at a short distance from
them.  Jesus is represented as granting their solicitation; and at
once they left the persons and entered into the swine   which, being
exceedingly deranged by this very unjust intrusion, ran over a steep
place, and were destroyed.  It appears from  this, that man in that
instance was but little superior in his nature and organization to these
animals whose lives were destroyed: for the " devils" would not have
desired to change their habitation thus immediately and directly from
the forms of the men to the forms of the swine, had not some close
relation existed between the two.  And there could not possibly have
been instituted a better and wiser plan to accomplish the destruction
of a multitude of such annoying and intrusive devils than the plan
here carried into execution.  For there exists no account whether
they evacuated the interior of the swine on their way down the precipice to the water, or whether they, with the swine, most effectually
"perished."  Certainly no one will presume to say that this is not

512            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
one of the most useful and iml)ortant miracles that is recorded in the
New Testament.
Further, this wonderful performance astonished and excited the
inhabitants of the place to such a degree, that they are represented as
persuading Jesus to depart out of their coast.  Indeed, nothing can
be more just and natural than this; for what man or community
would not apprehend a great deal of injury and injustice firom the
existence of a person among them so effectually engaged in destroying their herds?  It is a most happy reflection that this is a mere
record of Matthew, but was not an actual occurrence.
The character and tendency of the miracles related prohibit completely the possibility of their Divine intention as apprehended by
theologians, because they were exceedingly limited, and their use
was confined exclusively to the persons receiving such medical assistance as they afforded.  Such deeds of charity, sympathy, and
benevolence, are to be admired in the character of any person who
ever has lived or ever will live on earth; but further than this, they
are of no importance, and demand no veneration nor approbation.
For they are simply the good and just deeds which may be performed by any person who is naturally qualified for their accomplishment.
But there has arisen a vast amount of misapprehension concerning
these miracles, fiom the style of the written record.  Matthew, and
all the other apostles, record the cause and effect as occurring in rapid
succession —almost simultaneously.  Such expressions firequently
occur as —" He laid his hands upon him, and he was healed."
So in all the cases mentioned of palsy, lameness, blindness, deafness,
and other physical infirmities, cured by Jesus, the effect is related as
though it followed the cause immediately.  All who are acquainted
with physiological principles, and with the calm, gentle, and energetic movements of the human organization, are persuaded-even
positively convinced-that no cause can be brought to act so as to
produce health as an immediate result, in case of any established disease. Therefore, notwithstanding the things recorded were performed,
they were effected by causes agreeing with the nature of the human
system; and the re-establishment of health, whiclh actually occurred,
was effected gradually, and by means adapted to the temperament of
the individual, and the nature of the disease.
But Matthew and others have conveyed a wrong impression by
relating those circumstances in such an unqualified manner.  Their

form of expression was similar to saying, " Tile sun retired behind
the western hills, and all was involved in darkness;" or, " One applied such a medicine, and was cured;" or, " I deposited a germ
in the earth, and behold this beautiful tree!" or, " We sowed the
seed, and we gathered the harvest."  This would be leaving, as Matthew did, the intermediate period between cause and effect entirely
unnoticed, and recording the occurrence in general terms, and in a
comprehensive manner; and the same style of narrative is frequently
exemplified in the writings of the apostles.  I do not make this remark to relieve those passages of their inconsistency (though the
writers of them  evidently believed as they wrote), but merely for
the purpose of revealing the cause and origin of those expressions.
If thousands of such experiments were performed as the casting
out of devils, or transforming water into wine, or destroying the lives
of a number of undeserving swine, or the withering of a verdant figtree-what possible use-what grand design-what celestial result
would be accomplished?  Would not such means be altogether inadequate to the fulfilment of the end for which they are supposed tot
have been originally designed?  Are they not useless and insighiffcant manifestations, such as have a tendency to corrupt a just faith. in,
the workings of the Great Divine Mind? Are they not, indeed,.
most unworthy the dignity of any human being, to say notIin-g of the
GREAT CAUSE, which is the very Essence of Infinite Perfection?
Have they any tendency to extirpate evil from the earth?  It is distinctly evident that the race of mankind were not benefited when
they were performed, nor prevented from  subsequently becoming:
most unrighteously disorganized.  And have not the very existence
of those accounts caused war, persecution, martyrdom, and death?
Have they not divided nation from nation, by establishing an, antago —
nism in those personal and national interests which should unite.
them  as a brotherhood?  Nay, has not even, the. whole Christian
world, so called, been divided, and each person drawn the sword of'
sectarian hostility against another9.  Are these celestial effects, in-.

correspond?  If these things were designed to produce convxiction,
of the Messiahship of Christ,. could it have been possible for thee

and baffled?  And if they were designed to convince mankind, why:

614            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
It is distinctly clear, that they have produced precisely the effects
which might naturally have been expected from their operation upon
the minds of the superstitious and uneducated generation which so
earnestly believed them.  They were written under the promptings
of migutlided judgment; and having thus originated, their effects
have fuilly corresponded in every generation, even to the unfolding
and ripening of the human mind in the nineteenth century.
The theological propositions, founded upon the supposed performance of supernatural miracles, are so completely transparent, that the
discerningr mind can not fail to see their utter nothingness. And though
volume after volume has been written to elucidate these opinions
metaphlysically, I amn constrained to leave them all unnoticed, because
they appear to me as the shadows, and not the substance of things.
~ 139. I now proceed to an investigation of the fundamental and
essential principles of what is claimed to be a pure and celestial theology, or, rather, of the four pillars upon which the theological superstructure is sustained.  And I would bespeak particular attention to
this attack, because it may be that it will demolish the whole system,
andl leave nothing of it but a mass of disousting rubbishl.  The first
point is " Original Sin;" the second, "the Atonement;" the tllird,
"Faith;" and the fourth, "Regeneration."
1st. Original Sin.  To dissect this proposition in all its nurnerous forms and modifications, would be to interfere with that which is
Inot capable, because of its unsoundness, of receiving any interference.  But there is one principle involved in the subject, by which'the human mind has been most unjustly perverted, and this principle,demands a brief notice.  It represents man as being originally pure
*as to his physical and spiritual nature, even as a flower from the bud,of the divine creation; and that he possessed nearly all the charac-;teristics of a celestial being, pure, spotless, unsophisticated.  While
Sthus existing, temptations were placed before lim, of so captivating,a nature that he was unable to resist them.  Oh, how  unjust, to
charge the Divine Mind with creating man, and endowing him with
all the attributes of purity and goodness, and at the same time with-'holding  from himn a competency to resist temptation!  How unholy
to accuse him of constituting man a perfect being, and at the same
Ftime instituting a most destructive plot to injure him for life, and perilaps for ever! a plot, too, which would implicate an unborn race for;thousands of years.!





## p. 515 (#543) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 51b
Original sin, then, is based upon this grand but most unrighteous
impeachlnent of the Wisdom and Love of the Creator.  It assumes
that man was telmpted, that he yielded, and that spiritual death ensued; a death so terrible in its influence, that an unborn and innocent creation were necessarily involved in its inconceivable horrors!
Nay mnore it disconnects the whole world of mankind firom any
spiritual communication with that Holy Essence which breathed
them  into being-even totally banishes them  from  all parental
favor, and presses them  to the very brink of an awful burning
gulf! Still niore hlorrible, it teaches that millions on millions are,
owing to this divine curse, destined to writhe in the waves of darkness-in the bosoin of a burning abrss, whose dissolving fires were
blown into a flame by the very breath of- Dil;in  Love!
Thus, according to the doctrine under review, an innocent man,
who had no experience-  who was pure and undefiled-came under
the wrath and curse of that Being whose very essence is Love, Wisdom, and celestial Perfection.  In this his posterity are also unavoidably implicated, and thus are charged with a debt wlhich they
had no agency in contractin,, and which was incurred before they
were born!  Here is a most unjust and ilnpious charge; and the
proposition involving it is too corrupt and vitiating to the moral sensibilities of men, to have an existence even in the darkest recess of a
distorted imnagination.
This great debt, caused by spiritual death, the whole race is said
to owe to Him  who spoke, and they lived!  The Divile Mitnd is
said to have assumed the hlumtaf form, in which he calls himself tle
Son, for the purpose of relieving the race of this debt, which he himnself created -by living on earth, suffering all descriptions of persecution, and at last dying an ignominious death!  He himself thus
suffers innocently to remove effects that must have originated in his
own Intfinite Wisdom!  And this is called " THE ATONE.MENT."
All this is equivalent to saying that the Creator instituted a celestial
plan to deceive and implicate mankind, of which he subsequently
repented, and could not annihilate its awful consequences without his
Son -even himself- dying the death of a persecuted martyr!  Nature, retain thy complacency!  Continue to unfold thy charms!
Perpetuate thy undying beauty and grandeur, even though man in
his audacious folly, has clothed thee in a mantle of darkness, terrible
as the vengeance of an exasperated Deity!
Ye theologians, behold now your speculations!  Your ";' original

sin," is discovered to be a repulsive blasphemy; and your " atonement" to be the very climax of a deranged imagination, and one that
is of the most unrighteous and immoral character.  The first is diametrically opposed to all distributive justice - annihilates all conception of wisdom-banishes from the soul of man all appreciation of
celestial Love-dissipates all thirst for knowledge and progress —
and shuts the very portals of reason by the hand of omnipotent vengeance, and by pointing to a fount of infernal fires!  More terrible
darkness — a more soul-revolting conception — a more wretched display of human folly, could not possibly occur in any of the wide fields
and spheres of creation. The second proposition involves a charge of
injustice unworthy the deeds of and character of a heathen potentate.
Its tendency is to generate absolute immorality in the world, and so
far it is absolutely a curse to man.  But its deleterious power is
limited, for it can not arrest the sublime workings of established and
immutable LAWS.
The third essential element in the received theology, is called
Faith.  This, like many other alleged Christian virtues, is not capable of manifesting itself, nor is it even known to be existing until its
possessor verbally makes the fact known to the world. It is like
many Christian principles, so called, that are never manifested by
deeds or proper actions, but are only known to exist when the world
is told of them.
FAITH - what is it?  Certainly it is a conviction of the judgment,
resulting from  appropriate and adequate evidence.  Then it is an
effect derived from knowledge.  It is therefore void of all merit or
demerit, inasmuch as it is a natural consequence of known facts, and
not a voluntary acquirement of the mind.  Is it proper to call upon
man to believe an inconsistency in order that he may escape an irretrievable condemnation?  This, indeed, is the most unnatural derland that folly can possibly urge. Is a man to be approbated because he has faith in the existence of any external things received
through the channels of the senses?  Is it to be considered a merit
for a man to believe that the sun shines, and that the earth is rendered fertile thereby? or that the earth, together with the whole
solar system, revolves?  Is faith to be considered a merit, when it
is a result of a conviction of the judgment?  It is plain, then, that
the common religious requirement of faith is unjust, untrue, immoral
-because it is opposed to all laws of causation, and all teachings of
the interior and external world.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                517
The fourth point is Regeneration. This is founded upon the assumption of degeneration, and therefore the doctrine is only an evanescent and unreal effect, proceeding from a cause equally unreal and
unsubstantial.  Regeneration is considered as an effect resulting from;fiith; the latter results from —it is impossible to tell what!  And
it is entirely useless to dwell upon a term containing no interior
meaning, and which has generated, and will continue to do the same
unless abandoned, every species of superstition and unrighteous
thlouLghllts.
Such, then, are the substantial and inherent elements which constitute and sustain the great theological superstructure.  Their qualities are impure, their composition is decayed, they are performing
the work of their own destruction; and behold the temple falls: and
who shall stand, subsequent generations will testify.
~ 140. No class or series of expressions have been associated in
the enfeebled mind of man with more fear and depressing dread, than
some of those said to have been used by Christ while preaching and
prophesying.  It has been a source of wonder and extreme perplexity that a being represented as possessing so much spiritual refinement and brotherly kindness, should have employed such violent and
unkind terms in speaking of those who were merely opposed to the
doctrines he promulgated!  For it is plain to every pure, benevolent,
and philanthropic mind, that the mental constitution of that person
must be impure indeed, who could look abroad upon the face of creation and mark the weakness of erring humanity, and then say to his
own brethren-" Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers;" or, "' Ye
scribes and Pharisees-hypocrites!" for these were merely misdirected brethren, whose condition of mind was not caused by themselves, but by inferior and unpropitious circumstances.  The wellinformed mind is personally conscious that the causes of evil lie not
IN man, but ABOUT him.; and this knowledge at once creates a universal forgiveness, and forbids the application of any harsh terms to
a brother-much more to a brotherhood.  Persons who are not acquainted with the cause of moral evil, are in the habit of accusing each
other falsely, and applying to each other terms no less unjust than
such as, " Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape
the damnation of hell?"  Surely a more unrighteous sentence could
not proceed from an ignorant devotee of the Juggernaut!
If it is said that these expressions as ascribed to Christ have an

518             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
interior signification which is not discoverable upon the surface, then
still more should the language be discarded: for it no longer answers
the purpose for which it was designed.  If the expressions have a
meaning which is not perceptible, then should they not be uttered,
because they are, to say the least, entirely useless.
Perhaps no terms have oppressed the mind with more gloom and
dread than the terms "hell-fire," "everlasting fire prepared for the
devil and his angels," " weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth,"
&c.  It will be remembered that it is the expression, and not the
meaning,, which terrifies the weak and uninformed mind: for sheol
being a Hebrew word, has no specific application, but was used promiscuously among the early inhabitants in application to almost anything they disliked. And hlades is a Greek word applied in the same
way.  And as gehenna is a Greek word derived from  two Hebrew
expressions, it can not be truthfully said that either of these words is
worthy of the least regard, much less that they should be productive
of fear, and thus circumscribe the movements and lofty aspirations of
the human spirit.  I am deeply impressed, and that, too, by an influx
of superior information, that if these remarks will assist the efforts of
others to rend the dark curtain of superficiality fiorn off the windows
of the soul, one great and glorious achievement will be accomplished, and light will illuminate the spiritual possessions of every
human form.
A most remarkable and conspicuous personage, wlho may be considered as an inmate of this tlheological temple, I have not as yet
specifically noticed. I allude to the being called THE DEVIL. This
potent personage has been as active in establishing his portion of the
kingdom as any influence which we have as yet considered.  But it
is well to analyze the term "' devil," so that we may arrive at a more
familiar acquaintance with his origin and disposition.  This term is
synonymous with satan, which latter is derived from shaitan.  This
originally signified almost nothing, but was generally used in a loose
and unguarded manner, meaning spritely, godly man, deified spirit,
disease, monomania, evil-doer, &c.  All of these significations are
comprehended in various expressions in the Bible, such as satan,
death, devil, &c. But even in the Bible, devil signifies evil, wickedness, abomination.  And when this evil deity is represented as " going up and down the earth," or " going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour," the word " devil" is nothing more than a
figurative personification of evil.  As a proof of this, every discerning

person can see that he creates the most tumult and disturbance wlhere
ignorance and superstition abound to the greatest extent.
It is well known to biblical commentators, or at least to those who
have investigated the early application of terms, that tlhe ancient magicians deified an Evil Principle, and that their thlieology was systematized by Zoroaster, who possessed all the materials existing prior
to lils life, from whvich lhe erected his supernatural revelation.  As
the word s/hitlan nieant only a little more than nothing, certai Lly the
deified imaginary evil principle to whichl it is now applied can not
rean a grcat decal mnore.
But thle terms 1" hell," " devil," " satan," &c., have create(l more fear
an(i superstitious apprellension than any others contained in the whole
Primitive History.  But as has been shown, they were intended to
express only that which tile uncultivated inhabitants of the earth create(l by false conceptions of tile manifestations of Nature, and of the
chlaracter ar!l attributes of man.  Therefore they should be regarded
with at least as much respect as any oriental, poetical mythos, merely
because of the imaginative and marvellous conceptions which thley
exelnlll)ify.
Wbhile I am  speaking tlhus, I feel a constant and insuppressible
yearining for thle elevation of every mind to that degree of mental discernmesnt in wlich these tllings which I relate might be equally
known to tlhem, and equally discarded by thern.  This would be a
benefit to man, because lie would tlhen be restored to communion
with thle sublime teachings of hIis nature within, and of Nature without, the happy results of which would not only be experienced in the
present, but more perfectly in h;Iiher spheres.
It is also supposed by the majority of mankind, especially by those
acquainted with the teachings of the Old and New Testaments, that
the resurrection and general judgmcnt were never presented to tilhe
world before the life and disclosures of Jesus; and that the " golden
rule" was then for the first time promulgated by Jesus, and was never
conceived of or expressed by any previous mind.  That is not true.
It is well known to some who have explored the pages of antiquity,
that CONFUCIUS, the Chinese philosopher, expressed tile golden rule
nearly six hundred years before Christ lived-about which time
ZOROASTER also flourished, who succeeded in establishing thlroughout the whole eastern world the doctrine of a physical resurrection
and general judgment.  Zoroaster even prop'hesied, with a great deal
of perspicuity, in;genuity, and trutlhfilness.  Notwitllstandinlg hIis con

ceptions of a general resurrection and judgment were derived from
the many conceptions of earlier ages, they are presented in a more
systematic and rational form than those which are contained in the
New Testament, and which the apostles endeavored to promulgate
on tile authority of the teachings and martyrdom of Christ.
~ 141. Matthew, after having related the prophecy of Jesus concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and many other promiscuous
sayings, closes by giving a description of the trials, sufferings, condemnation, and crucifixion of Christ, who was a person of remarkalle excellence in all his physical and spiritual possessions.  But as
I shall speak concerning this subject hereafter, I dismiss it for the'
present, and proceed to notice some remarks of Matthew upon this
very unjust crucifixion.
He relates that Christ was exceedingly disliked by the Jewish nation, and that he was accused, arrested, and conveyed to the presence of Pontius Pilate-who was not over-anxious to condemn, but
was compelled by the vociferous multitude to yield his assent and
seal the condemnation.  After this, a cross was prepared, which Jesus was enforced to carry, and which he did with a great deal of
gentleness and humiliation, until lie arrived at the spot where his
noble and dignified person was to be sacrificed.  They placed a
crown of thorns upon his head, and gave him  impure and bitter
drink to quench his thirst; and what is still more to be lamented is,
that they nailed him to the cross, and then perforated his body with
their spears, that his sufferings night be increased, and their exasperation gratified!  He is represented to have had hut a few followers, and these came and wept beneath his body.
After he was taken fiom the cross and deposited in the sepulchre,
before whose Inouth a stone was placed, he is represented as being
guarded for three days, and then coming forth and appearing to three
of his disciples.  After this, lie was seen, it is said, by upward of
five hundred souls; and not long afterward he ascended amid the
clouds and disappeared, to occupy a position as Judge on higlh.
This, as it will be remembered, is recorded by Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John.  The record is not a demonstration of its actual
occurrence, although those who wrote were pure and undesigning
men, whose testimonies are worthy of the highest respect and consideration. I will explain hereafter how this opinion was created,
the causes enraged in nrodue;-'         -' 1- ay these persons wrote

with so much pure simplicity.  But at present I am only investigating the theological speculations based upon these records.
This martyrdom of Jesus is called the " Vicarious Atonement;"
that is, his suffering for the sins of the world-suffering an innocent
and ignominious death for that which his death could not alter, and
that which the Divine Creator is represented as having instituted!
Why should the Jews be persecuted for crucifying Jesus, if indeed
it was originally designed that the latter should thus suffer for the redemption of mankind?  The merit did not consist in his death inlependently, because he would not have been persecuted nor put to
death had not the Jews performed that office.  Then why not say
that the Jews were essential mneanls employed in the accomplishment
of this vicarious atonement? and why should the whole be ascribed
to the object sacrificed?  The Jews, however, are charged with exceeding cruelty, injustice, and unholy persecution.  They are accused in every possible way, and with a degree of virulence which
is much against their accusers; but how could they be guilty when
they were made agents of the Divine Mind to fulfil one of his original designs?  Then the Jews should receive a great share of the
adoration and praise: for it was by them that this great end was accomplished, and not so much by the sacrifice or vicarious atonement,
which was merely the effect of their united efforts.  Why, then, place
merit, adoration, and praise, where they do not belong?-for it is
manifestly unjust to adore and venerate an effect more than its cause.
But tile death of Christ had no possible connexion with the sins
of the world, nor with the cause of sin.  Sin, indeed, in the common
acceptation of that term, does not really exist; but what is called sin
is merely a misdirection of man's physical and spiritual powers, which
generates unhappy consequences.  The death of no being will extirpate these evil consequences.  Nothing short of a general knowledge of the causes of these evils, and of the general capabilities of
mnankind, will restore permanent hIarniony and happiness to tile race.
Nor is it possible for any principles involved in the idea of a vicarious atonement, to produce the work of general reorganization; but a
r.jection of this doctrine will be one of' the mightiest steps toward
ultimate amelioration and consequent happiness.
Further: there is no law governing any composition, that will admit of its ascension above the forms of Nature, before each part of
that composition becomes fitted for ascension.  Then the body of a
person can not be made to ascend while the law of association exists

522             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and governs Nature universally.  Nevertheless, it has been supposed
that the composition constituting the body of Christ might have undergone a process of refinement suitable to render an ascension possible.  But then it must have become completely intaingible, and
could not have been seen by those who were present at the ascension.  But this supposition is not founded upon a knowledge of general laws, or of their unvarying effects as manifested in every department of Nature.  Such an ascension would indeed lhave been impossible: because there could not have been such an accelerated
process of refinement as to perfect any composition in the space of
three days.
Moreover, the term  anastasis, rendered resurrection in the New
Testament, does not originally express any such an ascension.  It
there signifies a rising up, an elevation, a progressive reform, a resurrection, a gradual and steady improvement.  It may be added that
the doctrine of a general resurrection is founded only upon the supposition that the Bible teaches it, which it can not be proved to do;
nor is there any such meaning attached to the original expression
anastcisis.  It is well to remark, however, that Paul, who philosophized upon the subject, really believed in a general, corporeal resurrection.  Still, all his expressions, as well as those of the other
writers, will admit of a different signification; for terms have become
greatly modified since language has become so copious and superfluous, and therefore what they mean now is not always what they
meant originally.
Then, again, Mattlhew relates a most marvellous phenomenon concernincg the temple being rent, the earth quaking, graves openino-,
and their tenants being quickened into life, and appearing unto many
in the city.  (AMatt. xxvii. 51-53.)   This would not have been
believed for one moment, had it been related in any portion of the
Zend Avesta-although there are more remarkable things therein
recorded than this.  When such things are presented for credence,
it is always proper to reflect upon the probable origin of such relations-their use, if true, and then to inquire whether they are susceptible of an application. If these questions were urged with reference
to this account, its truth or untruth would not be regarded as of any
importance; for it is manifestly a confusion of the order of Nature,
and void of all practical utility.
As to a day of general Judgment, not much comment is required;
for it is neither taught in the Scriptures, nor believed by any biblical

investigator of a superiorly-enlightened mind.  A  remark heretofore
made, will answer instead of a protracted argument: " Whatever the
judgment can not sanction, the Divine Mind never created."
~ 142. As the book of Matthlew comprehends all that is related in
the succeeding books, I have given attention to its contents to the
exclusion, as yet, of all the collateral evidences found in the other
books for or against the propositions touched upon and analyzed.
But I will proceed to a general reflection upon each of these books, in
the order in which they are placed, speaking also of their origin and
prominent principles.  Before doing so, however, I will state a few
facts in the hlistory,of Mattliew.
Matthew became an officer under the Roman government some
time previous to the death of Christ, in which occupation lie continued for a long period, even until old age, at which time Paul, Dionysius, and others, were preaching the important doctrines of Christ.
Matthew deserted the Jewisil and embraced the Christian religion,
not long after Paul's conversion, and lie then soon began to write
concerning the things heard and seen as appertaining to Christ
and his teachings.  It will be seen by a review of his book, that
lie apparently grouped the sayings of Christ, not in the order
in which they occurred, but nmerely as they were presented to his
mind; for, in many places, lie evidently comprehends in one sentence an hlistorical account of tile miracles and sayings of Jesus which
seelninlly occupied many months.  Besides this, his manuscripts
have never been known to the world.  The only remains of them
are contained in a Greek manuscript.  But they were, as commentators admriit, originally written in Hebrew, and for the express use of
some Jewish converts.  Th'lere evidently existed no intention on his
part, nor on the part of those who transcribed his writings, to ever
have them merged into a canonical book.  Certainly lie was never
directed by Christ to write and present this manuscript to the world
for this purpose.  Nor can it be proved that he ever had such an
intention himself, either fiom the nature of his record, or fiom the
very unsatisfactory manner in which the same has been compiled,
received as canonical, and voted as tile first book of the New Testament.  Nothing could be more proper than the title of this book,
which designates it as "according to," though not as written by, Matthew. They who prefixed this title were themselves doubtful as to its
origin. Ecclesiastical history proves that its chronology is discrepar,





## p. 524 (#552) ############################################


524            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
with that of the preceding and subsequent writings; and very many
even admit that the first two chapters are exceedingly doubtful, while
none are very anxious to vouch for their truth.
After Matthew had written a few manuscripts, he was captured by
two officers of the Persian customs, carried to the governor, pronounced guilty of heterodoxy, and was condemned, and died a
martyr.
Some wise men have written profound criticisms upon the contents of the Old and New Testaments, and seem  to have mistaken
evidence to be against, rather than in favor of, the writings of the
apostles; especially where unguarded expressions occur, or quotations from the Old Testament, or historical relations which do in
reality oppose the records of other writers. The book of Mark contains many things that are discrepant with the contents of the book
of Matthew.  But this is no evidence that they intended imposition
upon the world.  Nor is it in any respect against the moral purity
and rectitude of their historical writings; but it rather manifests a
pure design in giving to the world that which they seriously believed,
and which was equally believed by others.  It proves that there
existed no designing plot —no collusion, whereby all things therein
related might be joined and confirmed in such a manner as to exclude
the possibility of detection and exposure.  It proves, also, that they
wrote merely fiom an influx of external impressions; and the reflux
of these gave rise to the manuscripts of the New Testament.  It
proves, also, that they wrote with an entire unacquaintance with each
other's private opinions or concurrent views; and that they wrote
free from any intention except that of presenting a pure and truthful
account.
~ 143. The book of MARK commences unlike that of Matthew;
for, instead of introducing a genealogy, it begins by quoting firom the
book of Malachi, third chapter and first verse, a prophecy concerning
one who would (and did) come to prepare the way for the introduction of the teachings of Christ to the world. It will be seen, by reading the quotation in Malachi, that it is in the first person, and has no
connexion whatever with the future.  But the expression is applicable to the fact that John preached and prepared the way for the introduction of the gospel.  Considered as a ln'ophecy, however, the
expression is not applicable.





## p. 525 (#553) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                525
This book contains fewer references to the prophecies than Mattn-w, and is confined particularly to a comprehensive relation of
many things which are also recorded in Matthew, and with a very
little dissimilarity.  TMark makes mention of the colt on which Jesus
rode to Jerusalem, adding to the account, what Matthew did not
mention, that it was a colt " upon whose back man never before sat,"
with the exception of this slight variation, which was supposed to
make the occurrence nearer a miracle than the simple relation of
Matthew, the two accounts coincide. He mentions, also, the casting
of lots, to ascertain who should possess the garments of Jesus. This,
also, is related differently from what we find it in Matthew. For Matthew, in connexion, makes a quotation, which he appears to have
considered as a confirmation of the idea concerning the preknowledge of the early writers.  Such quotations consist of incidental
expressions occurring in the Old Testament, having in all cases a
connexion with the historical events or circumstances referred to in
those books.
Mark then proceeds to quote firom the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah,
the words, "And he was numbered with the transgressors."  This
lie applies to the crucifixion of Christ with the two thieves.  It is
well to remember, again, that it was the expression which they quoted, and that in order to relate the circumstance in the language of
others, instead of employing their own-the same as one at the
present day would quote from the poetical, theological, or philosophical
productions of any previous writer, when passages are found which
are applicable, in order to embody or confirm his own reasonings or
impressions. If Mark and the other New Testament writers had
used the phrase, " that the expression might be verified," instead of,
"that the prophecy might be fulfilled," the reader would not be led
to believe so many unwarrantable ideas concerning the foreknowledge of those prophets.
The expression that occurs in Isaiah,' "He shall be numbered
with the transgressors," applies only to, and was originally intended
to represent, the sufferings and trials of Jeremiah.*  For although
he was a very affectionate and amiable man, and was -generally beloved, he was nevertheless numbered with the transgressors many
times, and was thus as often despised. It is true that Isaiah mentions
no name, but a careful reading will decide that the allusion was to something of this kind, though made in an indefinite and obscure manner.
*See note on page 498.

526             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
The book of Mark contains no distinct doctrines that are not contained in Matthew. It is written in a more condensed and perspicuous manner than the book of Matthew.  It is generally regarded
favorably for its brevity and plainness of historical and biographical
details.
The writer closes the book by relating a command given to the
apostles to go forth into all the world and preach the Gospel; and,
according to what follows, their testimony was to be offered to ihe
world on terms most severe and absolute.  It does not seem possible that any being possessing a very high degree of spiritual knowledge, could have uttered such a sentence as, "He that believeth not
shall be damned."  This declaration is contrary to the teachings of
all laws of cause and effect.  He who believes any principle, faith,
or phlilosophy, must believe it as the result of a deep and immovable
conviction of the judgment.  Certainly the mere fact of the apostles
preachin/g could not have been sufficient to produce such a faith as
was denmanded.  Faith could not be expected when there did not
exist sufficient cause to produce it.
Again: the re'ward for flith was to be a salvation -a saving, perhaps, firom sin, fiom skepticism, firom destruction by moral or physical death, or firom an abode of suffering and wretchedness.  Neither
of these is distinctly mentioned; but whether it was to be a salvation
fiom one or all of these calamities, it would be well to inquire, How
is it possible for faith, by any natural process, to produce such an
effect as is herein stated?  The effect of faith is merely a tranquillity of mind, firom which flow bright hopes and anticipations. Therefore faith can not save firom sin, or pain, or wretchedness, or moral
or spiritual death.  For the world to be saved fiomrn such direful
evils, the laws of society and the arbitrary governments of nations
must be changed, so as to coincide with the principles of Nature,
witll the constitution of man, and with all his physical and spiritual
requirements.
The blessings that would follow such an harmonious organization
of Mankind could not properly be considered as a reward or effect
of faith; because faith is merely an involuntary assent of the judgment, and produces that calmness and tranquillity of mind which
constitute happiness.  This happiness is confined to the mind whose
judgment is thus decided, and it is not capable of being communicated to another, nor can it even supply the physical or spiritual necessities of its possessor.  How, then, can salvation be a result of





## p. 527 (#555) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 527
faith?  And what can be more unjust than the severity and positiveness of that declaration which says, "He that believeth not
shall be damned"?  A  man can not believe or disbelieve at will.
IHIe can not control the convictions of his own judgment, but is
obliged to subnmit to be controlled.  He can no more have faith upon
any subject at will, than he can, by the exercise of will, have a warm
or cold feeling, or a love or hatred, or a delight or displeasure. How
unjust is it, then, to call upon man' to do that which is so entirely
beyond his power!  It would be as proper and consistent to cast a
man upon a burning pile, and bid him live, under tile penalty of being
for ever damned if he did not comply; or to cast a man into the
waters of a foaming ocean, and bid him preserve his existence, while
at the same time all means of salvation are beyond his reach; or to
place a man under the keen-edged guillotine, and, at the moment
appointed for the severing instrument to drop, to exclaim -" Resist
and prevent the blow, or you shall be for ever lost in the depths of
a burning abyss!"  Any being who would do these things would be
called by the world a tyrant, a heathen, a being not worthy of the
hunan form or of its sublime possessions.
Listen, then, ye who admire tile sentiment expressed in the book
of Mark, while I inquire, " IHow can the least degree of justice exist
in tile absoluteness of that demand which attaches the penalty of damnation to the non-performance of that which is beyond the powers of
man's nature to accomplish?"  If, then, this expression was ever uttered by Christ, it bears all the marks of cruelty and heathenish unrighteousness.  This is no less the case if it proceeded from the
mouthl of any other being.  But I am  happy to relate that although
this is in the book of'Mark, it was not uttered in the preaching of
Jesus.
~ 144. The next passage states a number of evidences to be manifested by those who truly believed.  It reads as follows: "And
these signs shall follow them  that believe: In my name shall they
cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take
up serpents without harm; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall
not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."  This is one of the most unfortunate passages that could
possibly occur for theologians and the followers of their philosophy
and teachings.  It can not be truly said that any possess the power
of casting out devils, in the sense in which the phrase is here used.





## p. 528 (#556) ############################################


52S            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
If the passage had said, " They shall cast in devils" (or evils), then
would it have been verified throughout the whole heathen and Christian world; for nothing is clearer than that the very believers and
promulgators of this system of theology have cast evils, or devils,
into the bosom of man, and into the heart of society, to an extent that
is beyond estimation.  Believers, then, cast devils IN, not OUT, by
preaching the doctrines supposed to have been taught by Christ. But
it can not be said with the same degree of truth that they ever succeeded in effectually banishing one devil, or evil, fiom the world.
Tile sentence which irnmmediately follows has been fully verified,
viz.: "' They shall speak with new tongues."  It has appeared in
the course of past investigations, that theologians (at least many of
them) do fiequently employ words in which neither they nor any
other person can discover the least particle of signification.  Therefore they truly speak in new tongues.  For the terms "satan,"' hell," " reward," " punishment," "involuntary," " supernatural,"
"disinterested," &c., are terms which express as near the shadow of
no substance as it is possible for the mind to conceive.  And I do
not hesitate to venture any strength of assertion that these terms, with
a vast number of others, are significant of no real thought, and are
incapable of being applied to any real principle, phenomenon, or development, in any department of Nature or the Universe. Any person, then, entertaining the least particle of doubt concerning the
truthfulness of the above sentence from Mark, should reflect on these
things, and banish all doubt immediately; for it is evident that these
theologians do speak in new tongues, inasmuch as they are scarcely
comprehended either by themselves or any other being.
I can not let this opportunity pass without observing some late
developments among the followers of new faiths.  These have occurred within the last century, and therefore no particular historical
detail is required.  So I proceed to mention the performances of the
sect known as the MORMONS.  The founder of this sect presented
to the world, not only his own testimony, but that of many others, in
relation to his and their religious faith and miraculous performances.
They professed to heal the sick by the " laying-on of hands," to cast
out devils, and to converse in unknown tongues.  They can produce evidence of an artificial character of these things, and of their
actual occurrence.  But there exists no interior evidence, probability,
or use, in any such performances, and therefore they should not receive the credence of any rational mind.  One thing, however,-in





## p. 529 (#557) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 5; 9
evidence of the possession of the right faith, they could produce in
abundance; and that is, they could converse in unknown tongues.
Strictly true is this statement, for some of the dissenters from that
faith do not hesitate to acknowledge that they could and did converse
in a language unknown either to themselves or to anybody else! The
followers of ANN LEE, also, whose history is well known, make the
same pretensions, and produce the same evidence; and their dissenters make, without hesitation, precisely the same acknowledgment.
Therefore beware of superficial testimony, external appearances,
visible, tangible, sensual evidences, because such are invariably liable
to deceive, and are oftentimes unrighteous.  Beware, too, of the
character of every external testimony.  Search well the cause of its
existence.  Reflect well upon the external means employed to produce credence in respect to any phenomenon-any marvellous circumstance-any miraculous development, either in Nature or in
mnan, and also upon the uses made of such; because there exists a
strong probability that there are latent intentions connected with such
evidences that constitute the very elements of deception.
~ 145. Many in past ages believed that the elephant was a prodigy
or miracle of Nature.  Some of the ancients supposed that he was
not only the result of a miraculous conception of Nature, but that he
possessed a spirit, and reasoning powers, equal if not superior to
those possessed by man.  Besides this, his social habits were believed by some to be established, directed, and controlled, by spirits
of the mountains, forests, and other places, which- they frequented.
The ancients had also an opinion that spirits communed with elephants, and instigated their thoughts; and that spirits, ghosts, witches,.
angels, devils, and many similar personages, existed in great abundance.  Is there not testimony in favor of the most marvellous
transactions of angels, devils, ghosts, witches, and other active, invisible beings?-testimonies, too, of the most unexceptionable character?
There are also now persons who believe that man is in constant
communion with spirits, either of a good or evil character; the first
being the cause of all good thoughts, and the latter of all evil ones.
They also believe that men possess the power to move toward thegulf of evil, or the throne of goodness.  This power is termed "'free.
iwill." They thus make man an independent and self-existent creature,
aud endeavor to impress ulpon his mind that if lie is sinful, it is tile,

result merely of his will, or his affection for evil; a quality whic  he
need not possess if he desires to be free from it.  Moreover, it is said
that le can approach the throne or sphere of celestial goodness by
the same exercise of his own will-power.  Such an attribute would
give man unlimited control over the laws, forces, and actuating principles, of the Universe.  It would make him possess the requisite
power to resist all temptation, and all influences of eternal laws.  It
would give him power to command, and teach him that he existed
uncormmanded.  It would give him  power to control, while he is
not at all capable of being controlled, influenced, or actuated!
But it may be said that he has " free will" only in a qualfJied sense.
But the very moment a qualification is needed, the doctrine is proved
to be unsound, and man's power is shown to be limited. If he can
not under all circumstances and conditions resist being influenced or
actuated, then the philosophy under notice is not true; because the
fact of man's being once influenced, establishes the truth that he is
actuated by adequate forces, and governed throughout eternity by
immutable laws.
Others believe that man may reproduce in himself the power of
working miracles, and say they have succeeded in presenting a demonstration.  Others at the present day believe that man possesses no
spiritual principle which will retain its identity after the physical dissolution.  These reason deductively, but not analytically; hence the
conclusion is illegitimate and unsound.  And there are existing innumerable sects, entertaining as many different opinions; and each
sect is anxious to sustain its own particular creed.
The followers of Ann Lee seriously believe and teach that select,persons among them commune with the spirits that inhabit celestial
spheres.  They frequently induce, by excitement, a cataleptic con-,dition of the body, and then are said to be in heaven, walking among
and conversing wvith the angels.  And when they return to outward
consciousness, they relate these marvellous peregrinations with all
-the seriousness and solemnity of truth-because they believe them.'Surely, then, miracles exist in our midst, of the same character as
those which are mentioned in the book of Mark as following all true'bel; avers.
1: it not as reasonable to esteem  heathen, ancient, Chinese, Persianic, or Mohammedan credulity, as the credulity of those who im-plicitly believe and teach the doctrines of the Primitive History? Is
it not just to regard the Mormon and Shaker evidences and credulit,





## p. 531 (#559) ############################################


NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                631
that exist in our midst, with the same degree of veneration as the
things merely related in the books of the New Testament, and believed by many in tile world? Certainly modern credulity is as much
to be respected as ancient.  Then why confine belief, when external
evidences of truefiaiths exist about and among us in abundance?
The sentence which follows the last one commented upon, refers
to the handling of serpents without harm.  Unfortunately, there exists much actual danger in this experiment; and hence it is not so,
frequently attempted as the former ones.  There exists evidence
that more men who have possessed scarcely any faith, have handled
serpents with perfect safety, than there have been persons who have
performed the same things among those possessing faith sufficiently
powerful almost to remove a light mountain.
Furthermore, it is said, " They shall drink any deadly thing withlout injury."  It is strange how deadly things can be drunk without
injuring i/fe. It is unnecessary to speak of the action of the human
system in repulsing or yielding to that which is opposed to its nature
or composition.  Poison can be taken into the system in minnute 2)ortions without injury; but if too great a portion is taken, it is incapable of assimilating with the elelnents of the body, and thus constitutes
a violation (though not a suspension) of natural law, the inevitable
result of which would be a cessation of life.  A true believer, then,
may take a small portion without receiving harm; but then this would
not be taking a deadly thing in the sense iinplied in the passage. Besides this, an unbeliever could, without injury, take the same quantity.
But it is plain that the handling of serpents and the drinking of poison
is an experiment that is rather too personal to be often attempted.
Alas for theologians, and those who think they are unerring believers! for the evidences which they can produce are so few and
so intangible, that the human mind is incapable of discerning their
existence.  Remember these external evidences are not to be in any
case relied upon as proving anything to which they are applied.  If
what I reveal requires external testimony to prove its truth, then indeed its truth might with propriety be doubted.  But if, while it possesses the external clothing of sensuous and superficial testimony, it
sinks deep into the recesses of the judgment, even to the interior of
the human spirit, and there receives a response, its truth is at once
placed beyond doubt, and is established to a demonstratiofi.  In this
manner should all things be tested; and then truth, goodness, and
tranquillity, will be the legitimate consequences.

532            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
With these remarks, I leave the contents of the book of Mark, to
speak of the writer personally. His name was JOHN MARK. He
was born and brought up, and resided through his life, in the city
of Jerusalem. He lived at the time John the Baptist and Jesus
were preaching.  He was a believer, and felt anxious to have the
new faith promulgated and believed; but he can not be properly
termed an apostle. He had a small family, and was pleasantly situated, both as to the capacity of his residence and his financial affairs.
He was accustomed to keep open his house as a place of entertainment and resort for Jesus and the apostles; and this continued during the whole public life of Jesus, and especially from about the
time he began to preach until his crucifixion. After this event, John
Mark compiled some of the remarks of Jesus, and some impressions
concerning him, from a few registered notes which he had kept, into
the form of a manuscript, which he designed and intended only for
the reading of some converts, mainly from paganism.
But it should be remembered that manuscripts written in those
days, upon bark or some similar substance, were never copied as
writings are copied in modern days.  So he alone possessed this record, and it was scarcely read or known to be existing by any other
persons than those for whom it was immediately designed, until a
long period after his death.  And what right Constantine and the
bishops assembled at Nice and Laodicea had to vote the book of
Mark as canonical, is not very easily explained; inasmuch as many
similar manuscripts and epistles were rejected and burned according
to the decision of their misdirected judgments.  Mark never intimated
that he desired or intended that the world at the nineteenth century
should read his registered historical impressions; nor was he ever
directed by Jesus to even write or publish them.  Whence, then,
this superstitious veneration for that which was never intended by
those whom you love most, even Jesus and the apostles, to be thus
superstitiously believed and sanctified by subsequent generations?
5 146. I now proceed to a brief consideration of the book of
LUKE, which follows:LUKE was a very candid, worthy, and well-instructed author. His
writings manifest a great deal of perspicuity, candor, and intended
truthfulness. He is serious in every respect, and worthy of the
deepest regard; and confidence should not be withholden from his
historical relations. He prefaced his remarks with a very clear and





## p. 533 (#561) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                633
lucid description of the character of his impressions concerning Jesus and the apostles, speaking particularly of the source of the information fiom  which he wrote.  He intimates that he penned that
which himself and many others " most' surely believed."   He
attaches no inspiration to his knowledge.  He courts the favor of no
person.  He does not claim to be believed because he writes; but
his whole introduction displays a beautiful simplicity and candor
which can not fail to commend the author to respect and esteem.
And what is still more remarkable is, that he discards that which is
claimed for him by commentators, and all who profess to believe that
he, in common with his associate writers, was supernaturally inspired.
How unrighteous, how injurious to the race it is, for men to claim
for the Bible that fear, that superstitious and unreal veneration, which
the Bible does not demand for itself!
Some may consider these sayings as derogatory to the holy purity
of the Bible, especially to that purity which interpreters attach to it
but which can not be found in that book. But instead of opposing
I am d(f'nding the writers of the New and Old Testament against
the superstitious falsifications that are imposed upon their writings by
those who profess to be their expounders.  I feel impressed to say
that the Bible, like all other books, should be respected for the intrinsic worth and trutlfulness which may characterize it; but for no
other reason.  Moreover, in speaking of superstitious and false interpretations, I refer to the fact that it is taught with a great deal of
sanctimloniousness, that its contents are an influx from the Divine
Mind into the minds of those who wrote it.  I am  distinctly impressed with the conviction that no book, or any other superficia
production of nian, can legitimately and truthfully claim such inspiration. For nothing can be of divine origin which is not inseparably
connected with, and incessantly developed by, the laws, qualities, and
priniiples, contained in the great Tree of universal causation.  A.nG
I have shown that that which man creates or invents merely by his
evanescent imagination, can not be anything more than a mass of
imperfection. Thus those books may contain truth, yet no book is
worthy the veneration which the Mohammedan pays to the KORAN,
the Brahmin to the SHASTER, the Persian to tilhe ZE.N-D AVESTA, or
the Christian to the BIBLE.
I have made these remarks with distinctness, so that there may be
no misapprehension, concerning that of which I am impressed to
speak, and that there may not exist any obscurity or discrepancy in

the minds of those who seriously reflect, who candidly investigate, and
who fear not to read, untrammelled by sectarian prejudice.
The book of Luke is very free from quotations from the prophecies. Those, however, that are made, are similar to those which I
have previously noticed.  This book advances no particular doctrine which in any way needs an explanation or comment. Nor do
I discover that its teachings are in any particular different from those
of the previous books, with the exception of some new parabolical
illustrations, some change in the expression, and also in the grouping of the historical accounts of the life, preaching, and crucifixion
of Jesus.  And those things which are in it advanced, have been, in
a general manner, commented upon in reviewing the several propositions, derived firom the book of Matthew.  So I will conclude all
reflections on this book, and offer a few remarks concerning its
author.
Luke also was of Jewish birth-was educated in the Jewish religion, and in this continued nearly to the time of Paul's conversion
from the Jewish to the Christian religion. Luke in his early lifelearned a trade, which was the custom among the Jewish people,
whether the parents of the young were or were not wealthy.  He
succeeded eminently in his profession, which was that of an artist,
He is said to have painted the first portrait of Christ, which is to be
seen at the present day in the Roman Academy of Design. After
Luke embraced the Christian religion, he was a constant co-worker
with many of the apostles and believers in various portions of the
eastern world.  He obtained his information principally from communications received from those who were eye-witnesses of the
things related concerning Jesus.  He wrote not from actual knowledge, but from that which he received fiom others. One of his particular friends was THEOPHILUS, whom he felt very anxious to convince of the truth of Christianity. To him he wrote this gospel and
the Acts of the Apostles; and these books were written for no other
purpose than to produce a conviction in the rmind of his friend, corresponding to that in his own. And it is well to inquire on what
authority were these writings voted canonical, when, at the same
time, many as worthy manuscripts were deprived of their existence.
Meanwhile, consider, reader, that Luke intended merely to convince
his f'icnd by writing and transmitting his thoughts in a connected
manner, and had no design that the whole world should be taught to
believe that of which he desired only to convince Theophilus. It may

be that he desired that such might be the case, because all who are
firmly convinced of any faith, desire to have it become universal.
But one thing is absolutely certain: le neither pretended to inspiration nor even anticipated being classed as lie has been, in a standard
cyclopedia of theology. Nor did he even once intimate that he entertained ally thought as to the distinction which his writings have
subsequentlly received.
Luke also wrote concerning the origin of the Ephesian church;
-how it was established; what teachings and ceremonies were adopted,
and how he and the brethren of the church exulted, and congratulated each other, in the possession of their new faith.  His books are
full of information, and they demand respect and approbation for
their simplicity and fluency of expression —at least as much respect
as the writings of any other good and worthy man.
~ 147. 1 next proceed to the book of JOHN.  This book displays
great warmth of feeling, affection, and social and religious attachment.
It manifests a great deal of veneration, and aspiring and noble sentiment; and these characterized the life, disposition, and spiritual
constitution of its author.  Its contents are mostly a repetition of
things recorded in the former books; and it contains but few appeals
to promiscuous expressions among the prophecies.  It establishes
no proposition that differs fiom those heretofore noticed, and hence
needs no further comment.
I can not, however, very well avoid one remark upon a casual and
unguarded sentence at the close of this book, in which John expresses the supposition, that if all the things which Christ performed were
written, "even the world itself could not contain the books that
would be written."  Notwithstanding there were thousands of things
said and done by Jesus which neither John nor any other writer re.
corded, it is plain to every mind that if those things were written, the
world would hold them.  This is an evidence of John's unbounded
and sanguine love for the faith which he had embraced.  And even
a little exaggeration on the part of the apostles, in writing their impressions, forbids at once the possibility of their minds being under
the controlling influence of inspiration from the Divine Mind. Whatever is divine -strictly of celestial birth - must bear unexceptionabli
evidence of its holy origin.
JOHN was born, and resided the greater portion of his life, in
Ephesus.  His early religious impressions were few; and when,

536             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
these tlhings were presented to his mind, he exercised a great deal
of judgment and reflection upon their merits, and afterward adopted
and promulgated them with a great deal of sanguine confidence and
energy.  His manuscripts, like Mark's, were a long time concealed
from public observation, but were subsequently translated into the
Hebrew language, were sanctioned by the council of Nice, sealed as
canonical by Constantine, and thus were presented to the world as
constituting the fourth book of the New Testament.
The fifth book, which follows, entitled "ACTS OF THE APOSTLES," is an historical commentary and registral production of LUKE.
It contains only a record of circumstances, experiences, travels, discussions, and vicissitudes, of the apostles; an account'of the formation and establishment of the church; and descriptions of the unity,
peace, quietness, and brotlherly love, which prevailed among the believers.  It does not contain any principles requiring comment or
elucidation.  And inasmuch as it is a book of historical information,
it claims for itself only this character.  If any other claims are set up
as to its origin, contents, or importance, then these claims are unwarrantable; and Luke, its writer, completely overthrows them.  It
certainly contains many beautiful and forcible expressions of sentiments, but no new principles; and hence I pass on to the consideration of the following books.' 148. I come now to reflect upon the birth, life, preachings, experience, disposition, and death, of a very highly-educated and muchbeloved writer.  Indeed, I can not resist the attraction toward so
worthy a mind-one possessing so much purity of soul and so much
lofty magnanimity.
Before I speak of his many friendly epistles to associated brethren
and established churches in various portions of the east, I will dwell
upon his birth, life, disposition, and experiences.
Ecclesiastical historians have collected some very truthful information concerning the birth and life of PAUL; and to their historical
accounts much credit should be given.  PAUL was born in Tarsus.
He dwelt during tile early portion of his life in the city of Rome,
and was there much esteemed as a highly-talented and respectable
citizen.  After receiving a very superior education through various
means of instruction, he subjected himself to a long and protracted
course of studies under the guidance and instruction of- Ganaliel in

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 637
Jerusalem.  Gamaliel was a professor of ancient literature, natural
philosophy, and traditional science, and was recognised as a superior
teacher of the various languages. He was a Jewish rabbin. From
him Paul received many doctrines and religious hypotheses, which
afterward in a measure gave direction to llis religious meditations and
writings.  After Paul had completed his education, he was truly an
enlightened nman, so far as a knowledge of external science and philosophy is worthy to be termed enlightenment.
He was also familiar with the Grecian poets and philosophers,
and from them received much of his sublime thought and rational
philosophy. Indeed, this is plain from a part of his writings contained in the New Testament; for many of his expressions as connected with his moral philosophy, evince a striking similarity of
views and style to those of the Grecian poets and metaphysicians.
PAUL cultivated many useful social accomplishments. His social
life was of an exceedingly complex.character, for it was extensively
interwoven with various experiences both of a pleasing and disappointing nature.  These were of such a character *as tended constantly to modify and develop in him new traits of mental constitution.  He, like Luke, learned a very useful trade, namely, that of
tent-making, which he subsequently discovered to be of great advantage and importance to him.  Being a Roman citizen for a great
portion of his life, his character, religion, philosophy, and deportmnent, were very much like those with whom he familiarly associated;
and therefore he can not be said to have possessed a predisposition
to become what he subsequently did become. Nor can it be said
that he required a spiritual influx of superior truths to write his moral
philosophy; for he was superiorly enlightened in all important branches of knowledge, such as the arts, science, logic, metaphysics, and
physical and religious philosophy.  But this much can be said-and
the assertion is fully attested by his own productions-that he was a
most pure, worthy, benevolent, and devotional man, characterized by
all those superior qualifications that are required to constitute a truly
great and good mind.
During the time that Jesus lived, and while his doctrines were
being disseminated, Paul was a most violent opposer, and unqualifiedly rejected and despised the doctrines that lie afterward so rapurously embraced.  This opposition continued for many years after
the death of Christ, during which period lie embraced the Pharisaical philosophy, which contained some truth, though that truth was

entirely concealed by a superabundance of error arising merely from
external, material observation.  And after Paul joined this sect, he
assumed the position of commander, at tile head of a band or army
composed( of the same sect, and marched against and persecuted the
Christian believers to an unjust and unwarrantable extent.  Thus
was he employed for a long period.  He manifested in all cases the
most violent and sanguinary intentions against the Christians.  All
his movements were characterized by a great degree of firmness, and
an eager and positive determination to have his own opinions and
principles prevail.
It is related that while on his way to Damascus, he experienced a
sudden change in his actuating motives and intentions; and this occurrence has been related in such a manner as to convey the impression that it proceeded from a miraculous or supernatural interposition
of the Divine Mind. I am fully aware of the circumstance, and also
wily such an ocular impression was received; and an acquaintance
with the fact as it occurred dissipates immediately all superstitious
ideas of a miraculous interposition.
From this period, the faculties of Paul took a different direction,
and he became devoted to the Christian religion; the consequence
of which was a violent denouncement of the doctrines and persecutions of his past life.  Thus were displayed the extremes in the
workings of a nervous-sanguine temperament: for he then rejected
the Pharisaical and exerted his powers to sustain the Christian religion, with the same degree of ardor and positiveness that lie had
before manifested in defence of the Pharisaical religion against the
Clhristian.
He now devoted his life and talents to the promulgation of the
gospel.  In this lie was employed for thirty years, during which time
he travelled and preached in Arabia, Greece, Asia Minor, and on
many islands of the Mediterranean.  He was active in establishing
societies and religious associations, in order to bring more closely
together those who believed the new faith, so that they might congregate and worship in accordance with the doctrines which they had
embraced.  In this work lie manifested much zeal, devotion, and
activity.  He likewise adopted the custom  of epistolary correspondence, which had previously been introduced by other converts and
apostles. His epistles were generally directed to the prominent members of the churches, and were also addressed indirectly to the whole
congregation in each vicinity where he had labored to deposite a

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 539
germ of Christianity.  Hence, some of those epistles were preserved,
collected, compiled, and immersed into the New Testament, in the
following order:
1. Paul's Epistle to the Romans.-This was addressed to the
Roman church or congregation that had' associated to enjoy the faith
which both he and they had embraced.  2. Paul's Epistles to the
Corinthians, or to the congregration of associated brethren in the faith
at Corinth.  3. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians; being a letter of
exhortation, expressive of firiendship and brotherly kindness, to the
worshipping brethren in the church of Galatia.  4. Paul's Epistle to
the Eph/esians; being a kind and firiendly letter to those who had embraced the faith, and who desired the encouragement and approbation of Paul, at Epllesus.  5. Paul's Epistle to the Philippians;
being a kind letter of encouragement and congratulation to the church
of Philippi on the possession0of their new faith.  6. Paul's Epistle
to the Colossians; which is a letter expressing spiritual sympathy and
congeniality of affection for the brethren in Colosse, together with
earnest desires for the success of the gospel among them.  7. Two
of thle many epistles written by Paul to the Thessalonians; consisting
of prayerful and devout exhortations, and expressions of approbation,.
sympathy, affection, and love, to the whole congregation of worshippers at Thessalonica.  S. Paul's epistles to his much-admired friend'rlMOTHY, who was a private correspondent and a general co-worker
with Paul.  This Timothy sustained an office in the church modernly called deacon, and in this capacity presented Paul's much-admired
advice to the congregation of which he was a member.  9. Paul's
epistle to TITUS, who was in a similar office, and who was equally
beloved as a brother and correspondent, by Paul. 10. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews; in which he expresses all his devotional sympathy
for the doctrines cherished in his memory, and also manifests all that
loving-kindness and perseverance which characterized all his efforts
in the propagation and establishment of the Christian faith.
5 149. Thus Paul's letters occupy and compose a large portion
of the New Testament.  On investigation of these letters, it appears
lplain that they never were intended or expected by Paul to be universally read.  Not only is the internal evidence sufficient to warrant
this conclusion, but the historical evidence is such as entirely to demnonstrate its truth. What I mean by the internal evidence or sigy

nification of written thoughts, is that connected with the source or
origin firom which they sprang —the basis upon which the thought
or the element of the expression reposes.
Some suppose that an interior meaning is discoverable in every
expression in the Bible; but that this can be perceived only by those
who have a high degree of spiritual discernment-while others,
whose knowledge is confined to the sphere of sensuous observation
and impression, are constantly interpreting the contents of the Bible
in a gross and literal manner.  Giving to any book or its contents a
i"spiritual signification," is not to unfold an interior origin or cause
of the ideas expressed; but it is merely setting aside its literal signification, and clothing its teachings with a spiritual garment.  This is
manifestly covering or concealing expressions, which are sometimes
loose, unguarded, and even unighteous and insignificant, with a brilliant external and ornamental garment.  But it is distinctly clear that
in order to search into the interior or germ of a thought, the mind
must become acquainted with the causes engaged in developing that
germ into the form of a written expression. And it is absolutely
impossible to give a real signification to expressions the soul or cause
of which originated merely in the theology and mythology of an age
when misdirection and unreasonable hallucination had possession, to
a great extent, of the mind of every human being.
Language may and has changed. When the inhabitants of early
ages used the terms Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Juno,
Pallas, &c., their thoughts became directly associated with various
gods that were supposed to be existing in the invisible world, the
history of whom  they had preserved in hieroglyphics.  But now
when these terms are used, the mind does not revert to these heathen
deities, but becomes directly associated with the various planets and
asteroids of our solar system.  Thus it is that language has, in its
application, become exceedingly changed.  Therefore, what Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Christ, Paul, or any of the writers of the
Bible, have written, may have signified at that time what at the present day can not be understood by the same terms.  Inasmuch, then
as the application of many terms has ceased to be as it was in former
ages, whatever signification may now, by conventional usage, be given
to terms employed by oriental writers, can not possibly change the
positive fact that their writings were conceived and brought forth
amid various causes which it is necessary to analyze and comprehend,
before there can be such a thing as understanding what the germ,

NAT:URLE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               541
soul, or element of any expression, would indicate as its real and
original signification,
I am particularly desirous of being apprehended aright in speaking
of this important distinction between the interior signfication of a
term  or expression, and that spiritual application which has been
called an interior meaning.  In order to be distinctly understood, I
again repeat that no mind can search into and analyze the interior
meaning or origin of words or expressions, without arriving irresistibly at the conclusion which has been heretofore attained- that the contents of the Bible, like those of all other books, have originated among
a number of productive causes, all of which must be taken into consideration before any validity or importance can be attached to the
records therein contained. No analytical mind can by any possible
means arrive at conclusions contrary to those which are here established. And be it further understood that I stay not on terms, or on
the thousands of sermons and commentaries that have grown out of
a supposed hidden signification of expressions in the Bible.  For to
dwell upon these would be only to analyze the shadows, the intangible unrealities, which consist of the innumerable interpretations of
the Bible —which latter is assumed to be what it does not itself profess to be, and what it in reality is not, and never was. Know, then,
reader, that I am analyzing, dissecting, and investigating the germ of
all these superfluous productions.  And this is the result of the strict
and severe analysis: that the elements and qualities contained in the
Bible, or the germ of this great theological tree, are positively impure,
and unworthy of the interpretations and veneration which they have
received in the form of the book to which they have given origin.
And this book can not by any possible means be proved to contain
those pure and celestial qualities that dwell in Divine Love and Wisdom, which constitute the GERM, the development of which is a grand,
sublime, and harmonious Universe, of which Mlan is a branch and a
perfect representative. As this latter, therefore, constitutes the true
theology, certainly a theology can not be unlike it and at the same
time true.
These considerations (the truth of which certainly can not be disproved without some investigation) show that it is impossible to give an
interior signification of a spiritual character to that which does not
already contain a Divine and celestial element. Hence the doctrine
which I discover in the world as resulting from a spiritual commentation upon the Bible, is not a revealment or development of the in

542            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
terior possessions of that book, but only a new and attractive garment
in which the vwhole confused collection of matter is concealed from
the mind, both of the casual and the reflective reader.  This much,
however, may be said for the consolation of him who reads understandingly, and with the yearnings of a philanthropic bosom: that
Reason and Wisdom, like the sun, will shine and bring forth all desirable and congenial results, when the clouds of obstruction and misconception are dissipated for ever!
~ 150. In the ten books or epistles of PAUL, I discover no distinct doctrine that I have not in a general way noticed and commented
upon in previous remarks. WMy object at present is to make it clear
to the mind of tile reader that Paul was a good man.-worthy of
great esteem  and confidence, and that he embraced his faith, and
wrote concerning it, as any other man would have done, who felt
convinced that the faith which he had adopted ought to be extensivery believed.
PAUL is the only writer in the whole Bible who attempts to prove
his faith by an appeal to Nature.  His philosophy was evidently impressed upon his mind prior to his embracing Christianity; and lie
appealed to external and visible manifestations to illustrate or demonstrate his peculiar doctrines.  These he presented to the brethren
with whom he familiarly and frequently corresponded. But he never
wrote a system of moral philosophy to be taught and believed by
subsequent generations of the earth; and that he did, there exists no
evidence in his epistolary correspondence.
The doctrine of the resurrection —of a literal rising of the natural
body —is supposed by some to be positively taught and clearly demnonstrated by Paul. This, however, is not true, though the form cr
expression evinces a belief in such a doctrine.  Thus he says,
"We are sown in a natural body, and raised in a spiritual body; we
are sown in dishonor, and raised in glory."  (1 Cor. xv.)  It is
clear, from these expressions, that Paul uses the terms natural and
spiritual, dishonor and glory, in contradistinction to each other; so
that the superior would be rendered more beautiful by being placed
in contrast with the inferior.  Thus his thoughts were elevated by a
high degree of hope and anticipation.  But it will be admitted by
those who carefully reflect upon the preceding Remarks, that these
illustrations and appeals to natural phenomena by Paul, are of a very
superficial character; for although we are, in one sense, sown in a





## p. 543 (#571) ############################################


NATURE:S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 543
natural and raised in a spiritual body, these terms are more an expression of the act than of the p2rinciple of a resurrection.  So, also,
Deing  sown in dishonor and raised in glory, represents the external
phenomenon of death, and the elevation of the real, or internal man,
to a higher sphere.  It was but the flict that he related, not the interior moving and productive principles which effect the rising, refinement, ainastasis, or resurrection.  Therefore, I say, Paul's external
philosophy of the resurrection possesses none of that elaborateness,
or of those appeals to the laws governing Nature and man, which
would be necessary to satisfy any rational mind of the reality of a
future or interior existence.
Again: Paul was given to great internal meditation, especially so
far as his peculiar temperament and disposition would admit.  At
times his cogitations were of a very instructive and useful character.
But he sometimes became confused in endeavoring to make a distinction between the intrusions of the outer world upon the senses,
affections, and passions, and the promptings and monitions of the
internal sense of purity, justice, refinement, and righteousness.
Hence he says, " While I would do good, evil is present'with me."
When forced to this exclamation, he was endeavoring to distinguish
the characters and causes of the two suggestive influences, the one to
evil and the other to good.  Theological speculators have derived
from this and similar expressions of Paul, a smoothly-woven theory,
that a pervading evil spirit, or'his agents, are incessantly affecting
mana' internal purity through the outer; and that the good is preserved by the Divine Mind; and proceeding upon this hypotltesis,
they say that man should distinguish the good from the evil —the
broad road which leads to a burning abyss of everlasting destruction,
from the narrow path leading as far from that dreadful abode as one
extremity of the Universe can be from another.  Thus they throw
tilhe responsibility upon, and accuse man, of immorality, and at the
samne time teach him that ten thousand influences are actuating and
even controlling him, either for good or for evil. It is plain that such
not only misunderstand the writings and teachings of Paul, but are
exceedingly uninformed as to the nature, constitution, and characteristics of mankind.
PAUL, after having preached  for thirty years, and consoling
hiimself on the reflection that he had declared the whole gospel without reservation, was captured, brought before a Roman consul,
and at length before Festus; who, being moved by Paul's elo

quence, absolved him from the charge brought against him. Paul,
however, having appealed to Caesar, was sent to Rome, where he
finally died, a martyr to Christianity.
Following the epistles of Paul, are the similar letters of JAMES,
PETER, JOHN, and JUDE. The contents of these are very similar to
the letters of Paul, pertaining, as they do, to the establishing of the
same general principles in the minds of the persons and congregations to whom they were respectively addressed.  They introduce
no new principle which requires comment; and their teachings have
no important bearing upon the proposition advanced in or derived
fiom the preceding books.
~ 151. After these epistles, follows the APOCALYP1E or REVELATION OF ST. JOHN. The contents of this book have appeared
to all commentators as being completely enigmatical, beyond the possibility of receiving a useful application, and so exceedingly indefinite and obscure as almost to defy any attempt at analysis.  It bears
truly every mark of a revelation; nor can this fact be doubted when
it is carefully read and as carefully reflected upon.  Its prominent
features are obscurity, ambiguity, and all kinds of fantastic and figurative expression.  Nevertheless, some of its figures are well applied,
though their application is scarcely discoverable.  Indeed, nothing
can be more obscure than this revelation; for its contents defy interpretation, though they at the same time severely demand the most
unreserved faith.  The book even forbids the erasure or interpolation of a single sentence, under the most imperative command, for a
disobedience of which condemnation is denounced.  Such a demand
of itself removes from it all that celestial purity which should be expected to characterize a spiritual influx of heavenly truth; for the
demand is strictly dogmatical, and unjustly imperative.  This book
ends the New Testament.
It should be remarked that the books of James and Jude have
been received with a great deal of doubt as to their authenticity, by
those who have ventured to inquire into the origin of the manuscripts.
Moreover, let it be remembered that they, together with the Revelation of St. John, were not received into the New Testament as oure
and canonical until nearly three hundred years after the council of
Nice. The Apocalypse, and the books of James and Jude, together





## p. 545 (#573) ############################################


NAT'URE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  545
with the second chapter of the second epistle of Peter, were voted
pure and canonical in the year 633, at the council of Toledo; when
they, in their seventeenth canon, decided unanimously that the Revelation was written by John, and that the books of James and John
should be compiled and immersed into the New Testament, and
stamped with the holy seal, and considered the >Ford cf God!
It would indeed have been fortunate for many a profound theologian, had this council, like the councils of Nice and Laodicea, rejected
this book as not being the word of God; for then much time and
noble talent would very probably have been expended on something
that would have been of use and importance in the way of ameliorating the condition of a suffering and ignorant humanity.  Inasmuch,
however, as the Apocalypse was decided to be the word of God in
633, it is proper to institute a few considerations concerning its teachings, and enigmatical, fantastical, and spiritual contents.
It is a truth worthy of notice, that many things therein contained
are susceptible of being verified by appealing to the actual appearances and manifestations of the interior* or spiritual world.  Panora.mas and dissolving representations such' as this book presents. mayr
be observed in the spirit-world by spirits whose internal perception
is not opened, and when their exteriors are clothed by an aerial mantle of imagination.  Such are witnessed in what may be termed a,
transition state between the external and internal spheres of tile spiritual constitution.

subject, and entitled "Apocalypsis Exptlitcata"-which will clearly
elucidate his views of the use and application of this book.  I would'
again, however, guard the reader against the danger of misconception while reading the works referred to.  For it is distinctly clear
that their author was in the same general condition, both physically
and mentally, with the writer of the Apocalypse.  It will be seen that.

between the rudimnental and the spiritual spheres.  By this I would
be understood that both writers had a perception of that which was
between the real and the unreal.  I may remark, however, that the
author of the "Apocalypsis Revelata" was at times in a condition of
spiritual elevation which enabled him to arrive accurately at the most
important truths as pertaining to the spiritual states, or the spheres
of the inner world.  But it is proper to state distinctly that the conclusions at which he at such times arrives, though true, are not the
legililnate results of his philosophy.  It appears that his mind received
its direction froom an impression originally received concerning an interior signification of the Word, or Bible.  The result of this was to
lead hlis Inind into a correspondential mode of philosophizing concerning the thoughts, desires, passions, affections, and the states of
the judgments of men, considering these as being represented by various species of animals, vegetables, and even minerals.  According
to his philosophy, the animal kingdom was merely a transcript or universal representation of the various thoughts, desires, passions, and
judgments of mankind.  He applies this mode of philosophizing in
interpreting the contents of the Old and New Testaments, and represents the figures therein contained as holding an inseparable coninexion with, and as corresponding to, the various truths in the exteTior as well as to those in the interior world.  He teaches that in the
spiritual world, in like manner, exist representatives, both such as are:and such as are not within the power of infernal spirits to render apparently real and substantial to tho uninitiated and uninformed spirits.
Thus his mind flowed friom  the Bible into the natural world, not
for the purpose of testing its truth by instituting a disinterested inquiry
into the teachlings of Nature, but more for the purpose of interpreting
physical or external manifestations in such a way as to make the
Bible and Nature mutually confirm each other. Then, in like maniner, his mind flowed from the Word or Bible into the spiritual or
interior world, where the same direction of mind produced a desire,to make each manifestation accord with his prepossessions in favor'of the Bible as being the great Centre and Fount of Truth.  Thus
lie made the Word, or Bible, the focus or centre of Divine truth, to
wlhich the teachings of Nature should be considered as subordinate;
and he supposed that her productions were nothing more than par-,ticular correspondences, or rather were verifications of the truth of,the Bible —and likewise representatives of the thoughts and spirituial characteristics of man.  So, according to him, the material world

is only a reflection, a microcosm, a representation of the Bible, of its
truths, and of the interior or spiritual world.  And while the natural
world slhould be considered as below, inferior, and subordinate to the
Bible, the spirit-world should be considered as no more than a response to this biblical philosophy.  Thus hejoins the natural and
spiritual world, by making " the Word" the fulcrum, the mediator,,he centre and source, from which proceeds all the natural and spiritual knowledge worthy of being attained, and to which the two
worlds converge: so that around the Bible the whole natural and
spiritual world may be said to revolve.
I shall have occasion hereafter to recur to the main spiritual teachings
of this autlhor, which in their prominent features are substantially true,
thoug-h they need the same kind of interpretation to make them correspond with the mighty movements of the universal principle of the Divine Mind, which lie has given to the Bible, Nature, and the spirit-world.
~ 152. I have already related the manner in which those three
books in the New Testament were decided as canonical, and as be-.ing the word of God.  In connexion with what I have said on this
subject I would ask, " Why were they not as much the word of God
as other manuscripts of a similar character-and why were they not
received as canonical in the year 325, when assembled the council
of two thousand ferocious and exasperated bishops?"  Let it also be
remembered in connexion with this important inquiry, that the bishops
were so much interested in having their peculiar tlheological opinions
prevail, as to come near having a general quarrel; and over fifteen
hundred of them were as a consequence disqualified from hlaving a
vote!  Only a few more than three hundred, together with Constantine, at last remained!
I would now propose another question, to which I am not anxious
to receive a personal answer, but I desire that the answer should be
fully and truthfully presented to the world: " Why were not tlhose
fifteen hundred bishops who were discarded, as well qualified to decide which books were the word of God, as those who remained?
For those who did vote were under the imperative command of Constantine-at least not to transgress the rules of the council.  Did
justice prevail when foul fanaticism, folly, and unrighteousness, took
possession of the minds of those bishops?"
Also remember, reader, that when you read the encyclopaedia ol
religious knowledge called the Bible, you are merely reading a book

pronounced the word of God by three hundred exasperated bishops
and sealed by their emperor Constantine! Moreover, reflect that
nearly as many manuscripts as are now embodied in the Old Testament. suffered martyrdom!  And why, or how, or by whose imperative conmmnand, shall we believe that those which are saved are the
word of God, any more than those which were destroyed?
I will close these comments upon the books of the Bible by presenting a few considerations that should govern every mind in its
love for the many truths, and its dislike for the many falsities, that
exist in the world.  When I was first impressed to reveal my convictions concerning the Primitive History, I was led to consider this
one important query: " What is the use that such a book may subserve in accomplishing the end for which mankind were created?
Suppose that every sentence, for instance, in the Apocalypse, is true,
and can be verified in the third sphere of spiritual existence, what
possible use or benefit can be derived from truths that are only truths
in spheres beyond the comprehension of any human being on earth?'
I am distinctly impressed that the sayings of the Apocalypse, and
also that the sayings of many men at the present day, may be verified, and can be proved true.  That, however, is not conclusive
evidence that even those who uttered these sayings were themselves
conscious of their truth, or of their susceptibility of being verified in
higher degrees of development. Then all minds should be influenced
by the inquiry, "V What possible good can a revelation of any kind do
for mankind in their rudimental sphere, when the principles presented
in such revelation are beyond the possibility of human practice? The
truth or falsity of the contents of the Apocalypse can not in the least
particular accelerate the movements of mankind toward the goal of
social happiness, or the elevation of the spiritual constitutions of men
to a high degree of refinement and knowledge.  Anything that has
not a use of a practical nature, is not worth the room it occupies in
the world; for all such things are productions of the misconceptions
of men, and are thus unreal as well as impracticable.  Therefore the
importance of a truth should be determined by the inquiry as to its
iuse, and by its capability of a beneficial application.
~ 153. In conclusion to my previous remarks on the contents and
teachings of the Primitive History, I discover a use in inserting
some important synthetical remarks, commending the same to universal thouuht and consideration.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 549
1. As to the origin of the conceptions of Adam  and Eve, the
Garden of Eden, the Fall of Man, and Original Sin.  The first inti-;nation of these conceptions, I find in my impressions concerning the
early inhabitants of the earth.  They were not believed or imbibed
to a great extent until several generations after the tradition was fully
established.  It continued to be a tradition for several ages, without
any particular modification, until finally it became a part of the religion of the IHindoos, and especially of the Persians, who wrote the
same, and preserved it in manuscript.  It was scarcely taught or believed among the Jews until.those Persian manuscripts were translated into Hebrew, during their captivity at Babylon.  After this it
was considered as an allcgory, and much venerated by the Jews and
others, as being a symbolical representation of something substantially true: but what its meaning was, they knew not.  Still, the antiquity of the tradition sacredized it in their minds; and hence it is
presented in the book of Genesis.  Since its introduction into this
book, it has been interpreted, and clothed with all the seriousness
and veneration which should properly be connected with the beauties of Nature, with man, and with heaven.  Since that period, successive modifications of this supposed divine relation have so far
concealed its original simplicity fiom mankind generally, that they
are incapable, through fear, dread, and prejudice, of instituting a
proper investigation respecting its real merits.  Thus it is entirely
within the power of those who present it to the world for credence,
and is entirely removed from the mass of mankind.
2. The conception of an evil spirit or devil, may also be traced to
the interior history of mankind.  At first it was called " breath," and
was attributed to the heat and light of the sun.  This continued to
be believed in various forms by each subsequent generation, untilit
was systematized as I have related, when it received the name of
Siva. This was promoted by the magi of Persia to the office of a
deified principle of evil, and was elevated by Zoroaster to a position
as high, as great, and as mighty, as the Creator, at which time it was
named Ah/riman. It was not believed by the early Christian writers
to be anything more than an influx of evil, or of a'spirit of wickedness, which was similar to the belief of mankind in the early ages.
And when the early Christians used the term Satan, they used it unguardedly, and not as signifying any definite and established principle of being.  The same thing was also named Shaitan, which is
rendered "satan," " devil," "darkness," " evil," and by similar





## p. 550 (#578) ############################################


550            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
indefinite terms, meaning in no case an evil being or fallen angel, but
representing that only which interfered with tlheir peace and tranquil
lity of mind.
3. The conception of a hell originated among the inhabitants of
central America, and became established by a very ingenious and en-'ightened chieftain. The tradition of this ultimately run into the Jewish nation, and was strongly entertained by various sects arnong them,
though by others as strenuously discarded, until the meaning of the
original term was changed from  that of a local, burning abyss, to a
condition of darkness, the grave, sepulchre, death, and similar things,
which are expressed by the Hebrew word shcol, and by the Greek
words hiades and gehennta. These terms bore a synonymous signification, but all of'them were employed in the sacred writings of the
Jews in a metaphorical manner, as signifying no more than the terms
previously mentioned.  In no case are those words in the Bible significant of a fount of evil, sin, or burning, such as has been supposed
to be meant by the word " hell."  This word itself, in its strictest
sense, signifies concealment, invisible, darkness, under ground, abyss,
sepulchre, and all things that are opposed to the light of investigation.
4. l'he doctrine of a General Resutrrection (ti/d.tudginmct, was
believed among various sects of the Jews and Persians, over fifteen
hundred years before Christ lived, and was firmly established, all
over the eastern world by Zoroaster, the Persian Bible-maker, six
hundred years before Christ began to preach.  In the New Testanient, these doctrines of Zoroaster are used in a symbolical manner,
by Christ and others, to represent states of mind, and various other
things, in order that his hearers, and the eastern world generally,
mnight understand the teachings presented.  A  general resurrection
and judgment is not taught in onle palrge of the Bible; and even if it
were, that fact would not be proof of its truth, so long as Natuize continues to exist and to unfold and manifest her immutable laws.
5. The conception of Prolphecy existed among the Egyptians and
eastern tribes, many centuries before either the Old or New Testament had an existence; and then the word iroplccy did not necessarily, as it does'not even in the Bible, imply the announcement of
a future occurrence, or the revealment of anything foreseen by those
impressed to speak or write, and which afterward was fulfilled.  In
this sense the word " prophecy" does not occur in the Bible.  It
was then used in the sense of terms modernly employed, such as, to
"speak," "relate," or to express one's opinion; and the phrase





## p. 551 (#579) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                551
" prophesy unto us," simply meant, "let us hear your reasons""what is your mind?"-"  express your thoughlts freely," &c.
Hence 1 Samnuel, x. 5, speaks of a company of prophets who " prophesied" on various musical instruments; " prophesying" meaning, in
this instance, as in all others, nothing more than a delivery or announcement of any thought, sound, action, or a relation of any traditional occurrence.  In modern days, commentators have supposed
that the term prophecy was employed to express knowledge (derived
from inspiration) of some great occurrence to transpire in future.
Hence they have changed the term from its original meaning to a
signification which it never was intended to bear.  When the writers
of the New Testament quote from the writings of the Old, they
merely appeal to expressions which seem applicable to the occurrence which they are recording, in the same way as an author at the
present day would quote a sentence firom Homler, Cicero, Xenoplhon, Confucius, Pope, or any poetical or theological writer, using
language which seemed to correspond to or verify the thoughts
which he might be expressing. Therefore I positively affirmn, without
going into the details of evidence, that the term prophecy, in its original meaning, applies only to the mere act of expressing or announcing thoughts; and in no case was it used to represent a
preknowledge of a future occurrence.
6. The term  Atonement is entirely a manufactured expression,
having no connexion with the pure and reforming principles of Jesus,
or of any other good and philanthrophic being.  It is impossible for
any mind to conceive of any propriety in its present application.
7. The words "Faith" and "Regeneratio&n" are words suggested
by tenets previously and unwarrantably assumed.  Hence they apply only to a system  of man's invention, but not to the grand constitution of a Divine creation, of which man is a flower and a perfected organization.
~ 154. Thus I discover that the opinions in the world concerning
Adam  and Eve, the garden of Eden, the fall of man, the devil, hell,
and many such subjects referred to in the Bible, are more or less
mythological and parabolical, and were traditional among the eastern
inhabitants until they became introduced, in a very modified form,
into the writings of the Primitive History, where they are now supposed by many good, but misdirected and uneducated minds, to be
the revealed thoughlts of that Great Divine Essence, whose very life





## p. 552 (#580) ############################################


652             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
animates man and Nature, and makes of all things one grand, sublime, and harmonious System!  So also I discover that the opinions
concerning a general resurrection and judgment are lilkewise rnythological in the strictest possible sense-containing not the least particle of useful or substantial truth, and hence they can hlave no tendency to elevate and purify the race.
The original conception of the Trinity arose firom the three supposed beings called Parama, Vishnu, and Siva, which are no more
nor less than what are named by some theologians " Father," " Son,"
and " Spirit."  This trinity was not established in the world until
the Egyptian priests of the Sun, and the Persian maoi, promoted the
three beings to a higher degree of potency than they originally possessed; and the conception was grasped by Zoroaster, who immediately converted them into three united beings, equal and infinite in
power, and the same in essence and constitution.  Subsequently,
these were introduced into the sacred writings of the Jews, or the
Bible, more as symbolic representatives than as real doctrines to be
taught and believed.  But the Athanasian creed erected of them three
infinite Gods, equal to those of Zoroaster.  In this they are termed' Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;" and it is said that tile Father is
infinite-the Son is infinite-thie Holy Ghost is infinite: yet these
are not three, but ONE.  But in the first place, persons who are acquainted with arithmetical calculation will perceive that this is a vioIation of all numerical rules: for three can in no case be made to
count one, nor can one ever be made to equal thlree.  Tlherefore the
creed in this particular must transcend all ordinary minds!
It may be furtlier remarked that three Infinites can not possibly
exist, because ONE INFINITE comprehends the Whole.  And if
one being is greater than another, then the creed must be falsehoowever such a conclusion may interfere with the tranquillity of those
who at plesent repose confidence in its truth.
The doctrine of the trinity was thus derived from the early conception of three original beings that were supposed to have been
engaged in creating the earth and man —the earth being supposed in
those days to be the centre of the whole Universe.  And as I clearly
perceive the origin of this doctrine, I hesitate not to declare that it is'strictly a mythos; and it is rendered no more sacred or wortly of
veneration because the original fantastic conception has in modern
days been so beautifully sublimated.
Furthermore, I am happy to be in a condition to know that what,

ever things in tile Bible are not historical, are, with few exceptions,
entirely allegorical and mytliological, and are not worth the time that
bas been employed in their investigation by so vast a number of good
and rilghteous theologians who might have been  much  better employed, and thus have merited and received the thanks and approbation of an improved and benefited race.
I descend not into details to collect external proofs of the seemingly
mere assertions that have been made; for this would not comport
with the use and object of these revealments concerning the laws and
requirements of Nature.  But be it distinctly understo'od that I am
impressed to maintain the responsibility of the statements herein presented; and at a future period I shall descend into the minutiae of
the various subjects generalized in this book, for the sole purpose of
giving forth an incontestable encyclopaedia in which every unreal
and erroneous conception may be exhibited in its proper lirght, and in
which may be established every important truth  that is not at the
present (day known or comprehended by the generality of mankind.*
Several times during the period in which this book was in process of dictation,
the author incidentally remarked in substance, that inasmuch as this work was merely
intended to establish general principles, it would be inappropriate to enter into minutim; for that would not only be to swell this volume to an unreasonable size, but
to divert the mind of readers fromn great, leading, and essential points, by a multiplicity
of particulars which, whether true or untrue, can be of little consequence, until the
great general Truths are properly established, which constitute the Foundation of all
particulars, and the Basis of' all true reasoning. It will be observed that in the foregoing pages, the author promises a revealment or discussion of the particulars of several things, which, after all, are not subsequently mentioned in this book. His prophetic impressions taught him that he was to be the instrument of revealing to the
world the things referred to; but according to explanations which he has given in
foregoing pages, such impressions take no cognizance of times or circumstances. He
did not, therefore, know what specific points in his proposed revelation were to be
embodied in this book, and what were to be reserved for another, until this book was
completed. Hie does not even profess to know how soon the next book will be given:
but says he knows that he will be impressed to commence it at the proper time, and
that it will be before the world as soon as it is needed. He has promised us in the
next book a more thorough and minute discussion of all the important subjects introduced in this, particularly of the subjects of cosmogony, geology, archeology, ethnology, language, mythology, hagiography, theology, and the spiritual spheres.  The
structure of the Universe, for instance, will be more particularly unfolded to the
mental view, and calculations in regard to distances, magnitudes, numbers, periods,
&c., will be introduced. Also the laws of nebulous agglomeration and planetary
motion will be more thoroughly explained; the inhabitants of the planets of our
Solar System, with their institutions and customs, will be more minutely described;
and other subjects will in like manner be enlarged upon. Also the details of the
new Social System proposed in the third part of this book (and which is the grand
obh;ect of the whole work), will then be given, and all further necessary rules will

~ 155. In concluding my remarks upon the Bible, I will speak
historically concerning its origin. and formation.  Let it first be observed that a great deal of veneration is attached to the word BIBLE
-more, indeed, than should be attached to a large portion of its
contents.  The word bible signifies merely a book.  It is derived
firom the Greek biblos, which signifies the soft bark of a tree upon
which the ancients wrote their thoughts.  To this was subsequently
prefixed the word "haoly," wlhich term was employed by the Jews
to express excellence.  Thus the terms "Holy Bible" might be
rendered " eecellent soft bark;" and then the world would understand
their original signification.
The books that compose the Old Testament were originally manuscripts written by various Jewish and Egyptian authors.  Each
book bears the name of its writer, with the exception of the books of
Genesis, Kings, Chronicles, Jonah, and a portion of the Psalms.
These were originally written on soft bark, palm-tree leaves, soft and
iml)ressible stones, and various compositions, among which were
those of which the Egyptians made their hieroglyphical figures and
cornice work, such as were displayed in the interior of their temples
and of the temple of Solomon.  There were very many more manuscripts written than are preserved, or than those of which any knowledge is to be had at the present day.  The manuscripts composing
the New Testament were produced and preserved in a similar manner, and the whole of them were collected about three hundred years
after Christ lived.
There was, however, before Christ, a council of Jewish rabbins,
by whom it was decided that all manuscripts of a sacred and traditional character that might be found in possession of any nation,
should be immediately collected.  At that time the interest taken in
manuscripts of a sacred character was such as has never met with a
parallel, excepting at one subsequent period, when there existed an
actual mania upon the same subject, and which period has been distinguished by some writers as the age of bibliomania.  The Jews
succeeded in collecting a vast number of writings, which they preserved for several centuries.  To these was superadded a collection
of about fifty gospels, or books relative to Christ and the apostles,
together with other historical and sacred records.  Some of these
are now found in the New Testament.  They were- thus preserved
be laid down, the observance of which will insure the permanent establishment of the
kingdom of heaven upon earth.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                555
until the year 325, when at the command of Constantine two thousand and forty-eight bishops assembled at Nice.
It is well to remark in this connexion, that these bishops were
nothing more than oiganized human beings, nor were they sufficiently
refined to merit many very high encomiums. After they had assembled, they were so violent and vociferous, that had it not been for
the emperor's presence, they would have engaged in open battle.
For each one had prejudices so strong in favor of certain peculiar
doctrines, and all were so anxious to have their pre-convictions prevail, that justice and purity were'entirely excluded from their proceedings, and were as far firomn their deliberations as mythology is
from the truths of the Divine Mind.  Constantine was obliged to
disqualify seventeen hundred and thirty friom  having a voice in deciding which books were and which were not the word of God: and
only three hundred and eighteen were left.  These decided that the
books which composed the Bible as subsequently known, were the
word of God.  Several books, however, have since that time been
rejected.  Out of fifty gospels then extant, they decided that those
only of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were worthy of being preserved; while they rejected entirely the books of James, Jude, and
the Apocalypse.  After this decision, Constantine arose and solemnly
declared that the same should be considered as sanctioned by the
Divine Will; and that the books thus fixed upon should thereafter
be implicitly believed as the word of God.  Those manuscripts that
were rejected (amnong which were three well-written gospels) were
committed to the flames.
In this general condition the Bible remained until the year 633.
During the interval there were frequent councils called, which frequently annulled the decisions of each other-each establishing new
propositions and passing new rules to be observed until the assemblage of another council.  Thus were produced, from time to time,
modifications in the form  of the Bible, as well as in the number of
books that were to be considered as composing it.
At the council of Toledo, in the year 633, the books of James,
Jude, and the Revelation of St. John, were received into the canon.
Then the Old and New Testaments were established in nearly the
same form in.vhich they exist at the present day.  They continued,
however, for many centuries unread and unknown by the mass of
mankind; and it was not until the fourteenth century that the first
English version was made.  During the intermediate period, portions





## p. 556 (#584) ############################################


556            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of the Bible were copied into the German, Danish, and Saxon languages. A thousand years elapsed after the council of Nice, before
the Bible became much known; and probably it would have sunk
into oblivion had not the art of printing been established in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  This at once afforded a means by
which those who were anxious for its circulation, and to have its
doctrines prevail, could accomplish their desires.
It is well known, however, that the priests of the Roman Catholic
church held this, what may be properly called " excellent soft bark,"
in their personal possession, and were very actively engaged in promulgating its teachings to the world, many of them seriously believing
these to be inspired.  They believed that they themselves were the
designed apostles of this great faith; and they taught their followers
to consider them as the instruments to perpetuate apostolic power,
prophetic wisdom, and heavenly teaching.  Hence they claimed the
power to cure diseased persons, and to be authorized to make believers, if not by preaching, yet by the sword, the stake, the rack, or
in a more honorable way, by their sacred inquisitions!  Thus these
doctrines continued to prevail until a Reformer arose.
And I would here remark, that had the pope been disposed to
grant this Reformer one simple request, the Reformation would not
have proceeded far, or interfered to any extent with the sacredness
of Catholicism.  But by the occurrence of a simple circumstances
this dissenter or protestant was raised up, who succeeded in establishing his cause by a peculiar decision of character, and perseverance, arising more from wrath and indignation than from a solemn
conviction of the justice of the work in which he was engaged. Thus
arose the first Reformer, who openly protested against the iniquities
of the then-prevailing system of religion.
After himt sprang up another, who differed slightly fionm the faith
and creed of the former, and interpreted, according to his conceptions
of truth, the teachings of the admitted sacred oracles.  Ile also succeeded in establishli:g his beloved faith, which in some respects is
true, especially in those relating to the knowledge and wisdom of the
Divine Mind, to his original design, and to predestination. But
that he was mistaken on some points is clear to every enlightened
mind.
Thus LUTHER and CALVIN embraced doctrines essentially different from the religion so long established, so tenaciously believed, and
so ingeniously promulgated by the Catholic priests.  Since the tine

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                557
of Luther and Calvin, many very important modifications have been
made in Christian opinions, rules, customs, ordinances, ceremonies,
and ecclesiastical organization, and these have most effectually operated in destroying the harmony and peace of mankind, and in casting a shroud of sectarianism over the world that is almost the last
indication of the death and burial of rational intelligence! The whole
world, physically, morally, and spiritually, appears to me at this
moment as being immersed in the dark and turbid waters of sectarianism, into which the liglht of reason and of divine truth scarcely
casts one relieving ray!  The whole is gloomy, desolate, and uncongenial! Man, it is true, is the lord of creation, the flower of
Nature; but alas, how poorly he sustains his position, and how
humiliating to reflect upon the present state of his mental possessions!
156. Thus, reader, you are believing a book voted as being the
word of God by three hundred and eighteen bishops, and sealed as
true by the emperor Constantine! You understand, now, the origin
and formation of what is called the " IHoly Bible," which means excellent soft bark. You understand, now, how that which can boast
of antiquity, can assume the ground of being sacred, and how, being
defended by a multitude of interested promulgators, it can defy the
yearnings of your thoughts to be friee, and set at naught all your
attempts at investigation.  You will now be able to bear it in mind,
that the Hindoo has a Bible which he venerates as much as you do
yours.  S6 also has the liohammncdan, and the Persian.  Each
equally impelled by prejudice and hereditary affection, will inquire,
" If you deprive us of our Bible, what shall we have in its stead?"
Beloved reader, there is a BOOK in which beauties and divine truths
are inexhaustible; a Book filled with texts that no Egyptian, Jewish,
Persian, or Hindoo priest or theologian can counterfeit; a Book
which can not be concealed- whose teachings can not be misapprehended, and whose results will be purity, virtue, morality, and celestial righteousness; a Book from which the whole world may derive
indestructible consolation, and learn of that Divine Essence which is
the Cause and Parent of human existence.  It will at the same time
unfold the unspeakable grandeur of your celestial habitations, each of
which will be only a sphere or step in the grand and magnificent
gallery that leads to the Flower of celestial Beauty, whose fragrance
is the perfection of an unchangeable,Universe.  Will you ask, then,
reader, what will be given you instead of a material book, composed

658             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of paper and impressed with type, when a UNIVERSE is open to the
researches of your aspiring mind?  Certainly nothing can be more
unreasonable than the superstitious claims that are in the world for the
teachings of a simple book, that can be altered in a thousand ways in
going througlh the operations of a press!  But there exists a BOOK
that teaches purity, morality, and immortality, and demonstrates the
loveliness of the GREAT CREATOR-a Book, too, that is as indestructible and unvarying as the constitution and divine qualities of
NATURE.
I have but a few more remarks to offer concerning the Bible, and
these aare as follows: It does not teach that pure morality which belongs to the nature of man, and which will result from  a superior
condition of the race.  From  this remark must be excepted a few
incidental expressions said to have been used by JEsus —such as
" the Golden Rule," —which was comprehensively taught six hundred years before, by CoNFUCIus, the Chinese philosopher. Again:
it does not prove immortt/lity; neither does it teach the mighty truths,
contained in the successive spheres or degrees of future existence.
Nor does it even present any substantial proof of the transition fiom
this ru(lirnental condition, to a higher degree of material and physical
organization; or in other words, it does not demonstrate a resurrection to a future life.  Nor does it present one proper conception of
the constitution, character, greatness, omnipotence, and majesty of
the Divine Mind.  Nor does it do justice to his works, except in
those meditations upon wvhich I have heretofore commented.  Nor
does it contain one substantial proof of an unvarying law upon which
to found a hope of ever being regenerated, or of ascending to a sphere
of more perfect and harmonious existence.  Nor does it teach that
holy virtue, morality, and refinement, which should receive the name
of religion.
This term religion,'however, is quite inexpressive, and needs, in
order to be understood, a brief definition.  The term ligo is a Latin
word, signifying to tie or bind.  Re-ligo is to re-tie or bind over
again, and make still stronger. The?n being attached, forms the word
rcligion, which means to bind and rebind, and make secure.  It is
well to say that, understood in'this sense, it has performed its office
most effectually.  For the term  "religion," indeed, implies little
more than being sacredly bound to sectarianism. The word as used
by commentators is very potent, and very expressive; and it may be
seen by these remarks that it is very aplplicable.

Thus the " Primitive History" is useful as a history of mythology,
ancient theology, false and imaginary deities-as containing accounts
of wars, pestilences, persecutions, desolations of cities, false prophesyings, long and tedious expeditions, most unjust assassinations, murders, adulteries, abominations, trials, afflictions, imagination, phantasm,
rebellion; as presenting information concerning oriental customs,
expressions, ordinances, prejudices, religious wars, martyrdoms, and
all kinds of injustice, immorality, and unrighteousness.  Viewed in
the light of a history, I say, its writers should be respected, and its
contents preserved. But as a theologicazl book it should not be read;
for it contains no absolute doctrine-and all those doctrines which
are supposed to be taught therein, are merely the false interpretations
given of it by various commentators in all ages since the book was
compiled for the exclusive use of the adherents of Catholicism.
Frotrnftlsificationzs I would rescue its teachings.  I therefore say,
the book is good as a history, and would not have done the least
harm in the world, had not forced interpretations been given of its contents, and had not claims been preferred in its behalf to a sacredness
which it does not claim for itself, and, as I can positively say, which
it does not inherently possess. ~
But the objection may arise, that some tribes and nations of the
earth know nothing of this book, and yet they are miserable, ignorant,
and wretched, in the extreme.  The answer to this will be hereafter
given and comprehended in the third part, or the Application, of this
portion of the work.
~ 157. I NOW proceed to give a true history of JESUS, from his
birth to his death, and to state the causes of so many unjust sayings
contained in the New Testament concerning him and others.
In Nazareth in Galilee, there dwelt a family but little known to
the world, or to the inhabitants of the town in which they resided.
The father, whose name was JOSEPH, was a very active and industrious mechanic.  He was a carver and sculptor, and was friequently
engaged in various branches of carpentry.  His associate, MARY,
was a very gentle and kindly-disposed woman.  They lived generally unknown, because of their domestic retire ment, and love of the
quietude pervading an undisturbed and happy home. They neither
possessed an affection for literature, nor for the study of any science

or philosophy that was then cultivated among the inhabitants, as derived from the Grecians and other enlightened nations.  It was in
this family that that little personage, about whose birth, life, and
death, so many marvellous accounts have been written, was born.
Not long after his birth, Joseph and his wife were disinherited from
the house they occupied, because of an unfavorable report that becamne extant, through the agency of some designing and evil-disposed
persons.  Before they left the house, however, Joseph dreamed that
it was proper for him and his family to journey into Egypt.
Previous to this journey, a necessary circumstance compelled
Mary to lay her child in a manger, in which place, as I am distinctly
impressed, lie lay not over forty minutes.  Joseph, not knowing
what else to do, obeyed the suggestion of his impressive dream, and
departed into Egypt.  They were not long there before a suitable
relief was procured for them, which induced their return, and established them again comfortably in their previous habitation.
It is well that all should bear in mind that dreams were supposed
in those days to be something more than the workings of the elements and imaginations of the mind, and the suggestions, especially,
of those dreams which were higllly impressive, were obeyed as a
voice firom an angel of the Divine Mind.
This much is related in the New Testament, in a truthful manner;
and the account there given is correct, with the exception of the interpretation that was given to these simple occurrences, by people
generally, and especially by the writers of this history.
But the New T'estament leaves two chasms in the life of Christ,
which are of great importance, inasmuch as they are periods in human life that as much as any other require attention.  Matthew and
others speak of his birth, and then are silent until they introduce him
into the presence of learned doctors and philosophers, in the temple.
And no account is given of him after this, again1 until lie became
thirty years of age; and then he is said to have begun his preaching.
It is plain, that fiom birth to the age of twelve years, and also from
the age of twelve to thirty, many most important occurrences might
have transpired, of which the world, throughl these sacred historians,
have not the least intimation.
After Joseph returned with his family, all his secular and domestic affairs were rendered agreeable and easy; and he was likewise
restored to the bosom of society, and was beloved as a worthy citizen.
No particular impression existed among the inhabitants concerning

their young and beautiful son, with the exception that he was generally admired for the perfect symmetry of his form and cerebral structure. I am presented with no such an occurrence as the command
related by Matthew to have been issued by HIerod. But as I proceed, the origin of this account will distinctly appear.  The child
was named JESUS —which was a name occasionally occurring, but
seldom admired, because of its association in the mind with the supposed spirit of an Egyptian deity, much worshipped by the priests
of the Sun, and spoken of in various portions of the second book of
Kings. His physical constitution was beautifully proportioned, and
he possessed a corresponding beauty of the mental faculties.
His general organization was indeed remarkable, inasmuch as he
possessed combined the perfection of physical beauty, mental powers, and refined accomplishments. He was generally beloved during
his youth, for his great powers of discernment, his thirst after knowledge, and his disposition to inquire into the causes of mental phenomena, of the conditions of society, and of the visible manifestations of
Nature.  He was also much beloved for his pure natural sympathy
for all who were suffering afflictions either of a physical or mental
character. His benevolence and love toward all without distinction;:
his constant yearning for the companionship of those who were considered good and righteous; his marked respect and affection for
those who were much older than himself; his constant visits to those.
who required relief from their afflictions; and his kind words of consolation to those who were depressed either by disease or unhappy
social circumstances-all contributed to render him an object of gen —
eral love and attachment.  These were the peculiarities which distinguished him from all other persons then living.
It is true that at the age of twelve years he was admitted to the
presence of the learned doctors.  There lie manifested some of his
powers of discernment, interior and natural philosophy, unsophisticated love, simplicity of expression, kindness of disposition, and luniversal sympathy and benevolence.  These he displayed withlall the
naturalness and spontaneousness resulting fromn the promptings of an
uncorrupted and purely-organized spiritual principle.  Hle answered
their pertinent interrogations with great benignity, promptitude, and
freedom of conception and expression.  What most astonished the
doctors was the demonstration of his philosophical conceptions and
mathematical powers —all of which were blended into a perfect sys —
tem by the pervading elemnent of his mind, wivhichli was LOVE.

~ 158. I would have the reader understand the reason why these
things were to be expected from, and were manifested by, him.  I
have related that Jesus was perfectly constituted, both as to his physical
and spiritual organization.  This being the case, his mental faculties
were early developed to a degree even transcending the capacities
of those philosophers in whose presence he showed forth his wonderful mental qualifications.  Even at the present time there is a youth
whose mind is in a similar manner prematurely developed, especially
hMs faculties of perception and causality, and his powers of mathematical
calculation.  He is in one of the eastern states-and is already surprising the learned doctors and philosophers by his astronomical and
mathematical powers. Frequently there are persons who have one
or more of the mental faculties fully developed while they are as yet
in a yout[lful state.  Many also have the power of perceiving material substances or colors, or reading, without employing the natural
organs of vision.  Others are capable of having the interior faculties
of their minds opened by being thrown into an abnormal condition,
which relieves the mind of much of its burdensome obstruction, and
renders it suitable for the influx of superior knowledge.  This fact is
at the present day arresting the attention of many observing doctors
and philosophers of the land.
JESUS while in youth, and especially at the age of twelve, possessed all those superior qualifications which many scarcely possess
when their interiors are expanded by the modern discovery of manipulations.  Hence I discover that he became noted, because of his
superior and highly-refined powers of discernment, together with his
gentleness, kindness, and sweetness of disposition.
After he had manifested his marvellous powers to the learned doctors
in this instance, be courted no longer their presence, and lived principally among his brethren, spending a large portion of his time in the
visitation of the diseased, depressed, disconsolate, and suffering inhabitants in various portions of the land.  He seemed to possess an
intuitive knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants, of mineral
and animal substances-of their use, and of the proper time and
manner of their application in the curing of various diseases.  This
qualification, however, he acquired during the period which elapsed
from the age of fifteen to thirty-three.  He also possessed a great
)Ahysical soothinlg power over the disordered or disconcerted forces
of the human system.  This was because of his superior physical
endowments.  Hence it is related in various places in the New Teq

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 563
tament, that he laid his hands upon persons, and they were cured.
When relieving the palsy, he is reported as having said, " Thy faith
hath cured thee: rise, take up thy bed, and walk."  Also he is said
to have laid wet sand or clay upon tne eyes of the blind, and thus to
have restored sight.  And in various other instances he is represented
as having made use of lhysical means to produce the cures which are
by his biographers and others insignificantly termed "miracles."
The reason is clear why those sacred historians employed expressions so mysterious and ambiguous-expressions which often did
violence to the human judgment by conveying ideas which reason
can never sanction.  It was the general impression, after he became
so noted for his many benevolent and charitable deeds, that lie must
either be actuated by the Spirit of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, or by the Evil One whom their imaginations had promoted to
an equal degree of almightiness.  Finally, it became so general a
belief that he was actuated by the first, that they designated him by
the title of " the Son of God."  Then the ignorant and uninformed
bowed with a trembling veneration at the mere mention of the name
of "JESUS, the Son of God," although many of them  had never
beheld him.
The inhabitants in those days were greatly inclined to extremes of
faith and incredulity. If any particular theory, principle, or philosophy, were presented for their consideration, they were accustomed to
embrace or combat it violently.  Thus it was that most of the Jews
despised Jesus, while others worshipjed h/im, and believed all the
marvels that had been related of him.  It is well to remark that Jesus
never professed to be what they make him to say he was. He was
a kind, amiable, and unassuming being, discarded by many because
of his superior and benevolent traits, and as much beloved by those
whom he immediately benefited by the smiles of his loving-kindness
and by his soothing power.
He often during his youth, and also after ascending to manhood,
preached for the purpose of consoling and instructing multitudes of
those who were depressed in spirit, and unfortunately situated in the
world.  One of those beautiful lessons of consolation and exhortation
is recorded in the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of Matthew —
where, with all the siniplicity of a confiding disposition, he consoles
the multitude by saying, " Happy are they that mourn, for they shall
be comforted; happy are the poor in spirit, for they shall see God;
happy are the peace-makers, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;'

{564          NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and in like manner he proceeds with his expressions of kindness and
of all those sentiments that might be expected firom the workings of
such a well-constituted mind. In his preaching he employed the
terms that were then in use, and he professed to be nothing more
than a teacher of pure and unadultered love, and also a general sympathizer with all who needed relief, consolation, and sympathy.
I am exceedingly attracted by the purity of his life, disposition,
teachings, and spirit of reform. He saw distinctly, and realized fully,
the unhappy situation of his fellow-men; and he yearned for the time
to come when there would be a new heaven and a new earth, wherein
might dwell righteousness.  He was anxious for the prevalence of
a general harmony of interests and action, such as would join in one
the whole race of mankind.  He desired that prudence and industry
should so reign throughout this material sphere, as that the desert
might blossom as the rose, and the wilderness bloom with a smiling,
inviting beauty. Thus he delighted to contemplate the establishment
of the spiritual Zion-the great Temple of Knowledge and Righteousness so feelingly spoken of, and so earnestly desired by, that
good and worthy writer, ISAIAH.  Such are the yearnings of all naturally-philanthropic bosoms.  Such are the aspirations of those exalted minds who behold the human race as a Whole, and in their
superior benevolence cherish no selfishness or pride.
~ 159. Thus Jesus lived, doing good to those who came and required assistance, exhorting those who were uneducated, and preaching to multitudes-not in the temple or the synagogue, because
those places were too pure for his deeds aud his philosophy — but on
the mountain and by the wayside; thus lifting up his voice in what
has before been termed " the sanctuary of the expanded earth and
the unfolded heavens."  He taught thus because he felt it an imperative duty devolving upon him to instruct the ignorant, and to deposite if possible that pure spirit of reform in the social world that might
result in establishing the beauties of the spiritual Zion, and in perfectin;g the qualities of the Tree of Righteousness. He felt prompted.to preach, what had been before conceived, that men should do unto
others as they would have others do unto them; and he desired that
the simple, good, and tranquillizing influence of this principle might
be deposited and developed in the bosom of every human form. He
desired that the day of righteousness should be ushered in, when
there would be no more pain, sorrow, or crying, for the old things

would all have been passed away, and all things would have become
new. And in the accomplishment of his desires, sin would be destroyed, together with that which bath the power of sin, that is darkness, ignorance, folly, imagination, imbecility, and every species of
sectarianism and unholy philosophy.
JESUS continued to obey those beneficent monitions of his mind
(which were to cure the diseased, to visit the fatherless and widows
in their afflictions, and to preach peace on earth and good-will to
men) until prejudice became so strong against him, that he was unable to proceed any further in his career of purity and benevolence.
He was censured by various learned, and, as they were thought to
be, very great, theologians, and was persecuted to a great extent by.he multitudes, who were exasperated from the workings of religious
prejudice against him.  So he was captured, brought before a council of judicature, who were all disposed to condemn him without a
hearing, for disturbance of the peace, for interference with their longcherished religious faiths, their social organization, their modes of
worship, their rites and ceremonies, their long and loud prayers to
Him whom they supposed to be the Lord of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, for blasphemy, and for doing deeds that were good on the
sabbath-day.  All these and many similar accusations were brought
against him; and they exhibited a spirit of persecution that will be
ere long fully exemplified in this nineteenth century. On these accusations they condemned him to die the death of a martyr!  And
as was the custom in cases of similar accusations in those days, they
crucified him, two others sharing the same fate with him.  During
the infliction of this most unjust penalty, the Jews manifested the
same spirit of sectarian vengeance, and the same desire for the destruction of all invasive philanthropy and purity of principle, that
will ere long be exhibited again.  Thus will be demonstrated the
existence of precisely the same spirit as that which characterized the
Jews of old, and the influence of this will clothe the rising and unborn generation in the armor of prejudice, hostility, and fanaticism!
Thus JESUS was a good man, a noble and unparalleled Moral
Reformer, considering him as disconnected from all those unjust
things that are in the New Testament recorded of him. He did not
profess to be the Son of God in any other sense than that of a branch,
as all are, of the great Tree'of universal and eternal Causation. He
did not profess to be directed and impelled by any other spirit than
that of Divine love, the germ of which dwells in every other being

566            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
undeveloped.  And to this principle, as existing in otllers, he ap
pealed so feelingly, in order that its qualities might be unfolded, and
that they might advance to the degree of refinement in love and wisdom then occupied by himself.  He was, then, A TYPE OF A PERFECT MAN, both in physical and spiritual qualifications.  But those
representations which make him more than this, I discover are all
tuntruce, and express that only which was professed for, but never
by him.
Thus, then, he died a martyr to the principles of truth, reason,
and virtue.  So likewise did Matthew, Paul, and others.  And it is
lamentable to reflect that the world has been guilty of such flagrant
injustice that even many in subsequent generations have been subjected to the torturing rack, to the stake, and to the dissolving flames!
Men have even rushed to the field of battle, and there, impelled by
envy and sectarian prejudice, they have potured out each other's life's
blood, thereby causing Nature to blush for shame for the degrradation
of her children!  Brethren have joined in open hostility, actuated
by no other cause than the terrible and fiery elements of sectarian
envy, prejudice, and local affection!  How  fearful, indeed, is the
gloom of the dark thought, that man has died a martyr to the natural
promptings of the spirit within, and to the principles of virtue, morality, and love!
I behold Jesus, then, as a great and good Reformer; as connected
with no marvellous or mysterious aristocracy, but as being born of
lowly parents, and fostered in the bosom of their domestic habitation;
as possessing intelligence to a surpassing degree; as manifesting
unbounded love, benevolence, and sympathy; as healing the sick,
restoring the blind, curing the lame, and visiting the disconsolate in
their afflictions; as preaching love, morality, peace on earth and good
will to men; as instructing the multitudes in the paths of pleasantness and peace; and as loving all and disliking none. I behold him
as being condemned, nailed to the cross, and dying a martyr to the
cause of love, wisdom, and virtue!  Such is one of the parts in the
great monument which an ignorant and misdirected world have
erected to their own shame and folly!
~ 160. I now proceed to account for the origin of those unjust
statements in relation to him recorded in the New Testament.
First, however, it is proper to introduce some considerations concerning the habits, customs, laws, ordinances, and states of society





## p. 567 (#595) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  567
then existing: for it must be plain to every mind that language and
forms of expression are governed by the general habits, ordinances,
and circumstances of any nation or society, and that the former are
changed to correspond with the changes of the latter.
It was a custom in those days to obey the main suggestions of any
impressive dream, with great carefulness.  Dreams were considered,
among all classes, as an inflowing of the thoughts of angels or invisible beings, who were monitors and prompters to those who'dwelt on
the earth.  Hence they believed that dreams were induced and designed by God for the purpose of having men obey his will. Of these
things I have spoken in different places before: still, I would refer
the reader to the older manuscripts of the Bible as containing many
illustrations upon this point.  Besides this, it was the custom  to
write or express a figure, parable, or representative, as being itse7f
true, instead of the thought which suggested the figure or representative to the mind.
Moreover, it was a rule in those days, especially among the Jews
and Samaritans, always to admit a proposition or statement when the
same appeared to be demonstrated by appeals to a number of incidental and known facts; and if any different account or proposition
were presented by a different person, it would be rejected without
investigation.  For a proof of this I would refer the reader to a very
valuable work written by Plutarch, in which he says, that if any person presents a proposition contradicted by another, the first should
in all cases be considered as true and valid, and the latter rejected,
because it-was not the first presented for consideration.  This, Plutarch says, was the rule recognised by the Stoics, whenever they
were called upon to investigate conflicting accounts or propositions.
It is well to add, that this is precisely the course pursued by many
at the present day.  They assume and believe that their~first impressions, or hereditary opinions, are true, and reject all new ones, unheard; at the same time making their previous opinions the standard
by which all subsequent propositions should be tested.  So it is
scarcely necessary to refer to early historians for the truth of this
relation, when the same is fully verified in every department of the
theological, scientific, and philosophical world at the present day.
Another custom was to consider the universally-prevailing impression concerning any person or thing, as being created and sanctioned
by the will of the Deity.  This belief at once unchained their marvellousness and credulity for an unlimited exercise upon any subject





## p. 568 (#596) ############################################


568            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
which appeared thus fully sanctioned; and such they felt it their
duty to venerate and promulgate without restriction.
It was also a prevailing belief in those days, especially among the
lower classes, that the earth was the centre of the Universe, and that
the stars, moon, and sun, were necessary appendages to the earth,
and that no other earth was in existence besides this.  On this
ground they accounted for so much attention, prompting, and guidance, as they supposed to be bestowed upon them by the Deity;
for they supposed that he invisibly occupied a position in the firmamnent for the purpose of guiding them into all proper ways, whether
such appertained to peace or to war.
Moreover, there were many sects existing in those days, each of
which was distinguished by some peculiarity, either as tb speech,
garments, habits of living, or some other mark, which served in all
cases to designate them, and to establish their exclusiveness.  The
Druids* were known by their peculiar simplicity of dress, and by
their holding their meetings in sequestered places. The worshlippers
of the Sun, and typifyers of the tower of Babel and of the temple of
Solomon, distinguished themselves by wearing garments that were
indicative of the degree of masonry or of mechanical perfection to
which each hlad arrived.  The Samaritans were distinguishled by the
length of their beards, and the style of wearing their hair, and also
by their peculiar religious sentiments. The Jews were distinguished
by their countenances, their dress, and by the mark of the covenant,
called the circumcision.  Thus exclusive classes were established;
and each nation, and especially the Jews, earnestly desired to be
considered as the favorites of God-the latter class claiming to be
the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in proof of which
circumcision was presented.  They also desired to monopolize the
general favors supposed to be directly transferred from God to mankind on earth.
Such was the condition of things when Jesus was born; and the
same continued during his life, and for many generations after his
death. And it was owing in a measure to the customs of societythe rules and ordinances of nations, and the modes and habits of thinking, that so many very mysterious, unjust, and unreasonable things
were believed, propagated, and written, concerning Jesus, and his peculiar manifestations of physical energy in the healing the diseased, and
* The lecturer incidentally remarked, that these were of the same stock with the
Druids of Gaul and Britain.

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                569
also concerning his superior love and wisdom which were expressed
with so much gentleness, kindness, and humiliation.  I am exceedingly desirous to impress on the reader's mind the importance of
these considerations, inasmuch as they constitute the key by which
may be unlocked the great mystery so long clothing the birth, life,
and death of Jesus.
~ 161. A long time elapsed after Jesus became noted for his
moral teachings and benevolent acts, before any inquiries were instituted concerning the peculiarities of his birth and early life, or concerning thile circumstances attending the same.  It is well to say, that
the chief inquiries, and the collection of facts, relative to the birth,
life, and deeds of Jesus, were not made until many years ajter his
death.  Therefore the gene}ral implressions of his early followers were
assumed as a basis whereon his subsequent historians and followers
predicated their faith and doctrine.  The unfavorable report concerning Joseph and Mary, heretofore mentioned, gave rise to the first
impression as to the illegitimacy of Jesus.  It was in consequence
of this report that Joseph was disinherited for a season; but after the
report subsided, he returned to his former home, and all the previous
impressions, were obliterated entirely, and no more was thought
upon the subject.
When the first inquiries were made concerning the birth of Jesus,
the conclusion, as derived from superficial testimony, was as follows:
That Jesus, doing good, performing many cures, and manifesting
great powers of intellect, must necessarily be supposed to be the Son
of the Good Spirit, or God.  In confirmation of this, proof was supposed to exist in the report referred to; and Mary, the mother of
Jesus, was supposed to have conceived, in her virginity, by the
breathing influence of the Holy Ghost.  And it was known that- Joseph had a dream which caused his departure into E)gypt; and this
was believed to be angelic instruction.  Jesus, it was thouLght, could
not have oeen so perfect as he was, without having an origin unlike
that of others.  And as he had manifested brotherly-kindness, and
accomplished benevolent acts, this was deemed conclusive evidence
that his origin must have been pure.  The conclusion, then, was
irresistible, that Jesus was begotten of the Holy Spirit, and born of
the Virgin Mary, and therefore was the Son of God.  And they
supposed that he was named Jesus because he was sent to save his
neonle from their sins.  All these things were retrospectively viewed

570            NATURE'S DIVINE ItEVELATIONS.
by the generation succeeding the death of Jesus, and were considered undeniable evidences of his miraculous conception, of his immaculate purity, and that he must have been the Son of God.  All
this was in perfect harmony with their prepossessions of mind.
Here the New Testament leaves the history of Jesus until he arrives at the age of twelve years.  But surely some things must have
been said to have occurred as connected with his life during this period.  But the accounts which were collected seemed too crude an
imperfect to receive a canonical sanction; and they were hence re
jected on account of their inconsistency and the unsound manner in
which they were recorded.  Some of the rejected books are still in
existence, and are full of marvellous relations concerning the childhood of Jesus, and the peculiarities which distinguished his whole
life.  Some of these stories are not worthy a moment's consideration,
inasmuch as they are derived from the marvellous and exaggerated
impressions hereditarily received by the persons who wrote them.
Among other things, it is related that while Jesus was a little boy,
and associated with other children, the stars were seen to follow his
course, while his companions were not in the least thus honored; and
that the moon appeared to trace and retrace her steps, following the
various movements of the boy Jesus: also that a peculiar illumination
was visible on his countenance, which would blind the eyes of those
near him: also that while a very little boy, he would with other boys
approach the streams, and of the moistened clay make birds and
other small forms; and it is related that those which were made by
the other boys would remain inanimate, while those formed by Jesus
would be immediately animated and transformed into beautiful birds!
It is also related that seeds which were deposited in the earth by his
hand would germinate and grow up in the space of thirty hours to
full maturity. Much is also said concerning many visions and dreams
that he had, all of which tended to confirm the opinion that hb was
the Son of God.
The account concerning Jesus being introduced among the learned
doctors is strictly true, but it was not written until after his death.
All the things accomplished by him which are called mitracles, were
related as such mainly by those who received the traditions from
those who were the ilnmediate followers and companions of Jesus.
It was a general belief that he was the person whom  many of the
earlier historians and prophets foretold.  Hence, in various instances,
quotations are made from their writings which seemed to have an imn




## p. 571 (#599) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                57]
mediate bearing upon, or connexion with, the things they had heard
concerning the birth, life, and deeds of Jesus.
The writers of the books in the New Testament could not resist
the conviction that Christ was thus miraculously born; and that inasmuch as he accomplished so many miracles, discoursed so eloquently, harmed no one, but did good to all, and died ignominiously
for his cause, he must have been the Son of God -the application
of this title being in accordance with the general mode of expression
and belief.  They likewise cherished the conviction that lie must
have been foreseen by the prophets of previous generations.  Hence
by research among their writings, passages were found which seemingly had a connexion with the prominent circumstances in the life
of Christ, which they were recording.  Therefore they made those
quotations with a serious conviction that they had immediate reference to the things which they were employed in relating.
~ 162. The history of the deeds accomplished by Jesus from the
age of twelve to thirty, was registered promiscuously in various books,
some of which are now called the Apocrypha of the New Testament.  These relate more miraculous manifestations of the physical and mental powers of Jesus than are recorded in the New Testament.  Yet they were written more from  hearsay than firom  actual
knowledge.  And I am impressed to say that the account of the ascension was also transmitted by others to those who wrote it, with the
exception of one account preserved on bark, and said to have been
written by Mark, who was present as an eye-witness of the occurrence.  For be it remembered that the art of writing was then understood only by a very few, and that paper, ink, and the art of
printing, were to them unknown. Hence the accounts impressed on
bark and other substances would in some instances remain untranscribed for one, two, or three centuries.  Some of these were preserved until a species of paper was invented upon which their contents were transcribed.  Very few persons were able to write; while
the vast multitude were only capable of conveying their thoug-hts
verbally: and the constant verbal delivery of these accounts subjected
them  to constant modifications.  Yet friom impressions thus traditionally transmitted, the subsequent writers produced those records
of which the world is in possession at the present day.
Still more emphatically am I impressed to say that the birth of
Christ as related, the correspondingly-inconsistent stories of his
youth, the accounts of the instantaneous cures effected by him, the





## p. 572 (#600) ############################################


572            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
pretensions that are made in his behalf in respect to his mediatorship,
and of his being in a superior sense the Son of the Deity —and also
the account of his literal ascension- are all strictly the traditional impressions imbibed and written of him, none of which are true as they
are related.  It is impossible to be in communion with, and possess
a knowledge of, the unerring and unchangeable principles of the Divine Mind, and at the same time admit the truth of these traditional
records. And it is given me to know that he who believes fully in
their truth is not in communion with the laws, purposes, and Essence
of the Great Positive Mind.  But he who is interiorly enlightened
concerning these, hesitates not to declare, from a serious conviction
of the judgment, that such things can not be true; for their very nature precludes their possibility.
While I am thus compelled to speak, I am none the less conscious of having myself supposed these things to be true, and of having believed them with a vast degree of veneration, while my mind,
like others, was tramnmelled by sensuous opinions and philosophy.
Yet now, having the external senses closed, and the perceptive powers of the internal opened, I am acquainted with those things which
in outward life appeared unaccountable mysteries.  These historical
accounts, concerning which I in common with others have had mysterious impressions, now appear entirely transparent, even to their
origin, and their confirmation in the minds of mankind.  And I now
rejoice to know that this superficial theology has not the least connexion with the Divine Essence, or Great Creative Cause, with his
laws, or with the great system of material and spiritual worlds.  And
the belief in these things forms no part of the theology which every
department of Nature and the Universe unequivocally demonstrates
and establishes.
Now mny affections are directed entirely by that wisdom  which
discards a theology so impure and superficial.  Yet when I return
again to the exterior world, and know things only by sensuous impressions, then also will my affections return and control my superficial wisdomn; and these affections will at once connect me again
with all those superficial views, theories, and philosophies, that at this
present moment occupy no tangible position in my conceptions of
the structure of the Universe, or of the character of the Great Positive Mind. Hence, while I am in this condition, I am knowledging
that which is opposed to the present affections of men, in the departments of theology and philosophy.  But it is nevertheless proper

nay, it is an imperative duty-for me to develop that which I now
perceive is seriously interfering with all social happiness and mental
progression.  Let it be, then, the serious effort of all vigorous minds,
to learn soon to modify their affections for supposed truths, so that
their reason, and not their prejudices, may in all cases be the governing principle of their minds.  These developments will then lose
their apparent irreverence, and become at once a vehicle to convey
to the judgment truth and wisdom. I will have occasion to speak
on this point again, when treating on the physical and spiritual constitution of man; but at the present time it is necessary still further to
confine the attention to those things heretofore investigated.
~ 163. The men who are called prophets were reformers and philosophers in respect to subjects appertaining to the sufferings of humanity.  Hence, while situated among those sufferings, they consoled
themselves and others by endeavoring to forget the past, or by considering it as an index to a new and more desirable era. Their writings, then, are prophetical on the same principle that all inductive
reasonings are; and on this principle they anticipated a day of human
industry, of righteousness, and of general knowledge.  And as they
were subject to the tyranny of despotic rulers, their minds soughlt
refuge in the hope that a new king of the Jews would appear, whose
reign would give them relief, and change their physical condition.
Hence the king of the Jews of whvlom they spoke, and whose generation Isaiah indulged great hope of beholding, was exemplified in the
great Reformer, JEsus.  But they saw him  not, nor the distinct
period of the amelioration; but they were interiorly enlightened sufficiently to recognise the progress of those laws which would as a
necessary consequence usher in the King or Reformer whom  they
c-ntemplated, and the era which they so ardently desired.  Christ,
then, in the New Testament, is called " the King of the Jews;" but
the latter believed not that he was their predicted king.  Yet the
writers of the New Testament supposed that Christ should be thus
designated and promoted, because no other being had ever lived
among them who had displayed all those righteous qualities and
those manifestations of supreme love that in any way corresponded
to the predictions or impressions of the earlier generations.
Understand, then, that the New Teslament was written in such a
manner as to convey the impression that Jesus was the being actually foreseen by previous writers-in confirmation of which the

words of those writers are quoted.  Meanwhile remember that the
men called prophets knew  not of the person, nor the period, but
knew of a person and a period, which, according to the progress of
all things, must inevitably be ushered in.  And distinctly does it
appear that JESUS possessed those reforming characteristics which
constituted him A PERFECT MAN; and that he well represents the
King or Reformer spoken of by the prophets as being the Tree of
Righteousness, and the founder of the Spiritual Zion.  But the era
when were to be developed those principles which he exemplified,
was not when he lived, but is to be in future.  And only can this
occur when society has attalined to that perfect symmetry of form and
structure which was exemplified in the body of Jesus, as then alone
will the spiritual possessions thereof be correspondingly perfect.
According to the custom of those days, Jesus spoke parables,
which appeared to have allusion to occurrences thereafter to take
place in a manner corresponding to the letter of the parables.  The
prediction recorded in Matthew conrcerning the destruction of Jerusalem  and the temple, contains many ambiguous expressions and
illustrations.  These clothe the prophecy in a very mysterious garment, which to the general mind is rendered the more so because it
is recorded in the New Testa1ment. T''he parables of the sheep and
goats, the rich man and the poor one, the gehenna of fire, &c., are
all related as being spoken by Jesus to represent literal occurrences as affecting man in the material and spiritual world.  And
they do convey this impression, merely because they are expressed
in a style as if the parable or illustration was itself the actual occurrence referred to.  This was a customary mode of representing an
occurrence or discoursing upon any principle in those days.
BLut this much is clear, that no good and well-informed mind will
ever draw lines of demarcation between any human beings.  Therefore it is doing great injustice to the loving-kindness and unbounded
sympathy of Jesus, to believe that he employed such expressions intending them to be literally understood; for, as has been before
stated, he was one of those well-developed beings whose sympathy
and benevolence gushed forth spontaneously, and flowed irrespectively throughout every recess of human existence.
Herein, again, is the test of knowledge and righteousness: He
who is ignorant, and whose sympathies are contracted by prejudice;
twhose benevolence is circumscribed by the circle occupied by any
sect or institution; whose feelings, being perverted by local affec

tion and prejudice, are unmoved by the calls of mankind for amelioration -will fix the line of eternal distinction between mankind, and
presumptuously calls one class "the wicked," "tlle sinful," "the
abandoned," and the other'" the righteous," " the children of God,"
"the elect."  All but the latter class he will call hypocrites, deceivers, and all kitnds of unholy names, which naturally are conceived by
an ignorant and misdirected mind.
But he whose movements in the world of thought are unrestricted;
whose sympathy flows to all, without distinction, excited by a knowl-?dge of human weakness and misdirection; whose feelings and
affections are but gushing aspirations for universal peace and indusxy; whose energies of soul are concentrated upon the great era of?hysical and mental fireedom and exaltation -he it is that is truly and
purely enlightened.  Such a one knows no aristocracy, no distinction, no condemnation as a punishment, no bliss as a reward; but
recognises the truth, that all causes do inevitably produce corresponding effects.  Therefore he makes no distinction except that
which Nature establishes by her laws of association.  The mind
which recogrnises all these things is the highest development of Nature, and should be admired because of its purity and unsoplitication. Then, I say, if Jesus, firom a conviction of his judgment, made
any actual distinction, such as the language attributed to him would
indicate if literally understood, he must be numbered with the ignorant and uneducated, who occupy no very high position in the sphere
of thought and wisdom.  On the other hand, if he uttered not those
expressions which are ascribed to him, except for the purpose of
illustration, then he may have been that pure and truly enlightened
being whom the world at the present day is striving to know, to
appreciate, and to follow.
~ 164. To speak still more plainly: All impure, ignorant, and
improperly-instructed minds, can, without hesitation, condemn a
portion of the race, and presume to stigmatize them  as Pharisees,
hypocrites, evil-doers, and workers of unrighteousness.  But that
mind which is pure, and properly educated in the ways of wisdom,
can only recognise mankind as a Brotherhood; and he will consider
their imperfections as owing only to the misdirection of their physical and mental powers.  A knowledge of this truth breathes a universal sympathy and forgiveness; and the mind possessing it can not
but recognise the principle of doing good unto all, anc loving one

another.  Whoever says, then, that Jesus ever used such expressions in a literal sense, as is generally taught by theologians, virtually
charges him with being an impure and unrighteous man.  But he
who believes not these things, may consistently admit Jesus to have
been a good man, and a natural philanthropist.
I discover, however, that these things were not recorded until
sometime after the death of Jesus, and then wvere written according
to the traditional accounts received by the writers; and they were
expressed in a manner corresponding to the customs, beliefs, and
modes of expression, prevalent in those days. I perceive it is proper
to affirm, that this language was employed by Jesus to convey his
conceptions in a style suitable to be understood by the multitudes
who listened to his preaching.  The language presents no particular
principles capable of being applied to the world at the present day.
And it would indeed be a mark of wisdom, and a good sign of a
mental resurrection from  ignorance and superstition, if theologians
and commentators would discard all further effort to draw instruction
from those illustrations that were only useful nearly two thousand
years ago.
In respect to the origin of the account concerning the ascension of
Jesus, it is at the present time not important that I should enter into
particulars; especially as former comments lead to a solution of this
question, and also exclude the possibility of such an actual occurrence.  I will refer, however, for a detailed consideration of these
and kindred subjects, to a work that will hereafter be given, as devoted to a discussion of minor and general opinions and principles.
Here, then, follows a summary of that which has already been related concerning Jesus: The account given of his birth sprang from
an unfavorable report in the neighborhood where Jesus was born,
concerning his illegitimacy.  This is its origin; but the style in
which it is recorded, is a creation that arose from those general impressions concerning him entertained by those who wrote. The alleged
prophecies concerning him, quoted from the Old Testament, were
not originally intended to be thus applied; but they were cited by
the biographers of Jesus because they had a seeming appositeness to
some of the circumstances of his life.  They were suggested to the
writers of the New Testament as having an allusion to Christ, because they believed that past and present revealments formed one
perfect system  of inspiration and theology, as derived from the Divine Being. This was merely a conviction of their minds caused by





## p. 577 (#605) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 b77
the seeming evidence afforded by every external, superficial, and traditional indication.  The accounts given of miracles also derived
their character fiom the customary.use of language in those days,
which was to associate cause and effect in one sentence, without
alluding to the intermediate period which elapsed between the application and the result.  Of this, also, I have spoken before.
Those passages which speak of Jesus as being the Son of God,
and of his making those vast distinctions between men, are merely
expressions employed by those who wrote their convictions concerning him, and are worthy of no more attention than may arise from the
fact that they embody the opinions of men who lived many hundred
years ago.
Moreover, it becomes necessary to mark the very great injustice
that such accounts do to the character and life of Christ.  It is certainly doing no good to any being to claim for him an illegitimate or
supernatural origin.  Nor does it do any credit to his character to
relate the many inconsistent things that are reported concerning his
youth, his deeds, his preaching, and his death.  Besides, it is abso, —
lutely inconsistent with the high moral sensibilities of an enlighteined/
judgmnent, to clothe the life and preachings of Jesus with the things
that are now known to be believed only by those who are ignorant,.
misdirected, or prejudiced.
A belief of many things related of Jesus, not only does injustice
to his birth, life, wisdom, and benevolence, but it removes the Great
Moving Principle of the Universe from his exalted position to a gradel
only worthy of an ignorant and capricious potentate.  It depreciates the character of the Divine Mind, by making hiln institute a
system of theology merely to change that which he himself created
imperfect in the beginning of human existence.  It makes the Uni —
verse an inconsistent, disorganized, and unholy mass of creations. It
destroys the harmony of the Divine Plans, by teaching that the Deity
has interfered with'his established laws, instituting new ones to destroy those which he previously establishedl.
It likewise teaches that the Divine Mind and his Son have both
failed to accomplish the End to attain which they are represented as
having made active efforts.  For the "miraculous conception" can
never be believed so long as Nature continues her unvarying manifestations; and this doctrine can never be of the least possible use in
effecting a physical or mental elevation of the race.  It rather has a.
contrary tendency, inasmtlchl as it inspires feeble muinds witl  awe,,
37

578            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
fear, and superstition.  And if the "miracles" were intended to
prove the divine power of Christ, and to establish a divine theology
in the world, then have they proved ineffectual; because in the enlightened mind they neither establish a belief in a Divine power as
possessed by Christ, nor convey any conviction in favor of what is
supposed to be the true theology.  And if Christ was what they
represented him to be, anid if all the contents of the New Testament
are true, the miracles can not make them  more so.  On the other
hand, if they are not true, no miracles nor anything else can ever
make them true. And, moreover, if all those things related of him
are literally true, then he is proved to have been an impure and undeveloped being, even firom  his birth upward.  Moreover, if they
are true, that which I am now saying can not possibly affect their
intrinsic truthfulness.
This much, however, it is well to know: that that which Reason
and Nature sanction, should be believed in preference to that which
is contradictory of all known laws, and is incompatible with the harmony which pervades the Universe.  Therefore it would be doing
Christ injustice to believe concerning him all that is related in the
New Testament.  Yet those who wrote these things were perfectly,honest, and were impelled only by a sense of dtlty and zeal to write
their serious convictions, and present them to those who wished to'know what they believed, and fiom what source sprang their convictions.  But there is no evidence connected with the origin of these'records to justify the belief that they were ever intended for universal
reading and comment.
~ 165. There exists no history or account of the birth and teachings of Jesus corresponding to that which is recorded in the New'Testament, with the exception of the account in Josephus; and that
occupies no conspicuous position, but is merely recorded as a pas-.sing remark of no very great importance.  Some have supposed that
this passage is an interpolation.  I do not discover that this supposition is true; for the record is genuine, although not contained in
some of the early versions of Josephus.  Yet it is clear that this historian attached no such importance to the life and character of Christ
as was attached thereunto by those who wrote the gospels:  It is
reasonable to suppose that if the birth and life of Clirist had been
of such a supernatural character, more historians would have re-'ceived conviction accordingly, and would have devoted considerable

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 579
portions of their writings to a relation of his miraculous manifestations, setting forth the importance of his birth, death, and resurrection.  But as no more historians devoted themselves to this work,
the conclusion inevitably follows that few, if any, firmly believed
these things, except those who wrote the primitive manuscripts of
the New Testament; and that the latter believed because they received a mass of apparent evidence which no others were in a situation to receive.
The object of speaking concerning these things is to free the minds
of men firom all superstitious prejudice as connected with a belief in
the same, which prejudice has a tendency to retard the physical and
spiritual development of mankind.  Society can not be reorganized
in harmony with the laws and requirements of Nature, until all obstacles are removed which obstruct the unfoldings of the general
mind, and stand in the way of universal action: and this superstitious
belief in an unreal theology is one of those obstacles that are to be
of all others the most dreaded and the most repulsed from the bosom
of mankind.  Such obstacles can be removed only by cautiously revealing the causes engaged in their creation; and a knowledge of
these will cause the mind to repulse and discard their effects as
these are existing at the present time in every portion of the world.
Therefore I lhave descended to the causes that were engaged in
creating the book that is now called the Bible; and a knowledge of
these removes at once all that superstition concerning it, and all
those ideas of its supernaturalness, that have preserved it in the bosoni of fanaticism  fiorn the period of its origin to the present day.
The effects of these causes have been folly, ignorance, prejudice,
bigotry, superstition, injustice, wretchedness, immorality, and aristocratic distinctions, among the various nations of the earth.  Now he
who can sympathize with these effects, may still continue to cherish
their parent causes; but lie who feels an inward repulsion at the very
thought of their existence, will most certainly display his nobleness:)f mind in discarding for ever those unholy causes which produced
them, as well as the effects themselves, and begin to live a new life
in the physical and mental world, and thus be fitted to ascend to the
highest point in the second sphere of knowledge and understanding.
Still nothing should be venerated more than the beautiful and
truthful prophetic meditations of the early writers concerning a universal deliverance firom tyranny, bondage, and wretchedness.  And
the many useful and beautiful moral pre'cepts contained in the New





## p. 580 (#608) ############################################


580            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Testament, as spoken by Jesus, demand equal reverence. All such
moral teachings should be regarded with deep veneration, especially
when that veneration is an offspring of the judgment, and not of the
affections; for the affections are not the developed principles, but
merely the elements of the judgment.
And it will be perceived that the nobleness of those early writers,
and the superior physical and mental endowments of Jesus, are still
preserved as a source of instruction, and that they even shine forth
with a brilliancy they never have before displayed, because they have
been so much obscured beneath a heterogeneous mass of unjust and
useless materials. And what has been preserved of their characters
and teachings is capable of being applied to the great subject of
Moral Reform, which is only to be affected by first reforming the
physical and social conditions of men. The beauty of their lives
and characters, the perseverance which distinguished their efforts,
and their adherence to the principles of virtue, goodness, and righteousness, even unto martyrdom-all stand forth as conspicuous
examples by which all men may profit.
And let it be known that JESUS was the greatest of them all in this
great field of labor-in this great vineyard of natural (not unnatural)
culture. He possessed pre-eminently those ennobling attributes
which are worthy a living imitation in the lives and deeds of all
men.  I therefore place Jesus and these early writers or prophets in
the same category with those worthy and noble philanthropists who
have lived sinc.e their time, and those who still live to adorn the
world.  They were general sympathizers with the afflictions of men,
general actors for the public good, general relievers of the widows
and fatherless, general preachers of the great principles controlling
the Universe and Man with an unerring government, and general
relievers of despondency and mental wretchedness, by unfolding to
the minds of men the great and glorious era when would exist universal peace, industry, and righteousness.
And it is an honor to the human race to become now acquainted
with the pure characters of former days, as disconnected from all the
extraneous obscurities that have shut out their real characters from
the mental perceptions of the world.  It is an honor now to know
and appreciate the trueness, goodness, brotherly-kindness, and benevolence of JESUS, as disconnected fiorn all the falsifications beretofore obscuring his intrinsic physical and spiritual qualifications.
Thus I close all reflections on the character and application of the

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               581.
principles of the early writers, and of JESUS, until the delivery of the
third part of this work.
~ 166. THE foregoing considerations in reference to theology, and
the misconceptions that exist in the world, have so far advanced the
subject as to render necessary, as next in order, some reflections
upon many revelations that have been made in past ages, by various
persons vwho were qualified for the inflowing and the outward expression of truths.  In all ages of the world, revelations of various
degrees of importance have been made, though in many instances
the world knew it not.  I discover that more have been given than
are recorded in the Bible; and some of these, too, were of the most
important and instructive nature: although in the Bible are contained many that have scarcely ever been excelled in any previous or
subsequent age.
It is proper for every mind to venerate revelations of every kind,
in proportion to their congeniality with the uniform teachings of Nature, and the highest sanctions of a well-constituted judgment.  And
in connexion with this remark, I would again enforce the absolute
importance of not bestowing veneration upon any revealments that
are to be found in the Bible, more than upon those found among the
productions of other writers.
The most useful revelations contained in the Bible are those given
by David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, Malachi, and Jesus. ISAIAH'S
mind was so expanded, that a knowledge of ultimate alleviation firom
physical and social wretchedness flowed into it with a natural ease,
with which also he expressed the same to the world.  But as the
application of his revelations will be made in the sequel, it is unnecessary at present to dwell upon theln. He should, however, be
recognised in this place as one of those spiritually-enlightened men
whose teachings to the social world have not as yet been appreciated
or justly interpreted.
And DAVID, too, instituted prophetical meditations that are worthy of the deepest attention and the highest respect.  And JEREMIAH, and likewise ZECHARIAH, revealed many things pertaining
to the same social resurrection, and to the grand and sublime results
in the moral world as flowing so naturally and spontaneously from





## p. 582 (#610) ############################################


582            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the harmony and unity of action that will ultimately pervade the whole
physical world.  And MALACHI also spoke briefly, yet truthfiully,
concerning the great and glorious era yet unrealized by the inhabitants of the earth, but wlhich, according to progressive law, may be
had in bright anticipation.
It is well to remark, in order to prevent misunderstanding, that I
use the terms revelation and devclopic7ent as synonymous; for a revelation is nothing more than an outward development of truths flowing
into the mind.
No being ever existed before JESUS, who possessed the same degree of spiritual elevation and refinement: for he possessed the highest development of the physical and mental powers. And it is plain
that no being ever revealed so much pure and substantial truth so capable of receiving an immediate and useful application. His mind,
as I have before intimated, was properly constituted for the inflowing
of truths, both from the natural and spiritual world.  Therefore his
superior judgment taught him to reveal only useful and natural truths,
relating to the social conditions and material constitutions of men.
For, as has been shown, he taught not the doctrine of immortality,
but only incidentally made mention of that truth when endeavoring
to inspire the human mind with hope and confidence. Jesus is to be
more respected and appreciated, and his principles more practised,
than they have as yet been.  The beauty of his natural principles
have never as yet been duly recognised, because. they have not escaped the darkening influence of theological interpretations.  And I
feel it proper to affirm that the beauty of his life and character never
has been nor never will be known, and fully exemplified in the lives
of men, until all speculation, both of a psychological and theological
nature. as connected therewith, is abandoned.  For the more this is
persisted in, the further his life, character, and principles, become
removed from the understanding and practice of mankind.  The distinction must be made between natural truth and spiritual imagination, before there can exist universal peace on earth and good-will to
men. If no more were revealed by Jesus than this consummation,
the high illumination of his mind would be sufficiently demonstrated;
because he spoke not of that which was, but of that which shall be
yet in future.
The use, therefore, of his principles, has not been comprehended
by those who profess to have the most knowledge of their utility and
application. And it now becomes important that men should discard





## p. 583 (#611) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 583
previous interpretations of his teachings, and press onward to the
consummation, when their truth will be triumphantly demonstrated.
I recognise tile revelations made by JESUS as more useful, more
truthful, and more natural, than any of those who have presented
different or higher truths to the world.  What I mean by higher
truths is, such as are involved in many of those metaphorical allusions in the Apocalypse —which are incapable of benefiting the world
of mankind, though they are susceptible of being fully verified in the
third sphere of spiritual habitation.  Notwithstanding their truth, they
are impracticable, and therefore they demand not that attention and
veneration which have been given them by many erudite commentators. It has been proved that the Apocalypse contains no principles
that are intimately connected with any other revelation, with the exception of that made by Emanuel Swedenborg.
~ 167. Many revelations have been made by persons among
the Chinese, Hindoos, and Persians.  CONFUCIUS revealed many
moral principles which have not an equal in any revealinent except
that of Jesus.  Also BRAMA revealed many interior truths that have
not as yet been, but will be, verified, both in the social and spirit
world.  Many truths are obtained even unconsciously to the person
who  receives  them, by implication, induction, and progressive
thought.  And in like manner do men sometimes become subjects
or agents to reveal truths altogether unknown and unbelieved by
themselves, but which are, nevertheless, in subsequent ages, discovered to be truths of the most astounding character and the greatest
intrinsic worth.  Thus it was with ZOROASTER -who revealed and
taught to the whole eastern world, that sin would ultimately be abolished, and everlasting righteousness brought in; and that then the
Deity (Ormuzd) would rejoice with joy unspeakable for ever and
ever.  Never was a greater truth proclaimed to the inhabitants of the
earth: and for the accomplishment of the end which it contemplates,
the most active efforts should be employed.  Yet this is not venerated, merely because it was presented by Zoroaster- he being, notwithstanding, an agent or subject by and through which this most
important revelation was made.
Also MOHAMMED declared many spiritual truths-truths that have
been verified by psychological research, and also by the spiritual developments of Swedenborg. Yet. again, these truths are not revered,
merely because the revelation has proceeded from Mohammed, and





## p. 584 (#612) ############################################


584            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
because hereditary impression and education preclude all affection
from the truths and their revealer.
A few centuries ago, many physical truths were revealed by GALEN-truths, too, that are susceptible of the most useful application.
These relate to the trinity of principles or substances as forming any
one compound or organization. This trinity is discoverable in every
department of Nature and the Universe.  This does not, however,
in any way demonstrate the supposed spiritual Trinity that has been
so seriously defended, so ably discussed, and so reverentially cherished. Galen, then, revealed that which no other physician or physical researcher ever did; and he is worthy of being classed with
those revelators who occupy the highest position in the departments
of useful and natural truths.
I find also many important discoveries and revelations amlong the
Germans-owing very much to their peculiar habits of ihinlking, and
of investigating all seen and unseen laws and operations of Nature;
and ainong them have been persons whose interior perceptions were
so unfolded as to enable them to recognise the reality oftlthe spirit
world, and its close connexion with this rudimental sphere.  One
should be noticed particularly, because her mind was in a condition
occupied by all at the period of death or transformation.  She is
known as the SEERESS OF PREVOnST-and has revealed many
truths concerning the connexion between the natural and spiritual
world, and between the soul and the body; and concerning the powers of spiritual perception, and the medium by which the spirit is
united with the form.  These things are too important to escape the
attention of any inquiring mind; for they manifestly involve evidences such as mankind at present need to satisfy then) of the powers
of the soul, and of other physiological truths.
MARTIN LUTI-ER likewise revealed some truths that are very
useful, practical, and important. Yet error preponderates in his plroductions, and these, therefore, are not worthy of so high a degree of
attention and esteem.  His mind, like that of CALVIN, was changed
by a very sudden conception that what he was educated to believe
was not all true.  This conception at once inspired new faculties of
the soul, and the whole resulted in the development of many truths,
which, though mingled with errors, deserve the title ofrerelations.
~16S. The French have also produced unfolded minds, whose
revelations demand equal attention and respect.  The systern o0

Nature and philosophy of human social existence and harmony, by
BARON  D'HOLBACH, is a production worthy of attention and
respect, because of its beauty of expression, sublimity of sentiment,
and expansiveness of philosophy.  And I hesitate not to affirm, that
he is the author of many revelations too capable of a beneficial application to be ever lost or forgotten.  His conceptions, however, are
not all true, nor are his conclusions all perfectly legitimate as dedhced
from the basis assumed, which is true. Hence his production contains a mixture of error and truth. Yet the truth preponderates; and
this should, therefore, be recognised, appreciated, and duly acknowledged.
France has produced many very learned men in the superficial
attainments of life.  And their philosophies are not of the purest and
highest order, merely because they partake so much of the external
and sensuous in their processes of investigation. Such a mode of investigation is not to any great extent calculated to unfold those moral
truths and progressive principles that will harmonize the human
family, and unfold the beauties of the spirit world.
There is one, however, whose teachings I can not fail to recognise
as the most useful, most truthful, and most exceedingly sublime,
even as seeking a level with, and being confirmed by, the teachings
of Jesus. This is the great and noble Reformner, CHARLES FOURIER
-whose capacity of soul and extent of revelation have not as yet
been perceived to any great extent by mankind.  His mind was
superiorly constituted and developed; for a proof of which, see his
unparalleled disclosures concerning the unspeakable harmony that
pervades the Universe, and concerning the reciprocal action of all
bodies, which, to express it in his own language, " breathe a melody
of harmonious sounds, like an instrument well tuned, and every note
touched in unity by wisdom." And, says he, the harmony of the
Universe is developed and displayed in the planetary systen; for
each planet occupies a position, and plays a part in the great system
of united action, as the notes of a well-tuned instrument.  And as a
tune can not be played unless each note is properly adjusted, and
occupies a position in reference to the rest suitable to produce hlarmony and melody, when a tune is thus played, the Universe is at the
same time represented.
Then he proceeds to reveal the all-important truth, that as harmony
exists among all the bodies of the Universe, so can it prevail among,
and join inseparably, the inhabitants of the earth.  And he proceeds

586            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
to assure the world, by mathematical demonstration, that every note
exists in this animated sphere; and that each note needs only to be
properly placed, in order that the whole race may, like a perfectlytuned instrument, move in harmony, melody, happiness, and unity
of action.
Behold, mankind, these sublime and eternal truths crushed and
almost entombed in the dark mass of prevailing ignorance, prejudice,
and fanaticism! Hear ye not, when a noble and expansive mind,
like that of CHARLES FOURIER, demonstrates the interior truth, even
to your senses, that the world of mankind is composed of the requisite
notes to play a perfect tune of peace and harmony?  And observe
how gently, seriously, and cautiously, he informs the world that these
notes can only be properly placed by following the light of wisdom
and knowledge!
He also mathematically analyzes the developments of each planet
in our solar system, and proves that the mental advancement of the
inhabitants of each must necessarily constitute such a Brotherhood
and such an association of congenial parts as to render the whole an
harmonious existence, such as he expended his powers to have accomplished on earth.  And I have the means of knowing that his
general conceptions were strictly true as regards the inhabitants of
the planets belonging to our solar system.  And it becomes me in
justice to sanction and confirm that which he proved true by the dissimilar process of mathematical induction.  I therefore affirm that
his statements concerning the harmony and unity existing among the
inhabitants of the planets, as to their social condition and mental culture,'are decidedly and unequivocally truc —being in no essential
particular discrepant with those things which I have revealed concerning the world, Nature, and the Universe.
I am drawn to that person whose wholb physical and spiritual
powers were devoted to the great work of moral reform.  Such was
CHARLES FOURIER: and those things which he revealed are capable of being applied in improving the social condition of man, and
their truth will be demonstrated in the moral consequences of the
perfect restitution to peace, harmony, and pure principles, for which
he labored.
Concerning this very noble personage, and his philosophy, more
will hereafter be related, especially when the principles of his microcosmogony tnake their appearance prominently in the third part, or
application, of this work.

~ 169. I am also impressed to recognise the important revelations
made by and through EMANUEL SWEDENBORG, the Swedish philosopher and psychologist.
His mind possessed many superior endowments, and lie presented
to the world many pure and healthy principles.  Some of his revealments, however, will be capable of an application only when the race
advances to a high degree of social and mental refinement. His mind
was interiorly expanded, which fact enabled him to receive and express many interior truths connected both with the material and spiritual world.
I discover more practical utility in his scientific and philosophical
revealments than in any other of his productions.  No work should
be more esteemed and generally read than a book written by him
entitled " Thle Economy of the Alnimal Kingdom," in two volumes.
The first volume presents a close and severe analytical investigation
of the three functions performed by all animated bodies; in which
lie develops that order of " end, cause, and effect," which are alike
observable in all portions of the creations of the Divine Mind.  He
plainly reveals that the end, or ultimate design, is the primary cause
of all movement.  A knowledge of the end prompts and procures
the means, which are the secondary causes: and the action of these
produce the effects, which are the ends predetermined to be accomplished.  The end or object to be accomplished is in every instance
the creator of the causes and effects that are instituted-or of the
means and effects combined as one in accomplishing that which was
the original cause of the institution of both.  This much is clearly
revealed in the first part of his work;and is true, useful, and will be
acknowledged and applied to the necessities of human existence.
The second part is devoted to a consideration of the three functions of the animal kingdom —their interior, mediatorial, and exterior
qualities, as performing their respective offices and manifesting their
peculiar spiritual forces, with a mutual dependence upon each other.
Indeed, his revealments concerning the beginnings of power in the
human system  are beyond all general comprehension at the present
day.  He discourses deeply upon the cortical composition of the
brain, describing the glands or " little hearts" (as he calls them), as
constituting the cause of all motion or spiritual exercise in the material form, and describes how they expand and contract like the movements of the chest and heart.  And he demonstrates the reciprocity
of the systolic and diastolic motions of the cortical glands of the brain

588            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and that they are the beginnings and causes of all corresponding
movements belonging to the animal economy.
The last portion of this valuable work is devoted to some very- ra.tional and truthful intimations of a psychological character, and concerning the powers of the human soul.  It contains a very clear and
lucid explanation of the distinction between the nature and powers
of the soul and spirit as connected with the human form; and it likewise exhibits a very gentle emergement from the material into the
spiritual sphere of thought and investigation.
I am led also to notice a still higher spiritual development of the
same kind which is presented in the latter portion of his " Animal
Kingdom:" and that is found in his production entitled " True
Worship and Love of God." Nothing can evince more substantial
purity of meditations and superior conceptions of the mind than this
very impressive and well-constructed work. It flowed, as it were,
spontaneously from his high reverence for those unspeaking truths
contained in the animal creations. And this work is indeed a revealment much to be read, appreciated, and practised.
After the period which was occupied in writing these works, his
mind became exceedingly exalted, and all its powers of conception
were absorbed completely in the phenomena and truths of the spiritworld.  The truths that he thus reveals concerning these things are
in very many particulars susceptible of benefiting the human racethough this can not be said of every general feature of his psychological system. He revealed those spiritual truths that will be verified in subsequent lectures: but only in a general and correspondential manner.  For I now discover that many of his interior disclosures
are not in the least particular comprehended even by those who at
the present time are most actively engaged in their advocacy.  And
I am impressed to say that if, instead of conveying the idea that
he unfolded the spiritual and interior teachings of the Bible, he
had said that he unfolded the spiritual and interior teachings of _Nature, the world would sooner have approached his sphere of reason
and knowledge: because then the connexion would have been more
distinctly observed between the material and spiritual world.  But I
am not able to discover any such interior meaning in any portion of
the contents of the Word as he represents.  And if objection is made
to any of these sayings, as based upon the want of interior perception
which may here seem to be acknowledged, I would request the
reader to reconsider the explanation I have given of the interior





## p. 589 (#617) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                689
qualities of the Bible.  If, however, the objection be persisted in,
I refer for future demonstration to the ENCYCLOPZEDIA that will
succeed this book.
I am much drawn to the pure, gigantic, and powerfully-intellectua.,
spirit of SWEDENBORG.  His philosophical revelations are of vast
importance, because of their truth; and his spiritual and psychological revelations are also qual/fiedly true, and are susceptible of being
verified in the spiritual spheres, and will be in the disclosures soon
to follow.
I recognise, however, too much profuseness of expression —too
much repetition of correspondences and established principles-in
various portions of his works.  There is too much intensity of ardor,
and too much obscurity, ambiguity, and spiritually-inflated conception,
in his psychological works, for them to be of any particular utility to
the social world at the present time. But a proper and abundant supply
of the social requirements of mankind will so elevate their moral and
spiritual perceptions, that they will readily discover the signification
of his spiritual teachings, which at present, to the mass of mankind,
seem like the wildest hallucinations of a misdirected and inflated
mind.  Then in view of these considerations, it is impossible to conceive of the practical utility of his spiritual revelations to the disordered world at this present time.  The fact that they are not capable
of being comprehended is at least presumptive evidence that they are
not such truths as are at present required to benefit the social world.
Therefore I observe this gigantic mind as in its conceptions transcending completely the ordinary powers, even of all interiorly enlightened men, and consequently as being removed from the natural
into spiritual spheres.  Hence some of his mighty revelations will
only be known to be true when man ascends to a higher degree of
wisdom and knowledge. And as these things are so, I notice those
things only in his revelations that are adapted to the wants of the
social world, in order that mankind may be, as Fourier has expressed
it, organized according to the melodious, harmonious reciprocations
of a Brotherhood.
1.70. Many revelations have been made in previous ages, which
I can not now stop to notice.  And all these are in a greater or less
degree important and profitable as contributing to the general stock
of wisdom that mankind require.
It is proper, however, to briefly reflect upon the revelations of





## p. 590 (#618) ############################################


590            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
PLATO concerning the spiritual identity of man, and a future life.
It can not be doubted, when his whole philosophy is taken into consideration, that he revealed some very important laws in Nature, and
many psychological truths.  These, however, were much obscured
by the mingling of external and internal evidences: the first being
mostly the developments of circumstances, and the latter the unvarying movements presented in all parts of Nature that he investigated.
His mind was much clouded and his perceptions much darkened by
a vast number of hereditary impressions.  Yet his psycholorrical revealments make their appearance even through the many superficial
evidences which he accumulates in their favor.
Also those things unfolded by the interior reflections of XENOPHON
possess a high degree of beauty, truth, and profitableness.  No mind
ever was more deeply impressed with the truths of immortality than
his, because his convictions proceeded from the gushing aspirations
of the living principle within.  And hlis philosophy contains more
substantial reasons for this doctrine than are to be found in any portion of the Old or New Testament.  His writings are therefore useful and important to the world, because of their many truthlful intimations, these suglgestingr higher truths.
In the revealtlents of SocRATES I do not discover so much interior perception of principles, but more comprehensiveness in the
observance of superficial evidences; and the ideas deduced from
these are in many instances true, though illegitimate.
CICERO was also a defender of those -unvarying principles that
govern the Universe, a consciousness of the truth of which compelled
him to discard all superficial theories that then pervaded the general
mind, in the form of a mythological theology.  And he, like the former writers, should be very deeply esteemed and appreciated for
his pure and important revealments, of which confirmation may be
derived froom the interior perceptions of every enlightened judgment.
I discover a harmony in the revelations of each age, from the first
decided conception and expression of truth, to the unfoldings of the
present generation.  I discover, however, that each revelator has
presented truth in proportion to the favorable situations in which his
mind was placed, and the favorable developments to which it attained.  Yet that truth which is discoverable among the writings of
each, is confirmed with great simplicity in the moral and social
teachings of JEsvs, and in the corresponding teachings of CHARLES
FOURIER, who systematized those pure principles in order that they





## p. 591 (#619) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  591
might be reduced to practice, and thus produce a moral renovation
of the race.
Then, again, I discover the more superficial modifications of these
principles in the writings of SWEDENBORG, who proceeds to the interior, not so much of princil)les, as of their detailed parts.  Thus in
his writings are set forth the innumerable ramifications, both of things
and principles belonging to the natural world, and of the corresponding literal possessions of the spirit-world.  And as I have stated, 1
do not discover sufficient distinctness or naturalness in the writings
of this philosopher to render them susceptible of a practical application to the social requirements of the human race.  It is no more
than just in all such instances to enforce the question, " Of what possible use can any revelation be, that can neither be understood nor
applied?"  A revelation developing no practical principles existing
in the natural world as adapted to social life, can not be of any possible utility to the social or moral world.
From these considerations, the object of glancing at the writings
of each philosopher becomes apparent.  It is to point out the good
and practical parts of each, that they may be preserved for future application; and if these are duly distinguished and preserved, all the
unreal and excrescent parts of each revelation and philosophy will
at once be disregarded, because of their non-importance.
Since the existence of those men, many new and dissimilar theor:ies, hypotheses, and revelations, have made their appearance, both
in the scientific and theological world.  These have been of such a
nature as to disunite the modes of natural and social life firom the
moral principles of man.  Tlhis fact, again, demonstrates the nonutility of such revelations, inasmuch as they are destructive to the
social harmony of mankind, and to that pure morality which is inseparably connected therewith.
Again: Any theory or hypothesis having a tendency to disunite
the material from the spiritual, or the social from the moral, or to disunite in any way the human race, is entirely unprofitable, and should
be for ever discarded. For it is made plain from past investigations, that
a perfect morality can not be developed, unless the rudimental and
social condition of the race is first made suitable for its spontaneous development. It is, therefore, absolutely useless to promulgate theological systems of morality, when the causes relating to such are in direct
opposition to the required result.  Then, in order to benefit the
world, instead of being engaged in psychological investigations, men





## p. 592 (#620) ############################################


5-92           NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
should turn their attention immediately to the establishing of those
superior conditions in the social world, the effects of which will
greatly transcend their present anticipations. It is clear to every mind,
that the latter must be accomplished before the moral results so much
admired can, as a consequence, be permanently obtained.  In other
words, the social'and natural must be superiorly situated and organized, before the moral and spiritual elements of man can possibly be
developed to a proper degree.  The many revelations that are now
existing in the scientific and theological departments, are of minor
importance compared to the great and essential principles which
must be discovered and acknowledged before that social and moral
condition of the race can be attained for which all should strive.
It is proper to understand that the influx of principles into the
mind of a person or persons, is a result of the peculiar constitution
and development of such minds; and not that revelations of any
character proceed directly from  a Divine Source.  Therefore, he
whose mind is unfolded, or whose spiritual perceptions are extended
to a higher sphere of knowledge, comprehends more than ordinary
minds, because he perceives that which exists below his exalted
sphere of investigation.  Such see, also, that which would be of use
and importance to the world, and reveal it in order that it may be
applied.  Thus cvcry mind conceives and expresses truth in proportion to its degree of development, or of spiritual elevation.  Then
such revelations as the Apocalypse and those contained in many other
portions of the New Testament, together with many portions of Swedenborg's writings, can not, though true, be of any possible use to
mankind in their natural state.  \Thether they are or are not true,
therefore, they are unimportant.  Hence it is proper for every theologian and commentator, before devoting much time to such, to inquire their use, even admitting them to be of the purest origin and
the highest truth.
There are many worthy persons who have distinguished themselves in various departments of thought, whom  I am obliged to
leave unnoticed, for the reason that their cogitations are subordinate
to the object of these present considerations.  I am  impressed to
say, however, that those who have been active in unfolding the teachings of others will be specifically noticed hereafter.

~ 171. THESE revealments having proceeded thus far, a different
though connected subject may now be introduced. I have descended
into the interior history of mankind, discovered the origin of social
disunity, false impressions, unreal theology and consequent mythology, and have specifically considered the successive modifications of
each, until the whole presents itself to the generations of the present
century. I have spoken of man, physically and mentally, only as it
was necessary in order to elucidate the many causes of conditions
existing in the world.  I have not spoken particularly of the physical production and constitution of man, nor of those peculiar elements, qualities, and essential principles, that elevate him above the
animal creation, and that constitute and characterize that animated principle known as tile Soul, Slirit, or M3ind. I find it necessary
to generalize these, in order to establish the connexion between Nature, with its various lower forms, and Man, and between man and
the higher spheres. An inseparable unity and reciprocation of action
must be discovered and established between these, and then the whole'
social world may hereafter become a true representative of the grand
and harmonious movements of Nature and the Universe.
I have ascended, then, to the important question, What is Manm
MATERIALLY?  And the answer is, He is the wisdom, head, andi
King of all animated forms.-He is a perfection of matter.-*
I proceed to prove this proposition by descending to the interior
forms and substances that constitute the rudiments of all organic beings, and tracing them connectedly until they ascend and. become.
perfected in the human organization.'t
The first forms or particles that made their appearance after the
condensation of the matter composing the earth, were those constituting the mineral kingzdom.  This is composed of particles of matteni

revealed in the geological portions of this work; for they are now applied as a means
by which my present revealments may be elucidated and. demonstrated as true. I
will also institute illustrations and comparisons of a very familiar nature, in order
that the main principles to be presented may be easily conceived and comprehended.
It will be seen, also, that the following sustains a close relation ta the scientific parts
of this work; and they will mutually explain and, confirm each other. I would,.
therefore, have the reader's memory duly impressed. with the previous-philosophical
investigations, so that he may perceive the connexion,.aar readily apprehend the.
things now to follow.

in their rudimental forms.  These are angular, amorpho-angular, and
Inulti-angular.  These forms, when associated, compose the various
mineral bodies in the earth. The first of these particles are the most
perfectly angular; the ascending forms are the arnorpho-angular, and
the perfect forms among these are the multi-angular. The first is the
parent and measure of the second, and this again is the beginning of
the third, which completes a trinity and also pervades the lower
forms.  Thus the second and third forms are each higher degrees
of development from the first. The highest proceed from the lowest,
and, when developed, pervade and comprehend the whole body,
which thus forms a mineral compound.
Then, again, Series are established by the successive unfoldings of
forms.  These series are strata of associated particles, such as are
exemplified in the strata of the earth, and of various bodies which possess successive coatings, all of which are necessary to form one body,
substance, or compound.  These series are three; and these characterize the various compounds in the mineral kingdom.
Then, again, Series develop Degrees.  These are the successive
states of purity of particles, and of their approach to perfection, both.in form, series, and association.  The highest degree in the mineral.kingdom approaches, and inseparably flows into, the vegetable king-.dom.  For the highest degree of mineral substance exemplifies both
she lower particles of its own nature, and the first particles of the
successive compound, which is the vegetable creation. The highest
form, also, in the mineral, which is the multi-angular, flows directly
iinto, and becomes the origin, parent, and measure of the first forms
in, the vegetable kingdom.  So also do the highest Series flow into
the vegetable formation, through the degrees of association determined by the ascending forms, the sequence of series, and the.unfolding  of the same.
So the forms in the mineral world- are of three degrees of devel-.opment. Thus they form one compound —which develops series,.associations, and degrees, all of which are necessary to establish the
various mineral bodies, to designate their degree of refinement, and
to determine with what order of particles or elements they are capable of being assimilated.  The forms, series, and degrees in the
mineral world, are thus developed in the most perfect harmony. The
highest of each in all cases pervade the lower; and at the same time
they become the parent and measure of the rudimental productions
in the vegetable world.





## p. 595 (#623) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  595
In the vegetable compounds there exist circular forms-which
are the unfolded forms of the perfected angular.  Then the rudimental circular develops diameters, and ascending circulars which
very slightly approach the spiral.  Thus three different forms are
also discoverable in the vegetable world: that is, the perfected angular (or multi-angular); the first circular, which develops diameters;
and both of these ascend toward, and very slightly represent, the
spiral forms, which flow  directly into the animal world.  In the
vegetable creation also are the three Series, or the three degrees of
perfection in forms.  These Series also represent the Degrees that
are unfolded by the ascending series of forms that flow from the
parent or measure consisting of the lower forms.  Meanwhile, they
make a perfect compound, the whole of which forms the Vegetable
Creation.
The highest form, which is the ascending circular, becomes the
connecting form between the vegetable and animal; and in the latter
it becomes the perfect spiral.  Also the highest Degrees of vegetable
compounds become the first degrees of animal organization. And
each series and association of forms, in like manner progressively
ascends to the first series and degrees of the animal forms; and all
pass into, and become the germ, parent, measure, and substance of,
the whole Animal World.  The first forms discovered in the animal
are the spiral or progressive particles which develop the reciprocal
motions of the whole filame.  The second fortns are the unfolded
spiral, which are the spiritual forms or active particles that become
the receptacles of all progressive movement.  The highest fornis in
the animal creationri are the perfected spiritual-  which join the animal compound to the material organization of Man.
Here, then, the spiritual forms introduce the particles to compose
the organization of Mlan-which, when perfected, develops the
highest or celestial forms in matter.  Thus the perfect spliritual become the first celestial forms, the perfection of which establishes the
human organization.  What I mean by celestial forms are those particles of matter that contain in themselves perfected every species of
form in the subordinate kingdoms, and meanwhile become the receptacles of all degrees of spiritual life, which are not only contained in,
but are developed by them, in such a perfect and corresponding
manner that all the lower forms in the animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds, are by them governed, mirrored, and vividly represented.





## p. 596 (#624) ############################################


696            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Then, again, the highest series or strata of forms in the animal
world, flow directly into the rudimental forms of mankind. These
establish the various series, strata, or associations, of the human fam-;ly. AlsQ the highest degree in the animal, by which I mean the
most perfect structure, not only typifies, but becomes the parent,
measure, and germ, of the Human World.
~ 172. Thus in Man are these lower forms fully developed and
perfected: for in him are the spiritual, the perfect spiritual, and the
celestial forms of the particles of matter.  The celestial are the highest and most minute particles in the human organization-such as
exist in the lower kingdoms only in an imperfect and undeveloped
state.
Man also possesses the three degrees of the ascended forms.
These degrees establish and preserve the individuality of every Form
in the human world; while at the same time every Form develops
in perfect harmony, series, degrees, associations, and representations,
which are in every particular in the most perfect unity, harmony, and
mutual dependence upon each other.
It will be seen by this that the angular particles of matter develop
the circular —which in their turn unfold rectilinear planes, diameters, axes, and poles-all of which are imperfectly discovered in
the Vegetable World.
Then, again, the progressive circular forms unfold and become
the spiral, which is a more important stage in the process of progressive development.  The spiral contains the circular and all its properties; and all these are discoverable in the Animal World. Thien,
again, the successive spiral forms unfold the spiritual-which latter,
in llke manner, unfold the celestial or perfect forms of rudimental
matter.  Thus the angular develops the circular, this the spiral,
this the spiritual, and this the celestial-all of which are contained
in the perfect Forms of the Human World.
From this it is seen that the angular is the parent of all higher
forms, and contains them all undeveloped: while the higihest when
developed pervades all the lower forms, and unites them as one perfect Whole.  Therefore the celestial forms of matter which compose
the human organization are the flower of the germinal form, or seed,
which is the angular. For the seed of all material compounds is
involved in the lowest stage of matter, which germinates and produces the Mineral World.  This, again, adds to the body of the





## p. 597 (#625) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                597
great Tree of Creation, whose next stage of development is in the
form of the Vegetable World.  The next expansion of the body of
this great Tree develops the Animal World.  It now puts forth
-)ranches, which bud, and the flower is the Human World. Thus it
is that the material Tree of Causation has successively yielded new
forms, which correspond in every general feature to germ, body,
branches, buds, and blossoms.
It is made evident from  these considerations, that matter is the
same in every department of the Universe —but that it forms dissimilar organizations only as it, in various degrees of development,
becomes differently combined.  I find, then, that all things are constituted of the same materials, but that these are combined in different forms and proportions.  Thus are developed successively, uniformly, and progressively,Forms, Series, and Degrees; and these are
all necessary in order that each compound and each animated organization may perform the office of an organ to transfer that which
is below it to a higher degree of material association.  It is by this
diversity of forms that the various Degrees of creation are rendered
perfect, reciprocal, and harmonious.
The dissimilar combinations of matter, then, are the designed
means by which all the various forms may, in series and degrees, be
progressively developed. And the moment such development is
completed, a combined Form of the same, capable of preserving its
identity, is at once established, as is also its absolute dependence
upon the lower forms for its existence.
Thus Man is the highest and most perfect combination of organized matter.  He therefore exercises an unlimited proprietorship
over all below his exalted position, and is the governor, director, and
lord of all subordinate creations. He in this sense pervades all below him. At the same time he is dependent upon the perfect fulfilment of every office which is sustained by the subordinate kingdoms;
and without them  and their perpetual contributions, he could not
possibly exist. Man, then, is not only the highest form, but comprehends likewise the lowest; and without the lowest, the highest could
not be. He therefore should practically acknowledge his dependence
accordingly; and in properly doing this, he would so perfect his
wisdom as that he might be truly the director, governor, and lord of
all things.
The mineral, vegetable, and animal compounds, all enter into
the composition of the human form —though these are essentially





## p. 598 (#626) ############################################


59S            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
modified in tne process, according to the law of progression. And
man is thus a representative of all subordinate forms; for in him
their properties and essential principles exist, but are developed and
modified in a manner dissimilar to their original state.  He is, therefore a perfect microcosm —and is the perfection of all material compounds.
The mineral formation is to the great Form or structure of Nature,
what the bone is to the human organization-a basis or fr-ame upon
which the superstructure may rest and be perfected.  The forms in
the vegetable kingdom are to Nature, what the absorbing vessels are to
the human body; that is, receptacles for the influx, and organs for
the reflux, of circulating and ascending particles.  The forms in the
animal kingdom are to Nature, what the visceral system is to the
human body; that is, organs by and through which rudimental particles may be secreted, decomposed, recombined, and sublimated:and they are thus necessary parts to perform the various functions of
one harmonious Structure.  Man is to Nature, what the head is to
man; that is, a throne from which proceeds wisdom, power, direction, government, and distributive justice, to all the lower, useful, and
subordinate departments of the same perfect Whole.
~ 173. It is seen from these considerations, that a trinity consisting of three degrees of forms, is existing in one substance, the same
being necessary to constitute such substance a perfect creation. Let
it be duly impressed, that every form in the mineral, vegetable, and
animal world, is determined and established by the peculiar forms of
the atoms or particles of matter which enter into and compose such.
It is to this speciflcness of atomic forms that the mineral, vegetable,
animal, and human worlds, owe their respective existences.  For if
particles of matter did not become in form essentially modified, by
uniform ascension through successive series and degrees of developnment, these various worlds of creation could not possibly be unfolded.
Let this, then, be the standard formula exhibiting the relative degrees
of perfection in matter, in order that the mind may conceive of the
relation that exists between the lowest and the highest developments
of Nature. And by knowing this much, the first principles involved
in the material creation of Man, are clearly impressed upon the understanding; and from this the mind will be led to higher and corresponding degrees of the same species of knowledge.
A trinity exists in -every substance, and in every possible manner,

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 599
ooth as to forms, series, and degrees, and their relations to subsequent creations. First, in the mineral world there exist interior, mediatorial, and exterior forms: that is, the lower, transition, and perfected bodies or particles of matter.   The lowest contains the
highest; and until the highest is developed, a mineral compound is
not formed.  But when the highest is perfectly unfolded, it forms
the seal and crown, and is the governing property which forms of the
whole a perfect composition.
Then there are Series, and these are three in number.  The first
series comprehends the lower angular forms, until they progressively
change and flow into the transition or mediatorial forms.  Then the
second series in like manner comprehends these intermediate forms,
until they flow into the highest or multi-angulars.  The third series
comprehends these higher forms, and also pervades and acts on the
lower forms, and unites the whole as one compound. Then in like
manner do the lower forms and lower series form one degree, or decided part-which also explains the second degree, which comprehends the second form and second series. And the third degree,
which is the highest of the mineral kingdom, includes the third form
and third series.  The degrees in every department of Nature determine the states of perfection which are exemplified in exterior and
manifest forms.  By presenting the descriptions in this form, the
mind is enabled to perceive the rationnale of the whole subject.  As
it is in the Mineral World, so it is in every possible particular with
the Vegetable and Animal Worlds.
To render the subject still more familiar, I will explain it differently.  The interior or first form  is the soul or moving principle of
the compound, containing in itself all the forms and properties displayed in the higher degrees of the same substance.  The mediatorial form is a connecting link between the soul and the exterior form,
which is the perfected body.  Thus the exterior is the perfectly manifest form, displaying minutely the qualities that were contained undeveloped in the first or rudimental forms, which now are known to
be the creator of the external.  Thus a Ipcfcct Wh/ole is formed,
composed of Soul and Body.
When ascending to the vegetable world, we find the same forms,
series, and degrees, unfolded and manifested in a most perfectlycorresponding manner. And again, were it not for a change in the
forms of the particles of matter, the vegetable creation could not be,

600             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
because it would not have had a uniformly-actuating creator, such as
is the mineral world with its present laws.
In ascending to the animal kingdom, we find new external forms
presenting similar varieties to those in the mineral kingdom.  And
in the animal are not only manifested new forms, but new series and
degrees.  Again: the aninial world could not have existed had not
the vegetable world ascended to such a degree of perfection as to
become the creator and measure of a higher development.
Thus it is that the mineral kingdom when perfected becomes the
soul, measure, and creator, of the vegetable; and this latter, when
perfected, becomes the parent, soul, and creator, of the animal.  So
likewise does the animal become the soul, measure, and creator, of
the human organization.
It is now made clear that the form, size, and symmetry, of the
specific creations of each kingdom, including Man, are determined
only by the perfection of prior creations on which they are dependent.  And it is from the lower, inferior, gross, and unseemly forms,
that the human organization has been established, with all its beauty,
symmetry, and perfection of constitution.  I desire to call special
attention to this fact, as it shows that the mind can only know of
perfection by viewing forms, series of forms, and degrees of these,
comparatively-these pervading alike the lower and higher departments of animated Nature.
Thus we have an irresistible demonstration that the lowest form is
the interior or soul, parent, and measure, of all higher forms, even to
the perfect and symmetrical organization of Man; and that ihe is the
grand effect or ultimate design of Nature.  This is manifest fiom the
fact that all forms flow progressively into, and are comprehended by,
the human-organization.  This makes man the flower of' creation.
possessing all the essences, properties, and characteristics, of the
lower creations, while these at the same time contribute to hlis necessities, and he insensibly performs a similar office toward therm.
Again: the angular forms correspond to the mineral; the circular
forms correspond to the vegetable; the spiral forms correspond to
and represent the animnal world; and the spiritual and celestial forms
typify and correspond to the human world-while it in return, typifies, represents, and corresponds to, every subordinate form in this
whole rudimental sphere of successive developments.
Again: the mineral world is the interior, the vegetable world is
the mediatorial, and the animal world is the perfect Body, of the

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                0G
whole system of creation.  That is, the mineral is the soul or creator
from which flows spontaneously the transition link, which is the vegetable; and this flows onward to the completion of the perfect Body,
which is the whole animal kingdom.
Thus it is made manifest that the three degrees of creation (which
are the Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal) flow into, and as it were
spontaneously unfold, the whole human creation; and that the three
are necessary in order to unfold a complete and symmetrical organization. And this is the great Head, Flower, and lord of creation,
and is called MAN.
~ 174. A Trinity is nowv unfolded in every department of Nature:
for it is discovered in the form  of particles, in the series or associations of these, and in the degree of each form and series; and all may
be discovered in any established, organized substance.  This truth
is also exemplified in the three great worlds of formation, viz., the
mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. For these, when generally
comprehended, form a perfect Trinity; and all are engaged in the
development of Man.
It is, however, proper to introduce a few more illustrations.  The
first of these is to be found in the Key, and is established in the subsequent scientific considerations: and that is, " The inlterior is the
real reality, and the productive cause of all external effects."  And
here this proposition is demonstrated even beyond the possibility of
a doubt or refutation.  For now we discover that the interior and
real cause of the mineral, vegetable, and animal creations, is found
only in the rudimental forms or first particles in each specific degree
of formation and development.  Hence it is impossible to discover
the causes of visible effects iq as visible a manner as the effects themselves are manifested.  But in order to understand the nature and
cause of effects, the substance constituting the effect must be analyzed, and its actuating principle discovered.  In no other way can
there be any absolute knowledge obtained concerning the nature and
cause of any of the effects niade manifest to the natural senses in the
outer world.
The bones in the human system correspond in their functions to
the mineral structure.  The secreting and absorbing vessels of the
human body correspond to, and perform a similar office with, the
vegetable structure.  The viscera or internal organs of the human
body perform an office analogous to that of the animal structure in

602             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the outer world, in relation to the great System of divine organizations.  The head, or seat of goyernment belonging to the human
system, corresponds in the office it performs, to the human creation
in its connexion with the whole Body of animated Nature. In other
words, the mineral, vegetable, and animal degrees of creation, compose one perfect human Form.  For they are situated harmoniously
one with reference to another, and so connectedly that they perform
all the functions, possess all the parts, display all the distributive justice and harmony, develop all the reciprocal motions, exemplify all
the symmetry of, and finally absolutely represent and correspond to,
the human organization.  There is more sublimity in this viewx of the
great actuating, governing, and productive forms in Nature, than can
be possibly perceived in any superficial system that now prevails in
the world.
I have proved that man possesses a form so beautful in symmetry
and perfect in constitution merely because all subordinate forms of
particles of matter have progressively ascended to, and finally developed, the form of the human being. And I have proved also that
series or associations of forms likewise spontaneously unfold all the
innumerable parts displayed in the constitution of Man; and likewise
that degrees of forms, or of perfection in substances, have in a corresponding manner created and developed lMan.  Then in view of
all this, I repeat the question, " What is man materially?" — and I
affirm the answer, that " he is the perfection. of matter, the flower of
creation, and the lord over all animated things."
From  the unvarying teachings of these truths, it is proved that
Man is a united Whole-a congregation of perfected forms that
exist in the material world.  By this I mean, that all the lower and
inferior forms of the particles of matter have, by progressive degrees
of ascension, passed into the human organization.  And, as has
been stated, the most perfect forms in the atomic universe are the
celestial.   These are the last forms of rudimental matter-because another change would immerse them into another sphere of
material existence and composition.  For a proof of these things, 1
would request the reflecting mind to reconsider the interior and external forms that now exist upon the earth, the highest of which is Man.
It is seen from this, that if matter in a rudimental state proceeded
any higher than the celestial forms, which constitute the human form,
new forms would inevitably be developed, even above man, and would
be existing as organized beings.  But as there are no organized be




## p. 603 (#631) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                     603
ings higher than man in the rudimental state, this amounts to no less
than a demonstration that there are no higher forms than the celestial,
in the rudimental world.*  And as composed of them, man stands as
a representative, correspondent, and governor of all material things.
This much is, then, established —That Man is the perfection of
all forms, and degrees of these: and that they all have ascended in
a uniform and progressive manner, to the human form, which is the
grand result of all the subordinate creations.
Again: the mineral world is like a stomach, whose office it is to
receive, digest, and transfer particles firom the still more imperfect
substances of the earth.  Tile mineral kingdom, then, as soon as
established, commenced its work  of unceasing activity.  It is a
receptacle for the influi of particles still inferior, and is an agent to
modify and transfer thein, by a process of refluxation, into the form
of the first particles capable of associating with the vegetable world.
This, in its turn, performs the same office, receiving particles into its
composition, modifying them by its own qualities and properties, and
transferring them to the animal world. This in like manner, digests,
recombines, and prepares substances to enter into the human
world.  Then this world comprehends all the lower departments of
creation, and is a receptacle for the influx of the essences and
properties of all subordinate organizations.  It is likewise  a microcosm of the whole united energies and creations of Nature. MIeanwhile, it stands as an indestructible representative of the original
intention of the Divine Mind, by which unchangeable laws were
instituted to govern materials, with a view to the production of this
end.  Thus Law and Matter have accomplished the first end for
which they were inseparably created.
Further: the various kingdoms and forms in this rudimental
sphere, are all organs for the purpose of transferring, advancing, perfecting, and sublimating all particles in the lower forms of matter, so
that they may all conjoin in harmony, and produce Man.  Still further: the subordinate kingdoms are forms indispensable for the purpose of communicating a proper energy and quality to each particle
of matter, in order to render it suitable to associate and assimilate
with the human form.  All particles must be modified, recomposed,
* I am directed to say, that the terms " angular," ~" circular," " spiral," &c., are
employed comparatively, owing to the imperfection of language; and that for dis.
tinction, the same classifications might be made of the various forms above those
belonging to the rudimental world.

and brought to a proper degree of perfection, or else the human form
could not receive nourishment from, and be sustained by, the lower
forms in Nature.  This, again, is proof that man is a perfection of
matter in all its forms and degrees of sublimation, and that he is the
great Flower of the living Germ of this rudimental sphere, and is a
centre to and from which flow spontaneously favors, from and to all
the lower forms.
Herein are displayed the order, harmony, and perfection of the
movements of Nature, even to such a degree of beauty and grandeur
as the human mind is incapable of comprehending by exterior sight.
But man can do this when the more interior qualities of his mind are
opened.  Thus it is again proved, that man is a perfect organization
of all the atomic fornls in Nature and the Universe.*
~ 175. It is now made distinctly clear, that Man materially is the
lord and governor of animated Nature. And this being clearly established, the all-important and as yet undecided question next comes
up, What is man spiritually?
I answer: He is the Jelfectionl e(f Motion, or of the first great moving Principle of the Universe.  In other words, iHe is the WVisdom
of Love.
I have hitherto considered Nature and her forms and developments, only in a physical point of view, and have not associated
with them the moving or living Soul that actuates each particle in all
its progressive movements toward perfection.  But now we come
directly to a consideration of those life-giving principles that are the
souls of every form in being.
We begin, then, at the germ of all life, or the rudiments of INotion.  Motion flows into every particle of primeval matter, creates an
incessant activity, generates new qualities, tendencies, and spheres of
association, and finally enters into, and becomes the living Soul of
the whole Mineral World.
Motion primarily was in form, angular; that is, it displayed
eccentric variations, passing from one extreme to another in an impulsive and unorganized manner. Its irregularities were very inconsistent with a uniform order, but still it displayed all the active properties that could then by any possible means be developed. Motion had
not suitable forms to unfold more perfect living principles: neither

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                60b
had the forms of matter motion to give them new characters and new
tendencies to refinement.
The second form of Motion was similar to the angular forms in
matter which have been termed mediatorial.  Motion likewise ascended to the multi-angular; and this constituted Motion the perfect
Soul of the mineral kingdom.
Motion, like the particles of matter, has series of forms, and degrees of forms and series — all of which are displayed in the atomic
constitution of substances.  After Motion had thus ascended to one
perfect degree, it began to unfold new powers, forces, tendencies,
and actuating laws.  That is, it unfolded the circular motionwhich passed through all the degrees of this form until it became the
perfect circular-during which time it developed diameters, axes,
poles, rectilinear movements, and centripetal and centrifugal forces.
Having all these attributes, Motion, in the three united degrees of this
form, became a new principle, which was Life: and this is the Soul
of the Vegetable World.
Life, therefore, is a development of Motion. This life, which is
now exemplified in the vegetable creation, proceeded from the circular into the spiral form.  And after it had ascended through all the
modifications of this form, it developed a new tendency-a new
principle-and one which was differently manifested.  This was
Sensation; and this is the Soul of the Animal World.
It is thus made clear that Motion was only organized as such after
it had fully developed the properties of the Mineral Kingdom; and
then it became the abiding soul and actuating principle of this kingdom.  So likewise Motion passed'through the successive stages of
the circular form; and until it became perfected in this peculiar form,
it could not have developed that essential principle which became
the Soul of the Vegetable Creation. So likewise did Life, thus established, ascend through all of its subsequent forms, which were the
spiral, and unfold that new principle of life and energy, which is
Sensation, and which became the Soul and moving principle of the
Animal World. And it is made also clear that Motion, Life, and
Sensation, which form one, as included in the latter, progressed to
the spiritual, and through this into the perfect spiritual, which is the
celestial form.  Sensation, becoming thus perfected, constitutes the
Soul of Man, which is Intelligence.
Thus Motion contained in germ all the essential parts and forms,
which, when ascended and perfected, constitute the Soul of the Hu

606            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
inan World, which is the Wisdom and Intelligence of this whole
rudimental system  of creations.  Thus Motion is the Soul of the
Mineral World, Life is the Soul of the Vegetable World, Sensation
is the Soul of the Animal World, and Intelligence is the Soul of the
Human World.
~ 176. It would be well for the reader to keep in memory the remarks concerning the external forms of matter, in order that he may
recognise the relation that exists between the moving principles of
each form, and understand how they determine and confirm one another's individual existence. It has been shown that Motion is only
established as such, in an order which is indestructible, after it has
passed through all the innumerable forms in the angular developments
of matter.  For when Motion and Matter ascend alike to a degree
that confirms their organized existence, and can not ascend any higher
without changing completely their mode of existence and order of
form-it is then that Matter and Motion become perfectly and indestructibly organized, never to change their rudimental structure and
power of external development.  Let it be deeply impressed that
Motion becomes a perfectly-organized and individualized principle,
when Matter has assumed a form of existence from which it is never
known to change: and this is fully exemplified in the Mineral World.
Then it is that Motion becomes the undying Soul of this mineral
structure.  Though continually changing the elements of its being,
it never changes in its essential constitution.
So when Life has become similarly established, it has likewise
become an indestructible organization. And Life is developed only
as the particles of matter correspondingly ascend to, and fully develop, the vegetable structure.  Then it is that Life is established as
Life, for ever.  It undergoes no constitutional change, but preserves
its identity throughout all time.
And Sensation is only known as such after Life has ascended
through all the successive forms in the animal world to the highest
of them; and when this is accomplished, Sensation becomes also an
unvarying and unchangeable principle.  It assumes an identity which
it for ever preserves. And then Sensation becomes the immortal
Soul of the animal structure.
Intelligence, in like manner, becomes such only after Sensation
has ascended through all the forms in the Human World to the highest type and most perfect organization; and then it becomes an or




## p. 607 (#635) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  607
ganized and immortal principle. It assumes an identity which can
not be destroyed, and it continues thus for ever.  Then it is that
Intelligence becomes the unchangeable Soul of the Human structure.
After Motion has ascended to Intelligence, Intelligence comprehends all the subordinate degrees of the same living principle.  It
pervades alike all the interior moving principles that actuate all forms
of matter in their various degrees of activity, force, refinement, and
animation.  Intelligence, therefore, is the perfection of the principle
of Motion: and this answers the question,' What is man spPritually?"
Motion is the Germ, Life the Body, Sensation the Branches, and
Intelligence the Flower.  Or, Motion is the parent and soul of Life;
Life is the parent, measure, and creator, of Sensation'; and Sensation
is the parent and creator of Intelligence.  Thus each one becomes
the creator of another.  In other words, from  the interior possessions of Motion is unfolded Life; and from its interior properties is
unfolded Sensation; and out of its inconceivable attributes flows
spontaneously the perfection of all the rest, which is Intelligence.
Again: Motion corresponds to the Mineral; Life corresponds to
the Vegetable; Sensation corresponds to the Animal; and Intelligence, corresponds to the Human World. Once more: the rudiments of Motion, which are eccentric movements, are the intcrior;
the transition or more uniform  movements are the mediatorial; and
the exterior or perfect movement is the Form or Body. This completes the organization; and this constitutes of the whole a principle
of undying Motion.  The rudimental circular is the interior; the
transition is the mediatorial or ascending movement; and the exterior is the Body, which confirms of Motion a principle of undying
Life.  So are the interior, mediatorial, and exterior movements, discovered in the organized form of Sensation; and likewise are they
discoverable in that individualized principle of man which is termed
Intelligence.
To speak in more general terms, the spirit of man is constructed
as follows: The interior or Soul is Motion; the transition or mediatorial is Life; the exterior is the perfect Body, which is Sensation;
the elements of the whole of these combined, constitute the spiritual
form of man, which is Intelligence. And as the subordinate developments of these principles are not known to change in the least
possible particular, this is conclusive evidence that the highest of

608            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
them all, which is the spiritual form of Man, can not possibly change
its essential constitution, or lose its absolute identity.
~ 177. The all-important truth to be established in the mind is,
that the interior essence is the soul and creator of all external forms,
which forms determine and demonstrate the mode of such soul's existence.  The form which every particle of matter assumes, is that
created and determined by the peculiar essence which is latent in
the particle itself.  A knowledge of this truth conveys to the mind a
perfect conception of the interior, creative Cause of all things, and
its attributes as displayed and developed in its external form.  Motion being the first all-pervading principle, as derived from the Great
Positive Mind, becomes the creator of all rudimental and elementary
substances.  Therefore Motion is the principle which gives to the
mineral compounds their peculiar form, texture, and mode of existence.
Motion thus develops material forms, which are merely the effect
of the essence, and its use in relation to higher degrees-of its own
constitution.  Forms, then, are the mode by which Motion in the
lowest degrees of Nature comes in contact, and forms a relation withl
the higher degrees of external development.  In like manner Life is
the essence, soul, and creator, of the whole vegetable formation; and
this displays the use of Life, and manifests its relation to the lower
and higher degrees of organic structure.  So Sensation is the soul,
essence, and creator, of the Animal World; and in, by, and through
this, all the qualities and essential attributes of its interior are made
manifest to the outer world.  Moroever, it here establishes a relation
to the lower and the higher structures of the same combinations of
matter. So Motion, Life, and Sensation, as three, flow into, and
become one established essence and creator, of and by which the
human organization is developed and perfected.  And the highest attribute of this form is Intelligence; and this was contained in,
and is unfolded from, the germinal properties that exist in the peculiar
essence from which the whole human structure is developed as a perfect Form.  Thus all things are unfolded to the outer world by the
incessant activity of the qualities, attributes, and unchangeable tendencies of the internal essence or soul, which is the interior or life
of all external and material existences.
I perceive that metaphysicians and theologians have confined their
attention to, and based their theories upon, the superficial manifesta




## p. 609 (#637) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 609
tions of the human mind; and thereby they have unavoidably misconceived the true relation which exists between the interior or
prompting cause, and the form through, by, and upon which, the
effects of the human mind become visible.  They have in almost
every instance confounded the effect and cause, and have as often
misconceived the real cause, upon a knowledge of which must rest
the soundness of all metaphysical and psychological theories.  No
one among such investigators has been able to demonstrate the existence of the soul or essence of the human form as disconnected fiom
the form itself.  All philosophy that directs the attention to the external only, takes from the human mind those evidences that are necessary to direct the enlightened perception to a more interior understanding of the real essence, which unfolds itself to the outer world,
in the shape of the human structure.
Motion, being the soul of the Mineral World, becomes, as has
been related, an established an unchangeable principle as confined
in a specific manner to that mode of external existence.  By this I.
would be understood to mean that the whole mineral creation is the
external mode and form by which Motion exists, and is manifested to
the outer world.  Motion being the creative principle, unfolds the
essence in a material Body, which Body is composed of innumerable
and dissimilar combinations of atoms, all of which enter into the
whole constitution xfith inconceivable varieties of affinities or affections, one particle for another.  Meanwhile it renders the whole
structure suitable to develop, and communicate its interior possessions to, as many analogous forms in the higher plane of creation,
It is well to keep in mind that I amn speaking of the wihole mineral
world as one Body, whose soul is Motion, or that incessant and invisible principle whose attributes are only known by effects perceptible in the physical constitution of Nature.  The first unfolded attribute of Motion is discoverable in the first dlegree of mineral forms.
Then, in like manner, L/fe is an essence that unfolds to the outer
world its inner possessions; and this unfolding is the whole Vegetable Creation-the whole being as one perfect Fortm.  Understand,.
then, that all knowledge which can be obtained of the interior quali,ties of Life, is only to be derived from its outward mode of exist->
ence.  For as Life is the soul and creator of the whole vegetable
Form, so this Form becomes the mode of the material existence of
Life. The innumerable varieties of form that constitute the vegeta —
hle kingdom are only the s4lccessive degreos of modified (dleve!op;

610            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
ment-each form at the same time being elaborated as an outward
existence by the interior energies and promptings of the essence of
Life. This whole vegetable world, as a perfect form, is, then, a
material mode of the existence of Life; for by this mode of material
development, Life can communicate its unfolded possessions to higher
degrees of matter, which become the receptacles of, and at once determine, a new mode of existence, for a new element of life, which
is Sensation..
Keeping in mind, then, the uniform  developments from the inner
to the outer world, a knowledge is received concerning the corresponding development of the animal world.  For as by understanding one particle of matter, with all its properties, tendencies, and capabilities, a corresponding knowledge is obtained concerning the
structure of the whole Universe-so by understanding the mode of
the existence of Life, an understanding is at once established concerniing the higher degrees and similar modes of existence, as determined,by their Soul or essence.  And as by knowing the measurement of one
inch, a rule is obtained by which may be measured the length and
breadth of all material existence- so it is equally plain that if the
existence of Life and Sensation is understood, the same laws and
principles which govern these will introduce the mind into higher,degrees and planes of corresponding exterior development.
The mode by which Sensation exists in its relation to the outer
world, consists only in the structure of the whole animal creation.'The mode by which Motion, Life, and Sensation, exist as one united
essence and Soul in its relation to the material world, consists only
in the perfect stricture of the human organization.  Then it is not
the body, the form, the material, that develops and organizes the
spiritual principles: for if this were true, then indeed the human
1mind could not sustain its identity as disconnected from the instrument by which it was developed. This would likewise be unfailingly true of all material organizations and their living principles.
~ 178. The mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds, bodies, or
forms of existence, each have as their essence, a general, living Soul,
which unitedly appertains to the whole Body, and only exists in the
outer world as the Body is unfolded.  Hence when I say that Mo-?tion became an organized Soul, or an unchangeable principle, I have
reference to its connexion with the whole Body or Form of the min-:fral world. So also with the vegetable and animal worlds. Not

that each individual formn in the vegetable and animal structure has
a distinct, organized, and immortal soul, but that the whole of each
kingdom, as a Body, has for its Soul the prompting essence, the
one of Life, and the other of Sensation.
But the human world constitutes a degree of material existence ex
ceedingly superior to the lower forms which each general living sou
has developed.  And it is in the human world that Motion, Life,
and Sensation, become united and perfected as one living, organized
essence-an individuclized Soul, by and from  which every human
form is created. Each individual human structure also possesses an organized soul, composed of the subordinate attributes existing in the
lower planes of material forms.  Therefore this essence unfolds and
displays its interior qualities in the human form, which is Man. Thus
the exterior formn of man is the perfect representative of the peculiar
constitution and qualities of his spiritual essence or soul.  In other
words, it is an exact correspondent of all the tendencies, attributes,
qualities, and possessions of his interior soul, essence, and creator.
The truth of this principle is manifested in every department of
the material Universe, and especially in the various departments of
material life. The mnincral Body or world, displays the perfect complexion of its prompting essence.  The vegetable displays, corresponds to, and represents, the character and quality of its Soul,
which is Like.  So with the whole animal Form; and so it is with
Man.  The interior or inner essence, in every instance, and without
variation, is the soul, substance, creator, and cause, of all c'jccts,
which are the forms visible in the outer world.  The external evi
dence of this truth consists in the appearances of all external forms;
in the relations which they sustain to one another; in their invariable manifestations and developments, and in that general relation
which they all sustain to the great structure of the material Universe.
The evidences of Motion are in the mineral compounds of the
earth; for by and through them, Motion is represented  and made
manifest to the outer world.  Yet Motion is not an organized Principle in every individual compound; for the indiriduals are ilnperfect in their structure, and mode of existence.  But Motion is a'iving principle and actuating cause to the whole plane of mineral
creation, because the whole united forms a perfect Body —though an
imperfect one in its relation to higher combinations of matter.  The
evidence of Lfe is in the external structure of the vegetable world:
yet Life is not a perfected and organized soul in individual forms





## p. 612 (#640) ############################################


612            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
composing the great Form, because these invariably display imperfection.  But when considering the whole structure of the vegetable
creation, we have displayed one perfect Formn, which is the evidence
that Life is the cause and actuating principle; and of this, the whole
is a perfect external representation.  The evidence of Sensation is
confined to, and discoverable only in, the vast Form of animal existence.  Yet an individualized existence of this principle is not established by the perfectness of any isolated organization; for all such
display the most eccentric and irregular forms, inclinations, and habits.  Butt when observing the whole animal world, as united, we
behold a perfect Form - which is an evidence of the perfect structure
of the principle of Sensation: for by it the external is developed.
But when we ascend to the Htuman World, the evidence which
conveys to the mind a corresponding though indefinite perception
concerning the interior and creative essence, is essentially changed:
because every individual human form, is of itself a perfect organization, not in the least particular transcended by any other forms-but
instead thereof, consists of a combination of all the lower and subordinate material forms and structures in Nature. And as each human
form is thus a congregation of all subordinate ones, so each becomes
a perfect organization of the material Universe, a receptacle of the
lower degrees of matter, and a microcosim in which the Universe is
seen in miniature.  Thus the human form is a perfect representation
of all material existences.  And it is a reflection, fulfilment, and
demonstration of the ultimate design of the Divine Mind, which was
conceived and established in the depths of that inconceivable Vortex
fiorm which incessantly flows an infinity of perfected things.
Here, then, is the sensutous evidence that the human form  is a
form determined by a corresponding creative essence, which is man's
organized and immortal soul. Not only in viewing the whole Human
World as one Form, is Intelligence discovered as an interior quality
and essence, but in every individual structure are all the required
qualities to demonstrate an absolute individualization of the interior,
creative essence.  The whole Human Form  or World, is of itself
the perfect creation of Nature.  This can not be said of the subordinate kingdoms.  Moreover, a single human form is a pclfect organization, representative, and reflection, of all the lower compounds in
Nature.  And thus man is the perfect flower, being progressively
developed from all the lower parts of the same great Tree of ceaseless causation. Herein, then, lies the external evidence that man





## p. 613 (#641) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 613
possesses an actuating and organized essence which no other fortr,
possesses. And this will continue to retain its individuality, because.t is the perfect form and 2perfect soul of all the lower degrees of Motion, Life, and Sensation, these being only the elements of the germ
which, when perfected, flow into and form  one perfect and indestructible Whole, which is the soul or spiritual essence of man.
~ 179. As has been stated, if the human form were the instrument
by and through which the mind is created, then it would be impossible for the mind to exist as disconnected from the form which produced it.  The opinion that the mind is thus produced, has for a
long time prevailed in the world, because sensuous observation has been
made the basis of metaphysical speculation.  But those who have
believed thus have been misimpressed; and it is owing to such a
conviction that too little belief has been entertained concerning the
spiritual identity of man when the form is no more. Such impressions have resulted from deep investigation, but from that investigation which is confined to the superficial evidences of the laws of
Nature and of Man.  Another class has, by a superficial interpretation of theological writings, believed more strongly in the identity
of the spirit of man, after the body is by it rejected, than their premises have warranted.  All this is consequent of the uninstructed
state of the mind, and of the direction of its faculties more in favor
of those things which are imaginary than of those which are real.
But instead of the body creating and developing the spirit, the
spirit is first organized, individualized, and potentialized.  From it
is unfolded the outer, or the organization.  The latter thus becomes
an instrument by and through which the interior principle or formn,
communicates with the material world.  Therefore, the body is only
a mode, a form, by and through which the spirit or essence displays
itself to the outer world.  Thus it is that the body is in constant
subordination.  While the spirit en-folds itself in a material form, it
likewise exerts the most absolute power over every portion of its
outward form, and is perpetually distributing motion, life, and sensation, throughout all the avenues and recesses of the same.
AMotion is the lowest and first attribute of the human soul.  This
has flown through all the kingdoms uniformly, up to and into the human formn; and there, as a subordinate element of the spirit, it performs all the corresponding motions that are displayed in the human
body.  Life is a highller element of the spirit, and in like manner

(14             NATURErS DIVINE REVELATIONS.
communicates to its outer form all the incessant and reciprocal mo-:ions to whinch every minute particle of the body is subjected, and in
which are mavuifested precision and perfection of action not discoverable in any other material constitution.  Sensation also flows spontaneously out of Life, as Life does out of Motion.  This is a still higher
element of the spirit.  It exists upon the external surfaces of the visceral and muscular systems, and pervades the serous surfaces of every
organ throughout the whole body; and it serves as the mediator to
connect the material form to material and foreign substances.  Likewise it serves as a lever upon which the spirit acts to produce its various manifestations to the outer world.  In other words, Sensation
being the highest of the subordinate elements of the spirit, becomes
the connecting link between the material and spiritual constitution.
For were it not for a conscious, pervading medium that penetrates
alike every particle of the human form, the spiritual organization
could not by any possible means sustain a connexion with a material
constitution, like the body of man.
Thus it is made manifest why Sensation is the highest Soul of the
subordinate kingdoms: for by sensation the spirit is connected with
the inanimate particles of matter, which constitute its body and its
external form.  Sensation is the universal medium  between spirit
and matter: and matter would display no motion, no life, no sensation, were it not for the indestructible and ascending elements of
which the individualized spirit of man is an ultimate result.
Thus Motion animates the Mineral World, in which it creates, determines, and manifests, its own material mode of existence.  So
Life is the creator and animator of the Vegetable, and Sensation is
the creator and animator of the Animal World: and all of these combined and perfected, develop Intelligence; and this, as the soul, the
essence, the creator, of Man, animates the whole Human World.
Here, then, is the demonstration that essence determines, and unfolds itself into, its material form; and this displays the use and end
for which the form is created.  And inasmuch as essence is the parent
and animator of material organizations, it therefore follows that each
body is an external representation of its interior essence and creating cause.  Man, then, in his material or outward form, is a perfect
representation of the essence, quality, and individual structure of tile
spirit within.  Thus the body is merely a coating, a garment, a
sheathing of the spiritual principle, whereby the latter is enabled to
communicate with all material things within its plane of existence,





## p. 615 (#643) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                  615
and meanwhile is the unchangeable type of the great End detei
mined upon by the Divine Mind.
So the spirit, or soul, or essence, which are here considered as
one, is not dependent upon the physical organization for its identity
and existence.  But the body is subordinate to the spirit, and is dependent for its motion, life, energies, animation, and even for its existence, upon the immortal spirit within, whose continuous identity is
determined by eternal law, according to which matter in all cases
stands only as its representative and external development.
~ 180. Form, then, is the only external mode by which all essences exist, and is the state which they assume in reference to all
material things.  The most delicate plant puts forth its tendrils,
fibres, and( finely-interwoven substances, only by virtue of the essence
which develops itself finom the inner to the outer world in that form.
And the rose, with all its beauty, delicacy, and fragrance, is a perfect
representative of the interior essence that developed it.  11 such
forms, however complicated and varied in appearance they may be,
manifest only the essential qualities of their own creative soul.  The
outer, in every instance, is a perfect type, image, and correspondent,
of the inner, from which it proceeded.  The most delicate a*nimal
form is also a representation of its interior, living essence and actuating principle: and the most gigantic animal form is only a higher
degree of development and a higher representative of corresponding
qualities which are its soul and creator.
Yet the whole animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds, are as one
Form to the body of Man; for they collectively only possess what the
human organization individually is composed of.  Thus it is that the
human form is the perfection of all forms. And as this is established, it is made equally clear that its soul or essence is a corresponding structure, of which the eterior is the manifest mode of
being, and the exact representative.
And it is necessary that it should be well understood and borne in
mind that form is not the creator of life, or of its attributes, but that
the form, in every department of Nature, is the exterior mode of every
living soul's existence.  But in neither of the lower kingdoms have
the forins an organized principle of interior life individually, but they
have collectively, as constituting one perfect plane of form and creation.  The human form has an organized principle individually, because every human organization is a congregation of all subordinate





## p. 616 (#644) ############################################


616             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
forms and substances in matter, and is likewise an indestructible representation of all. Thus the human body is a Universe, subsisting
and existing upon all lower forms of organic life, and is of itself a
whole creation, in and by which the labors of Nature, and the ultimate
design of the Great Eternal Cause, are typified and absolutely fulfilled.  And tile human form is of all this a clear and living demonstration.
The use of every organized substance is displayed in its external
relations to all inferior and superior constitutions of matter; and it
depends upon them for its existence and its capacity to fulfil the use
and accomplish tile end for which it was designed.  Forms of all
series and classifications contain in themselves evidences of their use
to the material world; and they also determine the specific degrees
of uniform and ceaseless progression.  A series of forms is merely a
congregation of organic beings of one type, fromn the lowest form
through the successive modifications, to the highest; all of which
compos~ one full and decided degree of organization.
The uses of all things to the outer world are discoverable only) in
the inseparable relations which they sustain to all things, and in the
offices which they are incessantly fulfilling.  Thus there is a use in
the mineral, vegetable, and animal creations; and their external modes
of existence demonstrate their offices, and also prove that thley are
indispensable developments for the purpose of unfolding and perfecting the human form.  Thlis latter is to all of them a seal, crown,
and throne of power; and it is a centre around which the willole creations of Nature revolve in their ascending progress.
Three distinct uses are discoverable in the forms in the outer
world.  Their first and subordinate use is to establish the mode in
and by which all essence may exist, and preserve its identity of unceasing life and energy: also to constitute of the material world a
grand, perfect, and harmonious System, the whole of which is an exterior demonstration of the interior harmony contained in all essential elements of Divine Love, Divine Life, and Divine Wisdom.
The seconld use consists in the fact that each form is a recipient for
the influx of inferior particles of matter, for the recombination of these,
and for the effluxation of the same into the first degree of  higher
forms.  So each formn in each kingdom  of creation is a polygastric
composition that subserves the purpose of receiving, digesting, and
transferring particles, to become the constituents of higher organizat.ions.  Every form is of itself a perfect stomach, and every particle





## p. 617 (#645) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   617
that flows into established forms in Nature, assumes the likeness and
qualities of the form which thus receives it.  Therefore every particle of matter proceeds by and through the medium of forms in Nature, to the highest degree of organic matter, by an unceasing gyration.  And every change of form  in matter is to the outer world
death or disorganization: for death is nothing more than a clange of
any organized form  or composition, as to its mode of existence.
But speaking in relation to the whole System of organized creation,
a death of form or principle can not possibly occur: for a chiange in
the form  of matter is neither death nor annihilation, but is only an
ascension and recombination, and consequently a new organization,
such as can only be constituted of the ascending forms in Nature.
Therefore the use of formins in their second degree of external being,
is to convey the inferior particles of matter, constituting their own
and lower compositions, to higher planes of organic development.
Forms, in every case, are mediums of communication between the
lower degrees of matter and the highest organization in Nature, which
is Man.  And forming, as they do, this medium, they constitute
of the whole system  of the outer world an harmonious and inseparable creation, all parts of which are mutually dependent upon each
other.
The third use of forms is discoverable in their perpetual tendency
to perfect and sublimate all inflowing particles of matter.  All forms,
then, are the established organs by whichl gross and inferior particles
are purified and refined, in order that they may become suitable to
enter into, and create and sustain, the highest form of matter, which
is Man.  Thus the mineral assists to perfect particles by which the
vegetable is created, sustained, developed, and perfected.' So also
the latter, in its turn, purifies and recombines atoms of matter, which
thus become unsuited to remain in the vegetable world, and ascend
immediately to the animal creation, which is thus produced, sustained,
and perfected.  So with the whole animal plane of creation: this in
like manner performs its specific office, renderinlg particles of matter
suitable to enter into, and to compose, the human organization.  Then
the latter Form comprehends and subsists upon them all, receivingo
constantly into its composition the particles of purified and refined
matter that flow through all the subordinate forms up to itself.
Another department of this use in animated forms is, that they establish a perfect principle of affinity, of affection, of association, of
reciprocation, of harmony, and unity of action, and display an insep

618             NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
arable relation to each other, all of which united binds together the
whole system of Nature as one grand and stupendous Whole.
iSti. Thus it is made manifest that all material things are forms,
each of which is merely an external mode by which its interior essence establishes a communication between itself and the outer world,
the form being only a medium of communication between the inner
and the outer.  Nature, then, is composed of these innumerable
combinations of matter, and is a manifest type of the whole Universe.
The Great Positive MIind is the Interior and Divine Essence-is
the creative Cause of all external effects.  The Great Divine Mind
is a SOUL, existing as a perfect organization of essential properties,
essences, and attributes; and the Mode by which this Essence or
Soul exists, is the Form or outward development of the whole UNIVERCCELUM.  The Divine Essence being the Soul, the Univerccelum
is the Body.  Moreover, the latter is a perfect representative, or, in
other words, is a bold and clear expression of the interior possessions
of the Divine Mind.  The Universe is the NMode by which the Divine Essence exists: and the latter could not exist as an Organization without being made perfect by a corresponding exterior Form,
such as is displayed in the mighty, grand, and inexpressibly-harmonious Universe.
Thus it is that form  is the express image of its interior or first
principle of life and being.  And the use of everything is determined
by the specificness of its own interior possessions, and especially by
its relation in form, in series, and in degrees of perfection, to all other
living essences in Nature and the Universe.
It is on the same principle that the human~ form is an express likeness of the quality of its interior soul.  And it has been absolutely
demonstrated that man materiatlly is a perfection of all matter in Nature, and that man spiritually is a perfection of all Motion.  Therefore man as a whole, constitutes a complete system  of organized
spirit and matter; and thus it is that the spiritual principle of man is
individualized, and is expressed by the human form, to the outer
world.  And thus likewise is the body unfolded by the specific and
potential essence of its interior soul.  Man is above all forms in being, and all congregations of forms; for he is the point, centre, and
goal, to which all other forms flow and are perfected, refined, and
made useful to the whole constitution of Nature and the Universe,





## p. 619 (#647) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 619
Meanwhile man in reality is invisible to the material senses; but all
that sensuous observers know of man is derived only from his exterior
representative and express likeness, which is the outward form that
his inward being assumes.
From these considerations it is made clear that every human form
possesses an organized interior principle by which the exterior is determined and developed.  And as the body performs its use considered as a medium  by which the inner man communicates with the
outer world, so does the inner principle perform a use in establishing
a connexion with the interior world.  So the human body individualizes the spirit in its relation to the outer world, while the spirit now
connected with the body determines the perpetuity and identical existence of the spirit in its connexion with the inner world, the sp)iritual form being also an expression of its interior soul.  Thus it is that
the soul is a prior organization; and when unfolding itself to the outer
world, it only assumes a coating, a body, a form, suited to its existence in this rudimental sphere of material and spiritual creation.
As everything is constantly assuming forin, which is an express
likeness of its interior cause, so the soul is constantly evolving
thoug/hts, which are suggested by influences proceeding from  the
outer, or from the promptings of its own internal principles: and the
tlhought is theforzn of these suggestions.  The forms of thoughts are
words-these always being the express likeness of the thought
evolved.  Not that any form in being, especially the humnan form, is
an exact expression in aspect or feature, of the form and constitution
of its soul-but the general form is always the express image of the
soul that produced it.  The aspect or features of a form are not the
form itself; but these are the collateral appendages, which of themnselves are no decided expression, only as they are animated and
configurated by the active suggestions of the spirit within.  But
what is well to understand is, that the exterior form  of man is the
express representation of its productive essence, the soul.  Hence
form is not the shape or aspect of any substance whose general form
is uniformly manifested. For while form is the mode by which
essence exists, and is the type of the essence, the aspcct, shap)e, and
features of the form, are merely the external particulars of the established structure, and are in no case decidedly expressive of the
image of the interior essence.

620             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
~ 182. We have now ascended in these psychological researches
to a consideration of the specific attributes of the soul of man, their
relations to each other, and their modes of manifestation fiom  the
inner to the outer world.  For the question is now fully and irrefutably answered, What is man spiritually? Likewise it is proved, that
the soul of man is a decided and established organization, preserving
its identity by virtue of the peculiar character of its own constitution,
and by the absence of all affinities which could absorb it in anything
else. It has been made clear that every soul is differently constructed,
this being manifest from the varieties and peculiarities of the human
species. Every soul is thus individually organized, and can not by
any possible means become blended or inter-associated with others in
such a way as that the soul's individual existence would be annihilated or immersed in the great ocean of moving and intangible substances.  The law of association determines the perpetuity of every
soul's identity, in both the material and spiritual world: for being
in constitution dissimilar to each other and to all things, they can not
become annihilated or disorganized.
The law of eternal progression also governs the constant development of all forms, both of a material and spiritual nature.  And from
the tendencies of this law flow all affinities, affections, relations,
forms, and degrees of refinement.  So each law develops forces and
tendencies corresponding to the peculiarities of the forms that need
to be actuated and governed unchangeably.  Then it is proved that
the soul of man (which is himselfj, with its form (which is its body),
is an organized essence, such as can not be annihilated or lost as to
its identity. For the dissimilarity of men not only establishes their
identity in respect to the outer, but also in respect to the inner.
And being thus differently combined, they can not associate with
each other in such a manner as to become individually lost in a general commingling mass: but each, according to the law of eternal
association, must necessarily preserve his own identity.  And men
will approach each other's spheres only as they are mutually congenial on the outer, in all worlds of spiritual existence, as well as in the
physical world.
Everything is developed in Order and Form, and all things
united form one mighty external expression of Infinite Wisdom, one
of the essential attributes of the Divine Mind.  Everything is actuated primarily by Light and Life; which are also an outward expression of Divine Thought, or of that potential essence which is





## p. 621 (#649) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 621
Love. Thus Light and Life are Love, and Order and Form are
Wisdom.
These considerations, I repeat, advance the subject to another
train of thought, which is to be confined exclusively to the human
soul itself. And it will be found that the previous revealments contain within themselves latent arguments whose strength and tendency
are not as yet perceived.
It has been said that sensation is the highest subordinate element
of the soul, and hence becomes the medium of communication between the soul and the form, and through the form, with the material
world.  This truth is fully exemplified in the animal creation; for
the highest element of their constitution is this principle or medium
of sensation.  Thus all animals are governed according to the
promptings of Nature; that is, they have suggestions fiom the outer
only, which they invariably obey.  All their movements are strictly
mechanical, being in every instance created by outward influences
which affect the sensation.  This being affected, creates inclination;
and this operates upon the will to accomplish its gratification.  The
animal, however, possesses a decided will, which serves as a moderator, and acts very much upon, and modifies the, external suggestions that are presented for gratification: and this will, combined
with their mechanical ingenuity displayed in escaping danger and in
procuring gratification, has been termed instinct, and sometimes absolute wisdom.  The animal, however, has no mental possessions
sufficient of themselves to be a governor; for all the causes of movement, ingenuity, experience, instinct, and wisdom, perceptible in
animals, are situated on, and proceed from, the outer.  The) are
influences that operate upon the sensation, and thus create a desire
for gratification: and this desire may be called the ruling love of animals.  For whatever they desire or choose to indulge in, is such
only as gratifies the element of sensation, which is the actuating soul
and prompter of all their external movements.
The vegetable possesses motion and life.  Thus its particles are,
constantly changing, and the whole structure is constantly passing
through various stages of development.  But the animal possesses
motion, life, and sensation, combined.  Motion governs the constant
action of the constituent particles of its body: life is displayed in the
energy and animation of the form; and sensation is the soul or moving principle by which it is made to act, and from which are evolved
all inclinations and desires. Motion can exist where life and sensa





## p. 622 (#650) ############################################


622             NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
tion do not; but life can not exist where motion is not, nor can sensation exist where life and motion are absent.  This makes it clear
that one is unfolded from the other; and sensation, being the highest
of them all, and connected with the human soul, fortns the actuating
principle of the animal, and establishes a perfect adaptation between
its organization, with its ruling loves and passions, and all things in
which it habitually indulges.
As sensation is the highest property of tile animal's spiritual
essence, it becomes the lowest of the spiritual essence of man.
Thus, as has been related, it establishes a communication between
the inner principle of man and external Nature.  Hence, I say, sensation is the lowest element of the human soul, and is the animating
principle which flows spontaneously from the animal into the human
form.
~ 1S3. It now becomes necessary to classify the parts of the soul,
in order to conceive of the relation which they sustain to each other,
and of the three great essential parts, which correspond to end, cause,
and efcct.  The end or ultimate design in prospect, is always the
cause, which cause institutes an effect; and both of these are engaged
in accomplishing the end.
I discover, then, that the soul is composed of three distinct parts;
and these are LovE, WILL, and WISDOM.
LOVE is the first or rudimental element of the human soul.  It is
that liquid, mingling, delicate, inexpressible element which is felt in
the depths of every human spirit, because it is its germinal essence.
WILL is a living force which serves as the connecting medium
between Love and Wisdom, being subject to the influence and suggestions of each.  It is the innate consciousness of energy, or force;
and it has been supposed to be an absolutely-independent element
of the mind, beyond the possibility of being influenced by external
captivations.
WISDOM is the perfection of Love. It is the sealing element of
the human soul; it is the establishment of the soul's perfect constitution.  XWisdom flows from love, is directed by experience, modified
by will, and rendered perfect by knowledge. Wisdom is the thinking
principle, the faculty that cogitates, investigates, searches, and explores, the fields of terrestrial and celestial existence. It is the faculty
that analyzes, calculates, and imperatively commands obedience
fiom all the subordinate possessions of Will and Love.





## p. 623 (#651) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   623
These three parts of the human soul, then, being designated, I
will descend into some considerations relative to their mode of rnanifestation through the body in the outer world, in order that the great
question respecting the powers and actuating principles of the human
soul may become settled, and equally comprehended by all.
LOVE being the first element, or the essence of the soul, is accordingly imperfect, unguided, and, like the lower forms in Nature, is
developed angularly.  It is the parent of eccentricity, impulse, fantasy, imagination, and inflated conceptions of all things invisible, intangible, and unreal.  Also Love is the element of tenderness, kindness, affection, attachment, and of all kinds of pure and unsophisticated sentiments, such as gush spontaneously from  the depths of
the soul, and are' expressed in music, in language, in paintings, in
foliage, in embroidery, and in all the indescribable beauties that line
the vaulted chambers of the expanded heavens.  Love is the element
that conceives of all loveliness, of gentleness, of sweetness, of fragrance, and of beauty, in all their various modes of exterior manifestation.
Love gives rise to an affection for other forms, or fo)r mankind
generally.  To gratify this affection, men form societies, associations,
communities, brotherhoods, sects, and congregations, as these are
exemplified in the outer world.
Love also manifests itself in conjugal attachment; wlhich is outwardly expressed in individual association and matrimony.  And tllis
same love is modified into a love for mankind generally: and this
begets families, sects, and associations.
Love has also an affection for music.  This is outwardly expressed
even in the confusion of sounds that are invented by the uncultivated
inhabitants of the earth, and which they endeavor to express by employing instruments of the most imperfect and discordant character.
The sounds created are always in accordance with the wisdoin of
this love; and thus, on the other hand, this insuppressible affection
for musical harmony has also led to the invention of delicate and
finely-constructed instruments, by which it expresses itself outwardly
in the most delicate and harmonious sounds, which have a corresponding influence upon the thoughts and conceptions of the soul.
Love involves an affection for the beautiful.  This is expressed
in the outer world by the construction of forms of the most perfect
symmetry, and by ideal embodiments of what is angelic and celes.
tial: also by beautiful expressions, or superior combinations of words





## p. 624 (#652) ############################################


624            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
expressive of the eloquence of the soul, and likewise of the inward
conceptions of the beautiful.  Statuary and symmetrical forms of every variety are constructed; mansions, edifices, and temples, are
erected according to the most perfect conceptions of the grand, the
beautiful, and the magnificent.  Gardens of shrubbery and flowers
are planned according to a conception of perfect order and beauty.
-And all of these are but expressions of love as it assumes this specific direction.
Love hads also an affection for the invisible and the sublime —-the
outward expressions of which are the many ideal conceptions that
clothe themselves in words, and which also infuse into all the other
affections an element of chastity, refinement, and amiability.  This
affection of the love imparts grace, ease, and elegance, to every external expression of the other affections of love.
Love has an affection for self-which is expressed by the ingenious, secretive, and unrighteous plans that are invented for purposes
of self-emolument; by the many disturbances that occur in society;
by the destruction of life; by the employment of deceptive expressions; and by all those unreal and unsanctified forms and corrupt
inventions, which, through the misdirection of this affection, prevail
throughout the whole human brotherhood.
Love involves the affection of unbounded benevolence.  This is
openly expressed by the formation of societies and institutions, and
by all those great and mighty movements that are so much admired
by all expanded minds, for their tendency to an amelioration of the
condition of mankind, and to the ultimate establishment of distributive justice and universal righteousness.
Love has an affection for the just.  This is openly expressed by
all the conscientious relations that exist between man and man, and
by those exchanges which are just and reciprocal.  This love is the
love of the moral, of the holy, and of the righteous.  It is the love
which conceives of all Divine perfection, and which creates all yearnings for purity, refinement, and distributive goodness.  It is that
which breathes an affection for all that is of the Divine Mind, and
for all those exalted and moral sentiments which constitute the higlhest attributes of man.
Another affection of love gives rise to hope.  This clothes itself
in an aerial garment of contemplation, anticipation, and expectation,
of all that which is desired by the other affections of love.
Love also embraces an affection for the food which enters into





## p. 625 (#653) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 625
man's material form.  This love expresses itself outwardly in procuring and delicately combining food, and committing it to the stoniach.  It leads to the cultivation of those portions of the vegetable
and animal kingdoms which contribute most to its gratification.  It
leads also to a great variety of preparations of food, and it is constantly expressing itself by imparting delicious flavors to the vegetable
and animal substances that are agreeable to its desires and suitable to
the requirements of the human body.
Thus it is seen that Love, as the germ  of the human soul, has
various modes of manifestation; and these consist in. the external and
ingenious inventions and structures that are existing in the world.
A more definite understanding will hereafter be obtained concerning
Love, when I proceed to consider the modifying tendency of Wisdom, which is the proper controlling influence of all the affections
embraced in the love-principle.
~ 184. From the faculty of Love, as the basis of the soul, flowvs
the faculty of WILL.  This then becomes the mediatorial faculty
of the human mind, and is the means employed by Love to accomplish whatever end it desires. Herein are made plain the three mo,ving principles engaged in accomplishing any end conceived of and'
desired.  Love perceives and conceives that which is congenial to,
its affections.  The end to be attained is the cause of Love's prompting the Will to act upon the body in order to accomplish it.  In
other words, Will is employed as a means by Love to attain thile end:
for which it has an affection.
Will in all cases is subject to the promptings of the element of
Love, and its acts in all cases originate in the suggestions. thence derived. Will is the faculty employed to move the body in the performance of any external work for the accomplishment: of which the
Love has conceived an affection.  Love conceives of the end or
object which would be suited to its affection, and gratifying to its!
desires; and the perception of this is the primary cause of the Love's
prompting the Will to act for its accomplishment..  The Will, however, is a living force, a perfect faculty, and a decided portion of thesoul.  By its inherent possessions and influence, the body is mades
to move; and all the changing attitudes of the latter are the exteriors
forms and projections of the faculty of Will. Ini other words, Will'
evolves thoughts, as they are suggested by. thne workings of Love anlld,:

Love's affections; and these thoughts of the Will are expressed in
manifest forms to the outer world-that is, in the assumed appearances and movements of the body, and in all external actions that are
put forth by it.  All these are the exterior forms of the thoughts
evolved by Will.  The latter being a means employed by Love to
institute, construct, or create, any form for which the Love has conceived an affection, it is therefore a mediator and means by which
all motion, all construction, and all exterior manifestations, are produced.
Will has no independent action, and can not institute a movement
of itself: but it moves only as it is excited and prompted by the
Love.  Love, therefore, is the primary cause of external action; and
Will is the ffect produced: and the effects of this, again, are the
exterior things which it accomplishes.  In other words, Will is employed by Love to develop externally the expression of its own,thoughts.
If a man has in view the construction of a beautiful edifice, the,exterior and interior portions of which are perfectly defined in the
mind, it is because he has first conceived of the uses which the edi-,fice with.its various portions may fulfil. And as it is the use that
plans and arranges the whole construction, it may be said that the,plan of the edifice, as to proposed form and appearance, precisely
corresponds to, and represents, the use, the conception of which was
the cause of the plan's being instituted.
Again, it may be said that the use to which the edifice is adapted,corresponds precisely to the form of his affections, or the prompting
desires of his love.  Having the use and plan properly impressed,upon the mind, his love for the attainment of the end prompts the
Will to action, which implicitly obeys, and external movements are
at once instituted for the construction and completion of the edifice.
Then the edifice in its parts also corresponds to the isolated moveinents of the Will among the materials which are adapted to its structure, and which serve to form the perfect Whole.
As the use perceived, suggested the form and structure of the
building, so the building corresponds to the use to which it is adapt*ed; and the building and its use connectedly represent the affection,or conception of the Love. Thus the Love has openly expressed
its thought; and this expression consists in the edifice which has
ibeen erected.  It is thus seen that the cause of the building is invallved in the use to which it is adapted.  This operates upon the

Love; and this, again, prompts the Will: and thus the end is act
complished.
~ 185. The third faculty of the soul is evolved from Will and
Love, and is the highest and most perfect one; and this joins and
pervades the others, so that the three form a perfect Whole.  This
faculty is WISDOM.
The office of Wisdom  is to listen silently to the suggestions of
Love and Will, and to modify these according to reason, form, order, and perfect harmony. Love without Will would be eccentric,
impulsive, disorderly, and confused, even to such an extent that the
whole system  of Nature would be nothing more. than a vast congregation of disorganized forms. Everything would be misplaced,
misformed, misconstructed, and rendered useless to the requirements
of man. But Love being modified by Will, becomes at once limnited as to its circle of movement, and confined in its conceptions to
a definite sphere.  Yet Love and Will would both be eccentric and
ungoverned in their movements among material things, were it not
for the presence of Wisdom, which presides over and directs them
both. Wisdom is contained in the germ of the soul, which is Love
-is developed in the body, which is Will-and perfected in the
flower, which is itself.'Wisdom, then, pervades, directs, modifies,
and governs them all, because it is the crowning faculty of the soul,
and the most perfect of all its attributes.
Will, then, is the perfection of Love, and hence receives, contains, and continually manifests, all the qualities, thoughts, affections,
and desires of Love.  And Wisdom  is the perfect form of them
both, because Wisdom is an ultimate progression of them; and it is
a representation of all their latent qualities and unexpressed affections. Wisdom- is that faculty of the soul which gives order and
form to all things in the outer world; and Love gives to order and
form light, life, taste, grace, and elegance.  And'Will is the executive faculty between'Wisdom and Love, and obeys perpetually the
suggestions of Love as these are sanctioned by Wisdom.
The eccentricity of Love and Will is very much modified by the
pervading and controlling influence of Wisdom, which becomnos their
director, governor, and lord. Were it not for Wisdom, order, form,
and adaptation, would not be known, either in the natural or artificial world. So, then, the outward form of' Wisdom is the perfect
order and uniformity displayed in the outer world.  The perfect

form of Love is the use for which all external things are designed
and adapted.  Love is also.expressed in the life, grace, and elegance,
which render every exterior form lovely and admirable.
Thus it is seen that Wisdom is the great head and flower of the
liuman soul, and that it is perpetually engaged in the evolution of
thoughts which clothe themselves in material things in the outer
world. The more Wisdom is permitted to act, the more its sphere
of action is extended, and the more will the natural and artificial
world display beauty, order, and harmony.  But the more it is restricted in its action, and the less its teachings are heeded, the more
will Nature and the artificial creations of man becorne a disorganized
and useless system, instead of displaying peace, order, beauty, and
universal reciprocation.  Love is only the life of things; Will is the
means employed to obtain a desired end; but Wisdom is the order,
beauty, harmony, and perfection of them,all.
The Great Divine Mind, in essence, is Love: this is the light and
life of the Universe. The Universe itself is the Body of Love, and
its perfect Form.  But Wisdom  is the highest attribute, and the
great ultimate of eternal Design.  And Wisdom  gives to Light and
Life a Body-and to this Body, Order and Form. The whole is
rendered thereby an harmonious System, each outward form being a
perfect representative of its creative cause.
The following, then, are the three Parts of the great and universal
System: The Divine.Mind, or Love, which is the Soul; the Universe, which is the Form, Means, Mediator, and Body; and Spirit,
which is the Order, the Form, the Wisdom, and the GRAND DESIGN
of the whole System of the Univerccelum. The End primarily designed to be accomplished was the individualization of the human
spirit; and for the attainment of this, Cause and Effect were brought
into requisition.  The Divine Mind is the Cause, the Universe is the
Effect, and Spirit is the ultimate Design.  The truth of this is demonstrated in every department of this terrestrial sphere, and is particularly exemplified in the nature and developments of the human
soul, which are in exact correspondence with the great System  of
the Universe.  Everything is perpetually displaying, in its inward and
outward movements, End, Cause, and Effect; and Ligldt and Life
are Love, and Order and Form are Wisdom.*
* It may be well here to remark, once for all, upon these expressions, that " Light
and Life" mean simply the conception of the end desired, and the activity which en.
sues as tending toward its accomplishment. The two combined constitute the prin

It is highly necessary, then, that the human mind should comprehend the great truth that nothing exists in the outer world except as it
is produced and developed by an interior essence, and that of this
essence the exterior is the perfect representative.  Among all the
various arts and sciences that now exist in the world, may be found
demonstrations of this truth, and also of its vast importance.  Forms
do not exist with the mechanic or with the artist, merely as productions of the outer combinations of matter; but every form invented
by man is a precise representative of the interior thought which is
the cause of its creation.  Every form  is such as corresponds to the
inward suggestion of Love, and is created by the living effort of
Will, and modified and rendered perfect by the admonitions and
directions of Wisdom.
~ 186. Metaphysicians have devoted much time to discussing
questions concerning the innate consciousness of the soul, "free
will," " necessity," and the nature and relations of the faculties. The
faculties thought to compose the various portions of the soul, have
been minutely classified under the general divisions of propensities,
sentiments, and intellectual faculties.  The first of these are represented as relating to self and to things in the outer world; the second
as giving rise to moral conceptions and the sense of justice; and the
third as comprising the powers of reason, analysis, and investigation.
Many such classifiers have given to the soul the faculty of absolute
free will, or a power to act or not to act in any specified manner,
uninfluenced by any interior or external thing.  They have also
given to the soul innate faculties perpetually disposed to wickedness
and abomination, delighting to indulge in every species of evil and
licentiousness, thirsting to injure mankind, to destroy life, and seeking, by a sacrifice of all moral principles, one's own emolument.
Meanwhile, such metaphysicians have believed the human mind to
be possessed of absolute independence as to its powers of action,
and have disconnected it from the influence of every material thing.
I now discover why all these opinions have arisen, and why they
have become embodied in all the philosophical and metaphysical
ciple of Love, which is nothing more than an operative attraction toward an end or
object first definitely conceived in the mind. " Order and Form" mean the perfect
organization and arrangement: and as Wisdom alone can prescribe a consistent
organization and arrangement, and such as would be permanently gratifying to the
Love, so the Order and Form displayed when the organization and arrangement are
completed, are considered as a perfect embodiment or expression of Wisdom.

b30            NAIURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
systems which most prevail. It is because the mind can not analze,
and comprehend itself.  I moreover discover that the soul has no
such inherent propensities and desires for evil and unrighteousness
-that it has no desire to injure, or to dissemble, or to be deceptive.
Moreover, I discover that it has no absolute independence, and
that all those metaphysical theories are decidedly untrue —merely
because they have sprung from the superficial conceptions of the
mind, and not from a knowledge of its interior and divine essence.
It is given me to know that the human soul is, in a low degree,
an express image and likeness of the Great Positive Mind, and that
it is an offspring of the incessant and successive developments
of those mighty attributes which, connectedly, are the cause of ALL
THINGS.
The cause of, these metaphysical misconceptions, I repeat, lies in
the fact that no substance, or compound, or mind, possesses within
itself the power of self-investigation.  Tlie germ can not understand
its own qualities, but the perfect development can; because it is a
higher and unfolded state of the qualities of the germ, and is thereby
enabled to comprehend all below its exalted state of being.  So
the human mind can comprehend all that is below it, but can not
either comprehend itself or any higher degrees or spheres of animtnation. And thus, were it not that I am permitted to occupy a higher
sphere of thought and observation, the soul would also appear to me
as an indefinite and ambiguous consciousness which is neither to be
comprehended as embracing any form, order, or substance, tangible
to the senses.
Man, when investigating, the faculties, propensities, and tendencies,
of the soul, inquires outwardly-and thus the evidence on which
legitimate conclusions might be based necessarily escapes his attention. This evidence would otherwise gush from the promptings of
his own interior self, and proclaim truthful conclusions and their
demonstration.  Herein, then, is found the reason why man has not
as yet understood his own nature and composition.  The reason
why all these evil propensities have been attributed to man as inherent in the nature of his soul, is, that men have confined themselves
to the outer plane of observation, and have there beheld the fantastic
misdirections of the human love-of love unguided and unmodified
by the admonitions of Wisdom.  They judge merely from the extertals or clothings of things, and from -these accuse the affections of the
soul of being degenerated, degraded, and absolutely evil.  By be

holding the inconsistent movements of men, the mind conceives at
once of the misdirection of Love and Will, and of their misapplication as respects the individual and general benefit of the race.  And
in order to create harmony in all things, and beauty and utility in al,
external forms, it is necessary to inform  and develop the human
Wisdom; and this will immediately dissipate all confusion and disorder in the outer world, and make all things useful, harmonious,
and reciprocal.
187. Remember that the outer forms will correspond to the
condition of the interior man.  Remember, too, that Wisdom is the
grand faculty of the human soul, and that it must occupy a position
cornnmmanding and pre-eminent.  It should exert an influence over
all' the subordinate faculties and affections of the soul, and they
should (and will ultimately) bow in obedience to its mandates.
Wisdom is tile lord of creation: for by it the fields of the vegetable kingdom are rendered fertile and useful, and the forms in the animal world are made to fuilfil the office for which they were designed,
and to benefit and administer to the happiness of the human race.
By it Love is directed, and all its affections are modified and rendered useful.  By it the various objects that are created by Love,
are all adapted to uses and made beneficial to mankind.
Love enjoys intercourse with the outer world by and through the
medium  of sensation.  Were it not for this latter, commerce would
not exist i for it is by this only that the human soul can sympathize
with things on the outer, and conceive of uses adapted to its nature
and constitution; and it is by this that the soul is enabled to enjoy
the incessant inflowings of the elements of all material things.  It is
by this medium that Love breathes forth an affection for external
things; and it is by this that the inner and the outer are enabled to
associate with each other. Therefore, by Wisdom should Love be
directed; and notwitlistanding its conceptions and affections are ambiguous, eccentric, and imaginative, a well-developed Wisdom never
permits an action of the Will before those affections are essentially
modified, according to principles of utility.
Will is likewise under the the potential direction of Wisdom.
Whenever the faculty of Will is instigated by Love to perform an
external act, Wisdom perceives the suggestion, conceives of its use,
and directs the Will-force to its accomplishmlllent.  Will is some

632            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
times actuated by Love alone; and this is when the faculty of Wisdom is undevelpped —and then the exterior manifestations of Will
are impulsive, unreasonable, and often injurious to the well-being of
man.  When Will is thus acted on, the consequences are injurious
to the general harmony and required unity of all things.  A  knowledge of this fact shows the importance of a universal elevation of the
human mind, and of its being properly instructed concerning its own
interior nature, and also concerning its relation to the outer world.
It shows that the form or body should be superiorly situated in order
to cause a proper development of the intellect; and this can only be
accomplished by following the dictates of a well-constituted and welldeveloped Wisdom.
The cause of disunity in the actions, feelings, and affections, of
men, is to be found in the uneducated condition and misdirection of
the faculties of the human soul, and not in their innate depravity, or
tendency to sin.  The cause of every species of licentiousness and
immorality, and of the unrestrained action of what are now called the
baser passions of the soul, is found only in the ignorance, folly, and imbecility, of minds unguided by the faculty of Wisdom. Then, again, it
is clear that these things would not exist were the human race spiritually elevated, and their faculties so expanded as that nothing  would
exist but the perfect Order and Form of Wisdomn. This wouldl (and
will) be universal harmony, distributive justice, equal love to the
neighbor, and brotherly kindness and charity.  Let every one, then,
desist from  proclaiming metaphysical hypotheses derogatory to the
innate divineness.of-the human soul, and rise to the plane of interior
and natural thought-and then let all their external movements correspond, not to the hereditary affections and belief of the Love, but
to the unrestricted sanctions of a well-instructed and well-developed
WISDOM.
Here, then, is the reason why men lhave so long adhered to the
imaginative beliefs of their Love, and not listened to the spontaneous
teachings of their judgment.  Hereditary opinions of every kind are
merely the early impressions made upon the Love.  But nen wlho
discard all hereditary affection for thought are those in whotm is developed the highest faculty of the soul, which is Wisdom.  From
this they receive and impart instruction; by it all their external Inovements are governed; and all their constructions and inventions, which
are prompted by the Love,1are by it made perfect in Order and
Form.

~ 188. Men in general believe that they have power to act independently of all influences, either from interior promptings or the
suggestions of the outer world.  Of the truth of this they suppose
they have an internal consciousness-feeling, as they do, a sense of
a self-existent power to move according to a desire of the Will,
which appears to be born of and governed by itself.  The reason of
this conviction is plain: No man has the power within himself to
perceive the relation and connexion existing between each portion
of the soul; and therefore all the conceptions which man can have
of himself internal are only shadowy, intangible, and unsatisfactory.
He feels a conviction that he exists and moves independently of every other tangible form, and uninfluenced by any apparent cause.
He feels that he has the power to do or not to do anytlhing which
presents itself to the mind.  He feels that he possesses strength and
independence to receive or reject, to act or not to act; and he has
been taught to believe that he is a "frce agent," unacted on, uninfluenced, ungoverned, and unrestrained, in any of his actions.
The cause of this inward conviction lies in the individual workings
of the three parts of the soul, which are Love, Will, and Wisdom.
It has been shown that Love prompts action, both fiom its own interior workings and also by its desires excited by material things holding a close relation to the sensation of the body.  Love is thus the
primary cause of all action, of all will, and of all thouglht, in tile human soul.  The transition of thoughlt fiom Love to Will is imperceptible; and at the moment thought arouses the Will to volition, a
man feels conscious that he has power to withstand the impulse, and
remain unmoved.  This conviction is truthful; but this does not
establish the independence of the will-force of the soul: for Will in
all cases is a passive faculty, never acting unless prompted by foreign
influences or interior carises.
Furthermore, a man can not be conscious of tile transition of
thought from the faculty of Will to Wisdom; and the moment this
latter faculty is brought into requisition, he apparently experiences an
additional strength, and the conviction of an independent power of
action.  The reason of this is equally plain: the will-force seldom
acts without first receiving approbation firom the faculty of Wisdom;
and the hesitation which occurs in the mind between the periods of
the suggestion of Love and the sanction of the Wisdom, impresses
the conviction upon the mind that there is a choice or independence
of action residing within the Will itself. Man feels an ilnpulse to





## p. 634 (#662) ############################################


634            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
move, but hesitates; and this is an indication of the workings ann
deliberations of the Wisdorn.  And wthen it sanctions, the mind feels
consciously impelled onward; and the person manifests great force
and firmness, and presses forward with an innate conviction of prudence, justice, and truth, and thus feels an interior approbation.
This always occurs with minds well constituted and superiorly developed.
But the Wisdom itself is not a faculty self-instructed and uninfluenced by interior or external things; for the judgment is developed
by interior and outward experience, fi'om which it learns policy, prudence, order, harmony, and propriety, as to its movements in reference to its associate faculties, and its interior direction in respect to
outward action.
When the Will is impressed with an irresistible impulse fiom the
Love, it sometimes acts without consulting or listening to the admonitions of the Wisdom.  When this is the case, a man feels an innate consciousness of violation, and an unnerving s6nse of impropriety and injustice. He experiences an inward conviction of guilt,
and of ingratitude to the silent but constant promptings of the Wisdom.  And the internal condemnation which he feels results from
the disapprobations of the judgment; and the workings of a violated
conscience are expressed in the configurations of the countenance.
Thus it is seen that the Will is a passive faculty, subject to the
command and action of the Love and Wisdom.  There exists a
perpetual strife between the suggestions of the Love and the approbations of the judgment.  This would not exist if nien would turn
their attention to the cultivation of their interior faculties, so that they
might recognise the great principles of the Universe, and thus learn
to live in their external sphere of movement in a correspondinglyharmonious manner.  Then the judgment would always be the supreme and governing faculty among the other departments of the
human soul; and then would all things in the outer world precisely
correspond to its dictates. When Wisdom assumes an irnmoveable
position on the throne of the interior world or the soul, then will all
other faculties, as subjects, be influenced, directed, and governed with
a righteous government.
Thus the conviction of the soul's independence arises from an insufficient development of the faculty of Wisdom, fiom the misdirection of all the faculties, and especially from the very superficial modes
of educating them which prevail.





## p. 635 (#663) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                635
Will, I repeat, is a passive faculty. It is, however, not only the
receptacle of thought, but a faculty of thought itself; and it is also a
medium of communication between the Love and Wisdom. Hence
it is that when thoughts are evolved from the will-force, nlan feels
that he has an independence of action and a " fiee will" uninfluenced.
I say it is when the thoughts are evolved from the Will, and not when
the Will prompts the system to outward movement, that a man conceives of the freedom of his own Will. For when volition is produced, the judgment takes cognizance of the operations of the Will.
Then, again, a man sometimes feels a conviction of " fiee will"
when his judgnment evolves the thlought, and while the Will is engaged in perpetual volition.
Tile combinations of the soul are of themselves an enigma beyond
the possibility of any mind to solve. And it is the evanescertness
of the action of each faculty that gives rise to the interior conviction
of " free will."  Another cause of this conviction is that man does
not individualize the specific promptings and suggestions of the internal.  He therefore becomes confused in the general evolution of
thought, and rushes to erroneous conclusions, and adopts unsound
principles of metaphysical speculation.
And man is incessantly subject to the suggestions of Love and the
promptings of,thoughts which the judgment disapproves.  Thus he
feels a constant antagonism within his own being; that is, between
the lower affections and desires of Love, and the approbations of the
Wisdorn.  Meanwhile Will, as the mediator between the two other
faculties, is passive. A man may feel impressed to act in a given
way, yet he obeys not the impulse, and says, " I will not, until my
mind is convinced of the propriety of so doing."  This certainly is
a most truthful acknowledgment of absolute dependence, and is an
expression flowing from an undecided judgment.  Man always makes
himself, or the pronoun I, the subject of action, or the acted on,
whenever the judgment directs or approves an external action.  In
the expression, " I will not act until my judgment approves the action," the pronoun I represents the Will or passive faculty; while
the terms " my judgment" represent the higher faculty, which is the
Wisdoin.  And as the Wisdom  is dependent for its judgment, its
development, or its capabilities of discernment, upon the character
of the thoughts within, and the influences and experiences without,
it can not be truthfully said that this possesses an independent power





## p. 636 (#664) ############################################


636            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
of commanding  action, which could with any propriety be terrmed
"free will."
Hence the idea of the existence of " fiee will" proceeds from an
indistinct consciousness that pervades the whole workings of the soul.
The belief arises also from a confounding of the actions of the individual faculties, without perceiving the relations which they sustain
to outward things, to the forms which they inhabit, or to one another. Hence there exists no law, principle, or fact, which affords of
this belief the least particle of proof.
It has been said by some metaphysicians, and especially by Lockle
and Plato, that the " free will" of man is proved by his superiority
over all the other forms in Nature; that the animal is governed by an
instinctive impulse, and by influences that proceed from surrounding
things-while Man is prompted to act, and is at liberty to positively
refuse.  Thus it is said that he moves under a manifest fireedom of
the will.
The discerning mind will perceive instantly that this indicates a
very superficial view of the cause of action in the animal and human
form; and the hypothesis is assumed without analyzing the individual
faculties of the human soul, and their specific modes of action. Man
is only an elevated form among all the forms in Nature; and from
the variety of which he is a part, the whole is made a complete system, in which may be observed series, degrees, and states of progression, both as relate to the essence and the form, or the soul and the
body.  But there exists no proof in the perceptible superiority of
man over the lower creations that he possesses an independent power
of action, while all other things in the Universe are inseparably and
unchangeably united.
It certainly is evident that there is a species of independence possessed by every particle of matter in existence; and that consists
only in the fact that forms have an individual being.  In this sense
the term independence can be applied to all things.  But speaking
in reference to the whole System of divine creation, it can not be
said that there is any such thing as absolute independence; for all
things are but parts of one stupendous Whole-and from this is
demonstrated the unity and dependence of all things.
The numerous classifications that have been made of the phrenic
development of the soul, have no direct bearing upon the principles
herein advanced,-inasmuch as they are founded upon the anatoti

cal constitution of the brain, and are therefore external, and not
decidedly connected with any of the real-realities of the interior or
thinking principle.
~ 189. I next proceed to consider the spiritual and material SENSES, and their relations to the outer world.  But I discover that two
have been given to man which he does not possess except in a qualified sense, and then only as branches of others.
FEELING (or touch) is a distinct sense, and sustains a close relation to the faculty of Love.
HEARING, or the sense of external sound, is also a distinct sense,
and is conjoined with the united action of Love and Will, and especially with the Will, for it is by this faculty that this sense is rendered
a delicate medium of communication between the inner and outer
world.
The sense of SEEING is related to the faculty of Wisdom; and
hence it is subject to the Will. Seeing is always an act of the Will,
approved or permitted by the Wisdom; for a person may or may
not employ his organ of vision to behold material things.
But HEARING is a sense related to Love and Will; and hence
Will has no power to prevent the inflowing vibrations of sound. And
Touch is a sense related to Love alone, and is a connecting link
between the human faculties and the instincts of the animal creation.
Hence it is that the Will and Love have no power over it, and can
not govern the sensation produced by it, or mnodify the intrusions of
external things upon its susceptibility.
Two other senses have been recognised as belonging to man, and
these are Taste and Smell.  But this classification can not be true;
for taste and smell are confined to the sense of Touch, and their organs are only avenues through which peculiar sensations are received.
Smelling is subject neither to the judgment nor to the Will; nor is
the sense of Taste; for each of them, unlike the others, is subject to
be acted on, but has not power to resist external invasions.
It can be proved that the sense of Hearing depends upon the
medium  of Touch only primarily, for its power of communicating
sound to the internal, and that the details of its action, and its effects
upon the internal, are for the most part governed by the influence of
the Will and Wisdom. That is, sound is governed not so much by
the structure of the ear, as by the operation of the Will and Wisdom
upon it.  Thus sound is tendered by the judgment, gentle, conge

638              NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
nial, or repulsive; and that too by calling into action of the willforce.  I say, then, that this can be proved; and this will establish
the position of this sense between that of Touch and Vision: for
Hearing is a mediatorial sense.
Man, then, has three distinct senses: —the subordinate or suggestive sense, which is Touch; the passive or modifying sense, which
is Hearing; and the superior or protective sense, which is above and
over them all, and this is Seeing. Seeing is related especially to the
Wisdom; and both are watchful and careful to protect all the subordinate possessions of the interior and exterior form.  Hearing is a
medium  sense, related to the Will and Love, and is passive. Therefore it is subject to receive all sounds created or courted by love,
and to admit them into the interior, according to the modif)ying, tendency of the Wisdom. And Touch is the germinal or rudimental
sense, subject to the suggestions of Love, and the influence of outer
things upon the body.
It is now made manifest why man's external form corresponds to
and represents his interior being.  For it is now perceived that there
is a trinity in everything, and that there is a perfect likeness between
the external form  of man and the form  and structure of the soul.
The soul of man is thus proved to be a tangible reality; for it has
been made distinctly clear, even to the sensuous observer, thatforms
are created and determined only by their essence.  This all-important
truth applies to man and to the whole Universe.  To behold the soul
or spirit of man, then, observe his material mode of being.  Meanwhile consider that the real man is the internal, this only animating
the material form, in order that it may perfect its constitution and

It may not be improper to note a phenomenon which here occurred. Having
spoken for about three hours, and the fatigue incident to the protracted sitting posture of those present/having become somewhat severe, the lecturer paused and remarked to his magnetizer as follows: "I perceive that I shall now have to be absent
(that is, from the body) about six or seven minutes, during which time the scribe and
others of you may relieve your muscles by taking exercise." Ile then assumed his
usual inclined position, and remained rigid and statue-like, breathing vety slightly,
for about seven minutes, at the end of which period he returned with rather unusual
muscular convulsions, and under mental emotions which he could not entirely sup.

different and altogether higher subject; and as my impressions flow easily, I will now
proceed to give all that will precede the revelations on the spiritual spheres." He

~ 190. From  past considerations it is made clear that man materially is a perfection of all Matter in Nature; and that man spiritually
is a perfection of all Motion in the Universe, or of the First Great
Principle of Motion, which is the Divine Mind, whose Essence is
Love: and thatvman spiritually is constituted of the wisdom of Love.
It has also been shown that every form is unfolded by progressive
stages from the lower particles of matter to the perfect symmetry of
the material organization of man; and that the form or essence has
in like nmanner a(lvanced through successive degrees of development,
to the perfect spiritual organization.  Moreover, it has been shown
that the exterior or the form is the express likeness of its interior
essence, which latter has unfolded itself from  the inner to the outer
on the principle of end, cause, and effect.
And I am desirous of enforcing that great spiritual and eternal
truth which it is necessary for man to know and appreciate before lihe
can know himself and be happy: and that is, that all manifest substances, forms, compositionzs- indeed, that ALL THINGS VISIBLE, are
expressions of an interior productive cause, which is the spiritual essence: that the Mineral Kingdom  is an expression of Motion, the
Vegetalfe an expression of Life, the Animal an expression of Sensation, and that Man is an expression of Intelligence; that the planets
in our solar system are a perfect expression of the Sun from which
they sprang; that the various combined bodies and planetary systems
in the Universe are a perfect expression of the Great Sun of the
Univercelumn; that the Great Sun is a perfect expression of the
SPIRITUAL SUN within it; and that the Spiritual Sun is a perfect
expression of the Divine Mind, Love, or Essence.  The Spiritual
Sun is thus the Centre and Cause of all material things.  It is a diverging or radiating Sphere or-Atmosphere of the Great Eternal Cause.
It is an aroma —a garment and a perfect radiation of the more interior Essence, the Divine, Creative Soul.
Behold the truth —that the material Universe is a perfect representation of the spiritual Universe, in which nothing exists but what
is everlasting and infinite; that the whole material System is the Body
of the Creative Soul; and that the Spiritual Essence has unfolded
and manifested itself in a material Form!  And this Form  is the
Order and Wisdom of the Divine Mind.

remarks on the process of death, the whole duration of the sitting being upward of
four hours.

Light and Love constituted the first development of the Spiritual
Sun; and that was Light and Life inconceivable-a brilliancy that
extended throughout the height, and depth, and length, and breadth
of space —that became illuminated space itself; and yet space is not
limited, nor could it transcend the expansive illuminations of the
Great Spiritual Sun.  And when the Universe was completed, Order
and Form reigned omnipresent throughout the whole Univercoelum!
And such was the grand and stupendous Development of the Greal
Spiritual Sun-this having developed the Material Sun, and this the
expanded'Universe!
All things that man creates are such as represent his thoughts.
They are merely the outward expressions of the thoughts of his soul.
He creates nothing but what is a living evidence and representation
of a thought previously conceived.  This truth is useful as a guide
to the mind; for now, when the inquiry is made as to what the soul
is, where it is, how it exists, and what are the evidences- the tangible
evidences of its existence —this truth, which is now proved to be a
universal one, should be recalled to the mind: that all things tangible
are in reality the living evidences of the soul within, made manifest
to the material senses, and useful to the requirements of the outer
world.
Every mind must conceive of the existence of a Cause as the
parent of any effects visible to the senses.  And the cause must be
admitted as corresponding to the effect, or else the effect can not be
attributed to any producing cause. Hence it follows that all external
and visible things are effects, prompted, created, and unfolded to the
outer world, by a corresponding interior cause; and that the cause
must be the real reality, or else such tangible effects could not have
been produced.  So all material things created by man are the forms
of his thoughts; and these are the offspring of the soul.  The form
of man is a likeness, a type, a representative of the cause or soul
which animates and unfolds it to the outer world.  The outer senses
are typical of the inner ones; for they are unfolded from the corresponding parts of the interior essence.
And I feel authorized to affirm, from the nature of my impressions,
that if man were differently situated and superiorly educated, he would
not be so far removed from  the spiritual world as he now is in his
sphere of thought.  And, moreover, he would recognise the proper
w3e of all things, and apply them  to his wants, as directed by the

governor of all things, which is Wisdom.  And he would recognise
the relation existing between the natural and the spiritual world; and
that, too, without experiencing a metamorphosis or transformation of
the real man from the outer to the inner world.
Furthermore, I now discover that man, as to soul and form, becomes individualized in this sphere, and preserves his form henceforward, and knows no change; and that man exists in the other
world in a perfect human form, and among as many expressed forms
of essence, and as many projections of thought, as are existing in
this sphere of being.  I discover that the Second Sphere is unfolded
from this, the first, and that it is the perfect form of this its parent
and creator.
191. I would have the reader apprehend the manner in which
I employ words to express thought; for it is proper to guard against
all obscurity and indefinite and imaginative thoughts.  Know, then,
that I use the terms "essence," " spirit," " soul," and "' interior being," as synonymnous-signifying the form which animates the body,
which body is of it an outward expression.  I use the terms " spiritual," " celestial," and "heavenly," as representing distinct deegrees,
of material refinement.  I employ language in a relative sense, thoughl,
I intend every expression to be understood in its absolute sense, being,
relative only in reference to the whole System of the Universe, of
which this philosophy is intended to be a tangible, verbal expression;
In using the terms "spirit" and "soul," I am adapting myself to theo
forms of expression imposed on philosophy by speculative minds in
order to convey their ideas.
I would, moreover, have all understand that I consider (because'
I perceive) that all things, whether tangible or intangible, are material; that there exists no such thing as "immaterial" or " imponderable" elements, gases, or pervading mediums; and that there.

hereafter be spoken of as collateral with the general descriptions. I
shall employ the terms "' man" and "form" throughout all the forthcorning relations, in order that there may not exist any confusion in
terms; and these I shall use synonymously.
I now perceive the objections that will be raised against the precoding relations, and those which are to follow.  The first of these is
embodied in the question, " What proof have we that this account
of the spirit-world is true?"  I perceive the answer: and that is,
Recognise the unchangeable tendency of the universal laws and
principles that govern the whole System  Of creation; and by them
and their unvarying teachings the mind may decide upon the truth
or falsity of all assertions beyond the possibility of sensuous demonstration.  If they are recognised as immutable, then a sameness in
their tendency must be manifested in all parts of the general structure,of the Universe; and all philosophy that is truthful must correspond
thereunto.  If they proclaim  universal association, then the same
principle should be considered as holding alike in every department.of Nature and the Univerccelum. If they proclaim?universal development, then the same must inevitably be perpetuated from the lowest
point of time to the highest point in eternity.  Upon these universal
and eternal principles of progression, rests the truth of that which
will hereafter be asserted. —-And that which has been asserted will, in,the main, receive the approbation of the most enlightened judgments,
land is analogically demonstrated in the visible fields of creation.
The second objection is, " That it is impious, presumptuous, and
inconsistent with the nature of things, for any being to pretend to
a knowledge of heavenly things. Therefore what is said, must be an
ingenious invention, or a systematized fabrication of unreal and chimerical things."  This objection flows only from a misdirected and
~uneducated judgment, and therefore requires the most unbounded
forgiveness: for it is plain that no enlightened mind would make an
<objection based upon such a mere superficial presumption. The evidence that it is not a fanciful and ingenious invention is contained in
the exterior form of the work, and the irrespective presentation of
truth, without courting the prejudices or beliefs that at present prevail in the world. And that it is not imaginary, evidence may be deirived from the order of the whole revelation, and from the naturalness
of the expressions, of the applications, and of the conclusions, which
tre irresistible to the higher perceptions of any expanded intellect





## p. 643 (#671) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.'43
The third objection is the most powerful of them all, and is to be
feared more than any other enemy, however formidable, that will be
arrayed against the truth —and that is, " I do tzot believe it."   This,
certainly, is an objection which no argument or reason can reach,
because it flows from the depths of ignorance. And to such objectors I would only say, Abandon all such insignificant expressions,
or your ignorance will become imbecility; and press onward to
attain that degree of knowledge that will enable you to understand
whether these things are true or chimerical.
I hereafter employ no arguments to prove the things which I
relate; but I shall be prompted to employ illustrations to make the
relations intelligible to  the mind in its present plane of thought.
With  these remarks, then, I am  prepared to venture the assertion
of truths hereafter without fear as to their rightful apprehension.  I
will now, therefore, ascend to the second world of human existence.
Meanwhile, I shall recognise the truthfulness of the saying, that'Light and Life are Love, and Order and Form  are Wisdom;"
that man internally, is constituted of the " Wisdom  of Love;"' and
that he is the ultimate design of Nature, of the Universe, and of its
Eternal Cause.*
192. Thoughts that are associated with the process of dying, and
with the slate of death,,are to some minds dark, doubtful, cheerless,
* After having been in the abnormal state for upward of four hours, and closing
his lecture at this place, the author remarked, that he perceived on the mind of one
of the witnesses present (Mr. Theron R. Lapham) a desire that he should examine
his wife, who was ill (a fact which had not been previously stated)!. He accordingly
passed off, and on returning to outward consciousness he remarked, that it was very
singular that all the inflowings of those exalted truths of which he had been speaking had now entirely ceased, and that his perceptions of them now were but little more
expansive than they would be if he were in the normal state! This we understood
him to attribute to the fact that the spiritual light governed by the associated minds
of the second sphere had now ceased to shine upon his understanding to the same
degree as while lecturing. He said his mind then rested on altogether a lower plane
of thought, and that he was at that moment only qualified for the examination and
treatment of the diseased. He then proceeded with the examination of the patient
(who was absent), and to give a prescription, the results of which, it is scarcely
necessary to say, were precisely accordant with facts, and attended with the relief
sought by the patient.

add disconsolating; while to others death seems a welcome state,
productive of peace, quietness, blessing, and elevation. It is in a
degree terrifying to all, and to many it seems of all things the most
to be dreaded and shunned. It is generally feared by the brave and
the timid, the wise and the foolish, the old and the young.  It is to
all a fearful process, rendered much more so by the prospect of a
cold and unrelenting grave!  This, I perceive, is in consequence
of wrongly apprehending the process of dying, and of not knowing
the ineffable beauties that surround the living man when it escapes
the outer form.
As soon as the human organization is perfected in its form, size,
and general developments, and as soon as the period has arrived
when the spirit exercises its full control over the body, the process
of transformation commences.  The change is imperceptible, yet it
is incessant and progressive.  The body is not dying for a few
hours only, but for many years-during which time the faculties and
powers of the inner being gradually release their proprietorship over
the form, and the soul continues its aspirations toward the higher
spheres.
When the form is yet a child, it manifests all the angular, eccentric, and irregular traits of character, inclinations, and movements.
When childhood advances to youth, the eccentricity gives way to
more uniformity, and then is displayed the circular, in every possible modification of that form.  When youth ascends to manhood,
the perfect circular and spiral make their appearance, and are uniformly displayed in the inclinations and characteristics of that progressed stage of development. At this period the process of dying
or transformation commences.  The spirit is continually developing
and expanding its faculties, and putting them forth asf elers into the
higher spheres.  The tendencies of the spirit are no more descending, but ascending, and that, too, to an immensity beyond the power
of language to express, or the niost exalted intellect to comprehend.
And as manhood progresses to old age, the body gradually becomes incapable of performing the office required by the spirit.
Hence, when people are aged, their faculties seem buried beneath
the wornout and useless materials of the body. They appear weak
in intellect, imbecile, and unconsociable to all around them that is
youthful, blooming, and seemingly perfected. One faculty after another withdraws from the material form, and their energy, brilliancy,
and susceptibility, seem to decline. The body, finally, is almost

disconnected from the spirit which gives it animation; and then the
body is a dweller in the rudimental sphere, and the spirit is an inhabitant of the inner life, or the spiritual world.  And when the moment of dissolution occurs, the sensation, or clothing medium of the
body, is attracted and absorbed by the spirit, of which it then becomes the material form. At this instant the body manifests faint
and almost imperceptible movements, as if it were grasping for the
life which had fled; and these are contortions of the countenance,
spasmodic contractions of the muscles, and seeming efforts of the
whole frame to regain its animating soul.
Such are the visible appearances connected with the process of
death.  But these are deceptive: for the process occurring in the
interior is far more beautiful than it is possible to describe.  When
the body contracts its muscles and apparently manifests the most
agonizing and writhing efforts, it is merely an open indication of joy
unspeakable in the inner being, and of ecstasy unknown to all but
itself. When the countenance is contorted, pain is not experienced;
but such is an expression of ineffable delight.  And when the body
gives forth its last possession, a smile is impressed on the countenance, which of itself is an index of the brightness and resplendent
beauty that pervade the spirit's home! In the last moments of outer
life the spiritual perceptions are greatly expanded and illuminated,
and the spirit is thus rendered competent to behold the immense possessions of its second habitation.
It is given me to know these truths by daily experiencing them,
and having them verified in the frequent transitions that occur within
my being, from the outer to the inner world, or from the lower to
the higher spheres.  I speak, therefore, from  personal experience,
which is knowledge fully confirmed by the unvarying sensations and
phenomena that occur.
The butterfly escapes its gross and rudimental body, and wings
its way to the sunny bower, and is sensible of its new existence.
The drop of water that reposes on the earth is rendered invisible by
the absorbing invitations of the sun, and ascends to associate with,
and repose in, the bosom of the atmosphere. The day that is known
by its warmth and illumination, dispenses its blessings to the forms
of earth, and sinks into repose in the bosom of the night. Night is,
then, an index of a new day, which is first cradled in the horizon
and afterward perfected in its noontide light, beauty, and animation.
The flower, being unfolded firom the interior by virtue of its own

essence and the sun, is variegated in every possible manner, and thus
becomes a representative of light and beauty; but having attained its
perfection, it soon begins to change its form, its color, and its beauty
of external being.  Its fragrance goes forth and pervades all congenial
and suitable forms, and its beauty is indelibly impressed upon the
memory of its beholder and admirer, when the flower itself is no
more.  The foliage, tinted with the breath of winter, no longer retains its outward beauty: but this is an index of new life and animation, which is perfectly exemplified in the return of foliage in the
youthful season. As it is with these, so it is with the spirit. The
body dies on the outer, or rather changes its mode of existence,
while the spirit ascends to a higher habitation, suited to its nature and
requirements.  And as it is with these, so it is with me, and the
transitions which I continually experience.
The transition of my being from the outer to the inner world is
produced by the action of forces contained in another body, upon
the similar forces contained in my own material form. The process
is that of destroying the sensation of the outer, or rather of changing
it to the sensation of the spirit-at which-time the medium that connects my body with another is sustained by a mingling of the forces
of the two bodies, while the actual sensation leaves the body and be-'
comes the Form of my spirit.  This Form, then, is the body which
I possess while occupying higher positions in material existence.
Inasmuch, then, as the body is thus deserted, I am enabled, by
causes unrelated, to behold the possessions of the Second Sphere,
and to commune with the knowledge there existing, together with
that of earth.  This elevation assists me to penetrate with spiritual
perception the whole arcana of the various earths in the Universe.
Thus I am constantly experiencing a transition from  the outer to
the inner sphere of thought, existence, and investigation.  This
change will be experienced by all, though the means by which it will
be accomplished may seem in some instances painful, terrifying, and
disconsolating.  Death, or the transition so termed, is, however, of
all things the most to be admired, and its prospect is the first thing
to be cherished and appreciated.
In these relations the inhabitants of the earth may repose confidence; and they should meanwhile strive to have all the faculties and
powers of the spirit so developed as to be able to perceive and appreciate the grandeur of that superior existence to which all must:inevitably ascend

~ 193. I now behold the forms of earth and the bodies of men,
including my own, in a light and with a degree of perception never
before presented.  I discover that I can only see the forms by judging what and where they are, by the light of the spirit: for the outer
body is beyond my perception, and I only see well-constituted and
living spirits.  By possessing this perception, I am enabled to commune with all the possessions of this Second Sphere, and now behold the extended fields and living habitations of this elevated existence.
There are to be observed three specific degrees of form and development: the young and unmatured; the advanced stages of these
up to the mediatorial degree of manhood; and the highest of them
all, which is the perfect form and most highly developed of all the
spirits there existing.
I perceive that whenever an infa, nt dies on any of the earths, the
germ or undeveloped body of its spirit becomes deposited in this
Sphere, and is fully unfolded in intellect, and highly enlightened concerning all of its own existence and prior situation.  The iniant that
has had life, and dies in infancy, is, I perceive, in this Sphere, fully
developed and perfected. So it is with all uninformed spirits who
escape the body on any earth: for each is here educated in the truths
and beauties of the whole existence.  So it is also with the intelligent
and highly cultivated; for they are here more advanced, and occupy
a position more elevated and refined.
Moreover, I discover three distinct societies or associations of men
and females, each occupying a position determined by their degree
of cultivation, sympathy for one another, and power of approaching
each other's sphere of knowledge and attainment. And what is well
to relate is, that each society is encompassed by a peculiar sphere or
atmosphere, which is an exhalation from the specific quality of their
interior or spiritual characters.  Every spirit has a peculiar sphere of
its own, and also a general one in which it can with pleasure exist.
And spirits know and associate with each other according to the
quality of the sphere which is exhaled fiomn their interiors.  They
associate only as spheres are agreeable, and as they are capable of
approaching each other with pleasure.
So it is also with mankind on earth. -They dwell in each other's
society only as they can coalesce, and approach each other with
pleasure.  So also are existing on earth the three specific degrees of
development, which are youth, manlhood, and mature age.  But they

648            NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS,
are in a rudimental condition, and not situated in order as they are
in the Second Sphere.
I perceive that spirits approach each other according to the relative degrees of brilliancy which surrounds and encompasses their
forms. Thus association is determined and made perfect by the law
of congeniality and affinity, or affection. They have an affection for
one another in proportion to the similarity in the degrees of love and
purity to which they have attained.  Thus are the three states or
societies established.
In thefirst society are an immense number of infant and uncultivated spirits, which are in various degrees of advancement and cultivation, according as such have proceeded fiom the earth. In the second
group or society, are those who have become highly instructed itn the
principles and truths of the Divine Mind.  And into this society all
who die on earth with minds properly unfolded, are immerse(l, because here they can associate agreeably.  In the third society I
discover spirits of the most enlightened character.  The miost of
them proceed from the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and also firom
planets in other solar systems.  This society is so highly illumninated with wisdom, that it is almost impossible for the spirits of the
lower societies to approach it.  If they make an effort to enter their
midst, this is immediately overcome by the strong repulsion arising
froin the non-affinity existing between them  and their respective
spheres.
The atmosphere that flows fromi and encompasses and protects the
first society, is of a mingled and rather unilluminated appearance.
Its brilliancy is rather faint in comparison to that of those above it.
It appears gloomy, dark, and rather uncongenial, because it is an
emanation from uncultivated intellects.  Yet there is a puriy —an
exceeding purity among them, viewed comparatively with that existing on earth.
The second society is enveloped with an atmosphere of far more
congenial variegations, presenting a resplendent brilliancy which indicates purity and elevation.  It appears like the mingling of many
colors, such as are not known on earth. And these are all so perfectly conjoined, and are blended together in such harmony, that the
whole arom(a is of itself a representation of purity and refinement.
Yet it is a spnere emanating from the whole body of the society, indicating the wisdom of the spirits composing it.  Their wisdom consists in a knowledge of truths and principles concerning material and





## p. 649 (#677) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 6:49
rudimental things; and in them  they are highly enlightened.  And
the inconceivable variety of colors surrounding them arises from their
dissimilar stages of intellectual advancement. Yet they are all in the
same plane of wisdom, and thus form one society, enveloped by this
beautiful and refined atmosphere.
The third society is also clothed with an aerial garment, which
is a perfect representation of the character and perfection of their interiors. I behold in it all colors, and a variety of reflections proceeding from the subordinate societies; and these reflections render their
spiritual emanation so very beautiful that language is inadequate to
describe it.
Those of the first society are in the plane of natural thought; that
is, they are just emerging firom the instructions and impressions of
earth, into the wisdom of the higher societies.
The second society is in the plane or sphere of causes; that is,
they are just emerging firom a superior knowledge of visible effects
presented on earth, to a perception of the interior causes of them:
and their wisdom extends to the lowest and first cause of all material
things.  Therefore they have a knowledge of all interior causes, essences, and their modes of external manifestation:  but they are not
in the possession of superior wisdom concerning the uses for which
causes and effects were instituted.
The third society is in the plane of effects; and those composing
it have a perception of all ultimate design, and of the universal
adaptation of things to each other.  Their minds are exceedingly
luminous.  With their powers of penetration, the externals of things
are laid open, and they perceive only the character and quality of
the interior. Their vision extends to every recess of their own habitation, and their knowledge comprehends all subordinate material
existences.  They have a most unlimited presentation of all created
things below their elevated position; and their wisdom is light, and
love, and brilliancy, and even ecstasy, to a degree that transcends,
description. With their unfolded spiritual powers, they behold the
vast landscapes of the spirit-home, too extensive to be comprehended
by men on earth, and too beautiful to be appreciated or enjoyed by
them.
The third society are not only in a state of emergement from the
plane of causes to tha.t of effects, but also from their sphere to the
third world of human existence.

~ 194. And what is.well to relate is, that notwithstanding the dissimilitude that exists between the three societies, there is a perfect
unity among them, and a mutual dependence one upon another; and
there is a continual aspiring affection that gyrates from the infant intellect to the high and superior wisdom of the third society.  There
is a unity of action, an agreeableness of situation, and a propriety of
position, which cause them  all to live for one another, like a brotherh ood.
And, moreover, it is profitable to remark that each society or group
is well situated, well conditioned, and well cultivated, in reference to
the specific state which each is compelled to sustain.  The situations
are perfect in proportion to the degree of wisdom and refinement to
which each has attained.  The lowest appears inferior in comparison
to the higher and superior; though even the first, to man on earth.
would appear to be a high state of perfection.  By the varieties of
condition and development, the societies are made perfect.  They
are thus as one brotherhood, joined by mutual affections and actions,
and perpetuated in goodness by the benign and gentle influences that
proceed from the highest society to the lower ones, and firom these
to it again.
The societies in the Second Sphere are very much to be admired,
because of the perfect harmony which pervades them, and the perfect melody and concert of rudimental and perfected knowledge
which they manifest. In a corresponding manner does there exist a
concert of, action, a unity of feeling, and a universal love, one for
another.
The inhabitants do not converse vocally, but immerse their thoughts
into one another by radiating them upon the countenance.  And I
perceive that thought enters the spirit by a process of brcathing, or
rather it is introduced by influx according to the desires of those conversing.  They perceive thought by and through the eyes, inasmuch
as these, like the general countenance, are an index to the quality and
workings of the interior.  They seemingly hear each other converse;
but that is owing to a previous knowledge of sound by which words
are distinguished and their meaning apprehended.
They perceive things without them by their sense of vision; but
they are conscious that it is the reflection which they perceive, and
not the substance.  Therefore they exercise j'udgment concerning all
they perceive —not judging from sensuous observation, but from the
character of the substance observed





## p. 651 (#679) ############################################


NATURErS DIVINE REVELATIONS.               -651
I also discover that spirits in this Sphere approach and associate
with each other according to the mutual affinity subsisting between
them, even as do the inhabitants of earth; but the difference is in the
mode of associating.  Men on earth associate with one another by
the guidance of their gross and rudimental senses, as these are productive of inclination and desire.  Instead of this, men associate in
this higher Sphere by a knowledge of each other's inherent purity,
and the state of each other's affections.
Moreover, I perceive that the former experience of every person,
both male and female, is treasured up in the memory, from which
they can extract representations of that which they previously knew
or experienced.  Everything appears indelibly impressed upon the
memory, and is mirrored forth with a vividness in proportion to the
strength of the impression.  Therefore whatever thought enters the
human mind on earth, becomes a resident in the memory, and is
here brought forth with the appearance of newness that makes it both
interesting and instructive.  Those things experienced which are
disagreeable to the memory, are deposited in its depths and concealed from thle view of any other being, by the prevalence of those
events and experiences which it pleases the mind to remember, and
which the mind takes delight in contemplating.  Hence it is proper
for all men on earth to do and think only that which pleases them
most (according to wisdom), and which they would most earnestly
desire to remember; and not to do those things, or encourage those
thoughts, which are opposed to the superior delights of the mind.
If this can not be done in the present social and mental condition of
the world, then it is proper to change those conditions, so that even
this great good and pleasure may be obtained.
When spirits conversing appeal to each other's memory, the memory mirrors forth a perfect representation of the thing remembered,
which is perceived and understood by the conversing spirit.  I behold beautiful representations in the memory of those in the higher
societies.  These representations are of the most exquisite character, because they proceed firom the memory of highly-enlightened
intellects; and they are therefore delightful, inviting, and instructive.
I perceive that everything in this Sphere is created and manifested
only by and through the exercis'e and direction of Wisdom. Hence
the perfect order and uniformity that subsist, and the inexpressible
happiness that flows as a consequence from such exquisite harmony
and unity of action. Everything is appreciated as a blessing con,

ferred upon them by the light and life of Divine Love, and the ordet
and form of Divine Wisdom.
It is pleasing to behold these heavenly societies: for I see them at
this moment existing in the most perfect degree of brotherly love,
and joined inseparably together by constant ascending and descending affections.  How very clear and bright are their countenances
and expressions!  They are unblemished by artificiality, and unspotted by rudimental and gross intrusions-for they are above and
superior to these, and highly developed.  The first society is indeed
low in comparison to the highest; but the variety and the degrees
nevertheless form of the whole a complete brotherhood. The diversity consists in the different degrees of development; and the lowest
can not approach the highest, because of the dissimilarity of quality
and spheres.  But the lowest contains and involves the highest,
while the latter in return comprehends and pervades the whole
Sphere, manifesting a grace and beauty beyond the power of language
to describe.  And there exists almost an infinite variety of dispositions, of loves, of affections, and of wisdom, among them; yet each
modification of previous conditions of mind is only an ascending degree of refinement toward perfection.
The whole is beautiful-surpassingly beautiful and sublime!-for
there exists that continual emanation of love and wisdom from societies and individual forms, displaying a brilliancy of illumination beyond any light or color on earth. It is even so very bright and
beautiful that those in the lower societies who approach are almost
thrown into ecstasies of delight.  They become prostrated, and apparently fall on their faces, because of the beauty and brilliancy
of the aroma that encompasses the superior societies of the spirithome.
Thus it is that all preserve an order in their lives and situations;
and thus it is that their approach to each other is graduated according to the unfolding of the spiritual senses and faculties to the external.  They represent the circular and spiral forms; for there exists
among them a uniform and also an ascending movement. And one
is continually unfolding the possessions of another, even as from the
germ are unfolded the body and the flower. And even as the flower
perpetuates the species of the plant, so does the superior society pervade the lower ones, and is constantly introducing them into its own
vast possessions; and thus all go onward to a still higher Sphere of
spiritual and intellectual elevation.

~ 195. I now proceed to relate the external beauties that appertain
to this Second Sphere of human existence. For it is necessary that
the whole aspect of the spirit-home should be vividly represented to the
inhabitants of the earth, so that it may be an inducement for them to
advance in their social and spiritual condition.
I behold the spiritual Sphere as containing all the beauties of the
natural Sphere combined and perfected.  And in every natural
Sphere these beauties are represented, though in the first and rudimental degree; so that every earth is of itself an index and an introduction to the beauty and grandeur that are existing in the Second
Sphere.  For from  the natural the spiritual is unfolded, or made
manifest.
The extended surface of this Sphere, I perceive, presents regular
and gentle undulations, which render the whole diversified and exceedingly inviting. And very extensive plains are presented, which
are clothed with great fertility, and with innumerable varieties of forms
such as deck the bosom of the earth when all things are favorable to
a thrifty production. In those vast plains is represented the most
perfect order.  They are gardens, typical of purity, unity, and celestial love. Their diversified paths continually lead to new and instructive portions, all of which are useful as displaying Divine Love
and Wisdom, which generate unity and affinity in all created things.
All flowers, and even their leaves, are observed as so many voices
proclaiming the beauty of interior perfection, and the infinite Source
from which they sprang. Every plant, flower, bird, and tree, is perceived and appreciated as the express creation of Divine love and
Divine action.
And there is a beauty in the external of each created thing, which
is of itself an open expression of celestial love and wisdom.  The
flowers and foliage are of the most variegated appearance; and their
variety renders them instructive and impressive, insomuch that they
act as enchantments upon the minds of those who behold them, and
induce thoughts beautiful, elevating, and edifying.  A fragrance perpetually ascends from those vast plains of creation, giving life and
brilliancy to the atmosphere, which is thereby rendered suitable to be
inhaled as the breath of love and exhaled as the thoughts of wisdom.
Every created thing possesses within itself a living love and affection;
and this is communicated from one thing to another, all things thus
becoming as it were electrified and illuminated. The beauty of one
flower is imparted to another, which in its turn communicates an equal

654            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
bestowment upon others. And thus those plains are a living repre,
sentation of Divine Love and Wisdom.
There exists among the many inviting things of this Sphere a peculiar blending of inherent affections that different forms possess.
This remark applies to all things in the spiritual Spheres.  The beginning and ending of things appear not; but their actual existence
is made manifest with all their living beauties.
Wisdom here existing consists not in words, nor in the depths of
the mnemory; but in the actual manifestation that everything vividly
displays. In other words, instruction and admonition are not derived
from speech, but firom  action and representation.  And everything
here is profitable and practical-nothing is useless or imaginative.
Those of thefirst society dwell much in the delights of these plains
and their variegated foliage, fiom a sense and susceptibility of love,
but not with an appreciation of wisdom: and they are thereby instructed, developed, and rendered pure. Herein is displayed a perlect adaptation; for while they are irresistibly drawn to the beauties
thus presented, those beauties in return breathe into them the breath
of living love, enkindling the flame of perfect wisdom, which then
burns to purity. All things are adapted to the necessities of man;
and this they feel, both from an inherent consciousness, and also
fiom a living desire to become instructed in the ways of goodness,
which are those paths that lead throughout the many portions of this
Sphere.
Those of the second society enjoy very much the unity displayed
among those of the first group, and also the delights courted by the
first.  Besides this, they are continually investigating, analyzing, exploring, and cultivating, those many things which are within their
sphere of comprehension, and thus producing living evidences of
their wisdom and. united ingenuity.
Those of the third society are to the rest ministering angels, directing spirits, and perfect examples of exalted wisdom.  By their
knowledge the lower societies, and even the spiritual possessions of
the whole Sphere, are illuminated and. made bright, beautiful, and
enchanting.
There are also flowing through these gardens rivers of clear and
placid waters; and even in these are exemplified the ceaseless flowings of Love and Wisdom, that are breathed, not only into heaven,
but into the Universe, and become the light and life of all created
things..  The Love of each society, like the still water agitated by a

NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 655
falling pebble, expands and waves throughout all the lower and higher
spheres until the wave has almost reached the bounds of space, which
is then filled with love. There is no limiting the extension of the
wave of water, nor can the unfoldings of love be circumscribed. And
as the waters will roll gently against the shore, so Love flows forth
and unfolds itself until it becomes merged into Wisdom, which then
is rendered surpassingly beautiful, because Love is its creative souI
and living principle.
Those rivers are representations of Divine creation.  They also
represent Life: for as the river flows fromn the rill, so Life flows from
the germ that is deposited deep in the interior of the Universe; and
as the rill flows into and becomes an immense ocean, so Life flows
into and becomes the animating soul of all things.  These rivers are
so very clear and translucent, that the brilliancy of the azure heavens
is in them vividly reflected. And as night makes the stars appear,
so do these waters represent the whole celestial scenery above them.
These rivers flow through valleys abounding in the most beautiful
and varied creations, and in every species of variegated foliage that
also adorns those vast plains; and the whole presents the Inost exalted representation of life and WTisdom.
I behold, also, groves that are of the most charming and enchanting character. It is impossible to behold them without being impressed with new and beautiful thoughts, such as they naturally
suggest.  In these groves are reposing those who investigate and
who love wisdom  and the Divine Mind supremely.  And those
that are in the first society, or in Love only, court the refreshing
shades of those groves, and learn with docility and yet with dignity,
of the beauties that are around and above them, and are instructed by
these beauties' expounders.
~ 196. I perceive that all spirits are engaged in loving their neighbors, and advancing their welfare; and here is good will without distinction. I perceive that spirits are engaged in exploring the fields of
Thought, and searching deeply into the causes of things; and thus
they learn of love and accumulate wisdom.  And there is no inertia,
no stagnation, but activity and industry are visible in every department of this heavenly Sphere. And it is well to relate that every
one is engaged in that for which he has an affection, and there is,
therefore, no confusion. Nor are there any disqualifying conditions,
but every one is qualified to labor in that for which he has an affec




## p. 656 (#684) ############################################


6#56           NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
tion. Affections are varied according to the degrees to which each
spirit from the first to the highest society, has advanced in the stages
of development. Hence industry is equal, useful, harmonious, and
reciprocal; for every one gravitates to the situation which accords
with his predisposing desire.
Moreover, I behold here some of the most magnificent creations
of Will and Wisdom. It is well to remark, that everything created
in this sphere is suggested by Love and perfected by Wisdom -and
is, therefore, a living projection firom their minds.  Things are created by Will; and these I discover are distributed in a uniform manner throughout the plains, valleys, rivers, and groves of the spirithome.  I discover constructions of the most grand and magnificent
character, each having a brilliancy and illumination according to the
advanced state of the society in which it is found.  The first society
have creations which are representations of their Love, and Will,
and uncultivated Wisdom; and these they behold as representations
of their interior thoughts.  The creations of the second society display more uniformity, order, and usefulness; and thus they subserve
the purposes of the first society and themselves.  The third society
have splendid constructions, too vast and elegant to describe, and the
most ambitious imagination could not transcend them in its conceptions.  For they are in reality too perfect and too magnificent to be
conceived of by any mind in its rudimental state of being.
And there exists among them a pervading happiness; a soothing
and tranquillizing element of forgiveness and universal love; a cordiality in the bestowment of inherent love upon each other, and a mingling, and yet perfect harmony, of thoughts, all of which it is delightful
to contemplate.  These manifestations all proclaim the divinity of
the life and love that flow into and animate all the heavens.
The waftings of thought firom one mind to another, are such as
can be felt, and yet no spirit receives thought uncongenial with its
quality and being.  These waftings are breaths that are inhaled by
unfolded spirits willing to receive them.  It appears as if thoughts
were continually descending into the recesses of less advanced spiritual existence, and also ascending through all the higher Spheres
even to the highest, which is the seat and Throne of the Divine
Mind.
There are truths here known of the most novel and mysterious
character; but these I am not permitted to relate at this time; for
they are unimportant to the human race.  Yet there is a class of





## p. 657 (#685) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                   607
truths which it is profitable to mention-and these are concerning
the experiences, opinions, and beliefs, that exist among the inhabitants of this spiritual Sphere.
I perceive that when infants are introduced from the human races
into the first society, they are believed to be born among them: for
appearances to them'are the same as to families in the human race.
After the infant is ushered into their midst, they behold and admire
it; -for it teaches tenderness, kindness, and immaculate purity.  Infants, therefore, are caressed, nourished, guided, and admonished by
them, according to the high degree of love and wisdom that exists
among the various societies.  The infant is beheld as constituted
only of love, and as possessing inherent qualities that will unfold and
lead to perfection. -Their whole,object is to produce a proper development of the germinal qualities contained in love; and this they
do by processes of the most simple and gentle character.
And so it is also with spirits from the human race that are imperfectly developed while in the human body, and with such as have
had their faculties and spiritual principles misdirected, obstructed, or
disconcerted.  Thus, I perceive that imbecile persons, especially it
they have become so by accident or disease, are received into this
Sphere as infaint spirits, and  are  then  unfolded  and rendered
beautiful.
I moreover perceive that those who are interiorly deformed from,
birth, have no identity, or even birth in the higher Sphere.  And so
it is with all unorganized bodies; for such are not capable of developing the qualities and faculties of the spirit, and hence- do not pre —
serve their identity.
Spirits from  the human -race who have been from birth dejected,
and disconsolated, and who have suffered trials and afflictions of the,
most severe character, are received to the bosom of the first, or sec —
ond, or third society, with exceeding great joy —so great is thefondness of love for them, and the desire to make them happy..
They are received to the bosom  of their affection, and to the lifeof their love, as the mother receives and embraces her child.  Theyare cherished and loved with all the combined affection that dwells:
in the depths of each spirit. How joyful it is to see those welcomes,.
and those soothing and tranquillizing affections breathed into that,
spirit who has suffered trials and afflictions in the human race!
The quality of a spirit is at once perceived, and what is better'
than all, is, the dwellers in this sphere j(udge not by external or st-. 
42

658            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
perficial manifestations, such as passions or impulses of the soul, but
by the quality and advanced state of the spirit itself; and it is according to this that they love the spirit introduced into their midst.  Yet
the strength of their love is in proportion to the capability of the introduced spirit to appreciate and enjoy it. Love is not bestowed too
abundantly, nor is any privilege granted which is not useful; but
everything of this nature is graduated according to capabilities. Thus
it is that "to whom much is given, of him is much required."  This
is a truth which angels know; and these are the words of superior
wisdom.
And what may appear strange is, that often when a spirit leaves the
human form, and is introduced into this Sphere, it for a moment can
not realize the change, for it is imperceptible.  Spirits retain the
same bodily form in the spiritual Sphere; and at first they feel as if
they were only transferred to a country they knew not.  It is, however, not long after the transition before their interior senses are
opened; and then they behold and appreciate the change, and the
beauties with which they are surrounded.  And some spirits appear
to wonder that. they did not see it before, and that they did not
believe it while in the body; for now it appears so tangible, and so
perfectly agreeable with the universal teachings of natural law.
Men who have been impressed on earth with certain doctrines,concerning the other life, seem to smile at themselves, and marvel
because they were so misled, and so easy to be misdirected.  Some
who have believed in the literal resurrection of the material body, are
so ashamed of this conviction that they strive to hide their memory
of it from the perception of others.  And some strive to modify their
previous beliefs so as to make them harmonize with what they now
experience and know to be true.  And such is the ease with those
who have imbibed gross doctrines while on earth, and which are still
impressed upon their memory; for immediately after the transition,
they recognise the falsity of their previous convictions, and for a little
while strive to conceal and modify them.  This desire, I discover,
continues only for a little season; for being penetrated by the perceptions of others with ease, they are led to discard with pleasure the
impressions of the memory, and their hereditary affection for doctrines; and they then become enlightened by the light and love of
heaven, and begin their ascending progress toward the higher socie.
ties of their new home.

~ 197. Thefirst society is in Love, the second is in Will, and the
third is in W/isdom.  These societies are composed of families,
groups, and associations.  And these live in an harmonious manner
one with another, displaying perfect order, form, and series of development and position. And all are thus as ONE BROTHERHOOD.
Even one of these societies is composed of more individuals than
are existing upon all the planets in the solar system, and even upon
all the earths belonging to the fifth Circle of Suns.  Their numbers
transcend computation.  And I discover that the first Sphere of
spiritual existence is unfolded from the last Sphere of material creation, which is the Circle of Suns above referred to. It appears now
a little strange to me that men have not conceived this truth before.
But when man is in the human body, with his material senses opened,
he perceives material things, because he is animated from the inner
to the outer world: but when he escapes the body, at death, though
the form is not changed, nor any of its qualities or properties, yet instead of seeing with his material he perceives with his spiritual
senses; and the spirit-world is unfolded to hi's view.  The transition
is imperceptible.
I discover that most of the inhabitants of Mercury, Venus, the
Earth, and Mars, are dwelling in the first society of the Second
Sphere; and that these of the other planets occupy higher positions
in the plane of thought and wisdom.
And a holy quietness pervades the whole spirit-world.  There is
happiness of the most inexpressible character-and ecstasies, and
exultations, and glorifications, are continually ascending.  There is
so much purity and holiness that my mind is scarcely capable of
withstanding its moving influence, such as would instantly annihilate
all speech.  Yet I have now a strength which I have not before
known.  I can receive the inflowings of these truths, and behold
these holy and celestial beauties, without becoming disconcerted or
incapable of declaration.
They have a sense of music: but it proceeds not from hcearing, for
they plerceive harmony, and the soul of harmony, which is music.
Such floats along the strata of the atmosphere, and is wafted into the
soul as the fragrance of a flower into the senses.  I do not hear but
see music.  I see it in the united voices of flowers, that speak, yet
make no sound-in the shrubbery and foliage that proclaim truths,
yet speak not —and in the harmony of each heavenly society: for
that harmony is heavenly music. Music is perceived by the unfold




## p. 660 (#688) ############################################


660            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
ed senses, and appreciated by the Wisdom. It is the soul of order,
the creator of all celestial harmony and melody. The music thus
perceived sinks into the depths of the soul, and unfolds sentiments
of which the spirit-home alone is worthy.  There is not a labyrinth
or avenue of the spirit-land that is not penetrated by the vibrations
and silent echoings of this heavenly harmony.  There is not a
thought concealed in the soul which is not quickened into life and
awakened into the act of glorification thereby.  There is not a recess
in the material or spiritual Universe that is not quickened with life
and illuminated with light, even Divine Love; and wherever this exists, music flows and is congenial. Hence everything loves and appreciates music; and this is perfected only in the Second Sphere.
There is a translucent beauty, and glory, and holiness, and happiness, that pervade and quicken into life the spirit-home, that defy all
verbal expression.  There is such a specificness manifested in all
things, and yet such an inseparable unity and brotherly love, as can
not be described, but is to be known only when experienced.  It is
impossible to portray the delights, the ecstasies, and the enchantments, which flow into the mind as it is immersed into this beautiful
Sphere of spiritual existence.
I can read firom  the memory of any spirit, either in the human
form or in this spiritual Sphere, with as much ease as one can read
from a book. I can converse with the spirits distinctly, and learn
from them the peculiar impressions and affections of their souls; and
this I can communicate to any person in the human form. But
this I am not permitted to do at all times, inasmuch as it would be
revealing that which the human race should not know.
One more important truth it is well to relate; and that is, that
those who form a mutual attachment while on earth, which is pure
and true, continue to preserve an affection for one another throughout the spiritual Spheres. If the attachment is pure, it will be their
conjugal affection, of the highest degree of refinement.  And if one
leaves the form before the other, this will make no difference: for
when they are both out of the form, they recognise each other in the
same manner as friends do in the human race.  And if one has progressed further than the other, the one possessing wisdom will pervade and cultivate the love of the other, until their natures become
assimnilated, and they become fully suited to associate with one
another. All attachments are of the Love; and all love is modified and perfected by Wisdom. Hence, while all conjugal affection





## p. 661 (#689) ############################################


NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 661
on earth is of the Love, all conjugal affection in heaven is of the
Wisdom, strengthened and quickened into life by the Love which
gave birth to the prior attachment.
And also little children are recognised and loved here as they are
on earth. Parents who love their children while in the form, continue to love them in this Sphere; and their love is here strengthened
by superior wisdom. If a child leave the form while very young,
and the parents when aged, the child must of necessity be far advanced, both in its outward size and its inward developments. But
when the parents are introduced into the same Sphere, they know
their child by a peculiar sense of rudimental love-by a relation of
a constitutional character which they instantly perceive; and they
rush (with wisdom) into each other's embrace.
All are joined according to the purity and realness of their attachment.  Degrees of refinement do not determine the attachment so
much as the quality of the spiritual constitution; and this is according
to a law pervading all material and spiritual thiings.
Such is the Second Sphere of human existence; and such substantially are its truths. The relation between it and the earth, and
all earths, may be perceived by the similitude of external manifestations, these differing only in degrees of purity and development.
And it is proper and advantageous that the human race should know
and appreciate these truths, so that they may be induced to press onward and upward in the ascending scale of progress toward the great
Fount of Love and Happiness.  This is the object of the present
relation, and it can not well fail to perform its office: and when this
is fulfilled, the race will be elevated to a high degree of social and
moral culture, and thus all as one will be holy, happy, and perfect.
198. Inasmuch as on the various'earths there are born several
millions of spirits in one second of time, from which fact there necessarily occur also as many deaths, so an equal number at every second
are being introduced into the spiritual Sphere.  And as there is this
incessant influx from the natural into the spiritual Sphere, so there is
also an equal refluxation from the Second Sphere into the Third,
which is the Celestial Sphere.  Thus the movements that are incessantly and imperceptibly going on, are in number beyond the comprehension of any except that mighty Mind who moved, and they all
sprang into being!
There is, then, an incessant transition fiom the Second to thp





## p. 662 (#690) ############################################


662            NATURES DIVINE REVELATIONS.
Third Sphere; but the darkness incident thereunto is light, and the
death is life inconceivable. Pain is a living index of pleasure, and
love is the first indication of superior wisdom. The highly-cultivated
spirits of the Second Sphere contemplate this transition with delight
that surpasses all human speech. There is no more death to them,
for death is life, and this springs up and blooms in the Sphere above,
iith a brighter beauty and a more lovely wisdom. It is impossible
to describe the sensations of delight which exist in the interior of that
spirit who lies down to repose in the Second Sphere, to be quickened
into newness of life in the first society in the third heavens.  They
experience ecstasies which none but spirits know; and what is more
beautiful than all is, that they govern their delights with the most
transcending wisdom.. They only migrate from the habitation of the
second state, into the more congenial climes of the Sphere above.
"The sting of death" is lost in the pleasures of life and beauty, and
herein is that passage fully verified which speaks of this consummation.*  Such are the views of the spirits in the Second Sphere concerning their flight to higher habitations, which takes place according
to the workings of natural law.
In this Sphere I perceive also three distinct societies, and three
aromas of the most inexpressible brilliancy: and I perceive that they
correspond to perfected Love, to perfected Wisdom, and to celestial
purity.
The first society is composed of those whose last stage of being
was in the third society in the Sphere below.  They have Love,
Will, and Wisdom, combined, and to a degree of perfection that
transcends all human thought.  Their love is so pure that there is a
visible radiation from their countenances, and a halo of purity surrounding them  that possesses inexpressible attractions.  Yea, it is
like the electric fire: for it is instantaneously communicated from one
to another; and thus all send forth smiles of delight, until the whole
society is exceedingly delighted.  It is attractive to behold their perfect Will, or the holy passiveness of that faculty, which is not prompted to an improper act, or to do one thing derogatory to the general
welfare.  And it is more than beautiful to behold their highly-cultivated Wisdom; for it blooms and sends forth a fragrance that no
flower can more than faintly imitate. And this fragrance makes glad
every spirit in heaven.
The second society are still more advanced, insomuch that they' " Death is swallowed up in victory," &c., 1 Cor. xv. 54-57.





## p. 663 (#691) ############################################


NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                663
transcend all human description.  They are so perfectly conjoined
one with another, and their mutual affections are so absorbing and
penetrating, that it requires a high degree of discernment to make S
distinction between them.
And the third society is the highest of the Third Sphere; and they
have celestial purity.  So exceedingly pure are they that every subordinate spirit is repelled with an innate consciousness of non-association.  Their purity gives forth a radiation brighter than the brightest sun.  It is even a light of love, of wisdom, and of celestial purity,
that gives life to every spirit in the lower societies.  They are guardian angels to those below them, to whom they are constantly'descending, with no other end in view than to gratify their thirstings
for purity, and their desires that are holy and celestial.
I perceive here also those plains that are undulated as the gentle
waves of the ocean.  I perceive a celestial fragrance arising from
every flower that blooms in the garden of the living Mind with an
immortal beauty.  I behold those diversified creations; and each one
is as an angel proclaiming immortal truths in the sanctuary of the
)ivine Mind.
It is well to relate that everything has a use and design, to which it
is with promptness applied: and there are thereby ends of the most
inconceivable importance accomplished.  These advance the condition'and quality of each spirit; and each created thing is only a step
to perpetuate infinite progression.  Everything is as an act of the
Divine Mind, and every representation is as a word fitly spoken.
These things are all perceived by their expanded powers. Thus it
is that hearing is transformed into seeing, and seeing is correspondingly elevated, and includes all the' powers of the other senses combined.
I behold also those valleys.  Their termination can not be seen,
and their excellences can not be appreciated, except by those who
dwell among them. Each valley is as a volume whose contents are
sublime beyond conception, and each plain is as an unbounded field
of knowledge.
And I behold also those very placid rivers-whose power of reflection seems only fitted to represent the unspeakable grandeur that
pervades the atmosphere of the celestial heaven.  A holy pensiveness seems to be manifested by those rivers and the atmosphere; and
they seem to welcome and embrace each other.  The still waters
seem to spring up unto everlasting life; and they seem to play and

064            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
sport with the brilliant atmosphere, as if there were a mutual and
lively sympathy between them.
Again, I see those groves-and how they extend to, and line the
surfy margin'of those living rivers: and their roots and foliage are
baptized in them, and purified to the glory of the Infinite Mind.
There is a precision in every form, in every bud, and leaf, and flower, that garland and render beautiful those heavenly groves.  Indeed,
their shade casts a fi'eshness which inspires every living form that reposes therein with vigor and vivacity; and thus are they means employed by the Divine Mind to refine the faculties of his spirit-children,
and prepare them for a home in the highest Spheres.
~ 199. Inasmuch as the knowledge of this Sphere is entirely above
the comprehension of the human race, I am not permitted to dwell
upon it to any extent.  For I perceive that all these relations are
only permitted as a means to elevate the inhabitants of the earth, and
to purify all their spiritual sentiments.  But I now perceive the truth
of a passage in the' Primitive History, by one of the lovely spirits
that dwell in the celestial Sphere, and also its application.  For here
are beauties innumerable, all of which are means employed by Divine Wisdom  to perpetuate infinite progression, and whereby his
spirit-children of all earths and all Spheres may dwell in tle "' Father's house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."  And I
perceive that " in the Father's house there are many mansions," all
of which are illuminated by Divine Love, animated by perfected
spirits, and send forth an expanding brilliancy throughout all space,
which is the order, and form, and soul, of Divine Wisdom.
The inhabitants of the Third Sphere impart knowledge and express love to each other, as the sun imparts life and beauty to the
forms on earth.  And in this Sphere are also imparted a grace, ease,
and elegance, that beautify and sublimate every spirit.
It is charming beyond description to behold the stately palms, and
how they by every mlovement proclaim humiliation —and to see with
what grace they bow their majestic tops to the breaths of divine Wisdom!n  And while spirits are seeking repose under their wide-spread
branches, they learn a lesson of grace, and meekness, and gentleness, which is indestructible.  It is, moreover, enchanting to behold
the fertility, so expressive of divine Love, and to perceive the fiagrance so typical of celestial purity.
Every spirit has an exhalation or bodily atmosphere which is an

exact indication of the quality and purity of its interiors; and thereby
are all distinguished. For spheres are of every possible variety of
color, according to the qualities of the spirits fioin which they ema.
nate. Some have mingled colors, and some have only one. And
it is also given me to know, that every natural earth, and that every
mineral, vegetable, animal, man, and spirit-yea, that every particle
of matter in the universe, has a peculiar sphere, by which it may be
designated and recognised:-also, that every spiritual sphere, firom
the lowest to the highest, has a spherical emanation that describes its
interior.  It is surpassingly delightful to see those aromas and
haloes of purity that surround every spirit.
So true is it that all things have a languagc, that even the spirits
learn as children in a book, from the united voices coming from
everything created.  The whole forms a Volume whose contents are
celestial, and whose philosophy is the Divine Creator's. Every passage which it contains proclaims goodness infinite, and every page
unfolds volumes of immense love. The whole Book is an offspring
of Wisdom. Yea, it was written in the great temple of Truth, and
in the home of many rrnnsions.  The spring, the rill, the stream,
and the river, are introductions to this great Volume.  The groves,
ravines, and forests, are margins that cast a reflection on its contents,
and speak only of harmony and inherent affection.  The valleys,
plains, and beautiful gardens, abounding in all the luxuriant and immense creations of the spirit-home, are the impressed words on the
leaves of this divine Book.  And angels are the recipients of the instruction thereof, through which their interior powers are expanded
to the glory of the Divine Mind for ever and ever.' They drink at
the fount of Wisdom, and walk in the fields and gardens of celestial
Love. They are incessantly employed in imparting blessings to
those who need, and meanwhile they receive in return the smiles
and approbations of a delighted heaven.  Yea, in this the angels
rejoice, and give forth songs of thanksgiving and praise that ascend
through all the Spheres, to be recognised by Him who spake, and
all things became alive!
Such are the combined beauties of the Celestial Sphere: but
what has been said concerning Nature, Man, the Second Sphere, and
the Universe, is as nothing in comparison to that which might be
related concerning this one state of spiritual existence.  WVe have
only as yet entered the vestibule that introduces the mind into the
great Temple of divine Truth, whose foundation is in the depths of





## p. 666 (#694) ############################################


666            NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
the Universe, whose immensity fills all space, and whose aspiring
domes are lost in the heights of infinity! Nay, the heights, and
depths, and lengths, and breadths, thereof, can be known only by
its Maker and Builder, who is the Living Soul of all things.  This
Temple has splendor and gorgeous magnificence that no mind can
conceive or appreciate save that Divine Architect who fills and animates it by the living fire of his own Love, and beautifies it by the
living energies of his own Wisdom!
What has been said concerning the Third Sphere, and all previ
ous ones, is, then, as but one particle compared to that which is, and
shall for ever remain, unrelated.  Expand the Universe to an extent
that will outdo space, and make spheres so numerous as to defy all
computation-and yet there is a Univerccelum  about which not one
word can be spoken, or one thought can be conceived.  If all tht
sublimest thoughts of the inhabitants of the earth were combined,
their magnitude would be naught in comparison to the extent of the
beauty, greatness, and grandeur, of the celestial heaven.  Nay, all
thoughts, save the thoughts of that Being whom these things represent, would be as one atom in comparison to that which is above,
beneath, and around those things of which I have spoken.  The
human race can not conceive of this immensity; but 0! how beautiful, how pure, and how enduring, are these truths!
Yet, the restless mind of man leaves earth and soars off into the
regions of the celestial spheres; it strives to familiarize itself with
all the creations thereof, and brings into its employ all the mathematical skill that can be of service in marking out and mapping out
the structure of the Universe; and while it is striving to comprehend
these things, the thoughts expand to their utmost tension, and doubt
and dread repulse it back to earth.  It finds no resting-place, and
returns to its narrow encasement unsatisfied.  Hence, again, I say,
were all thoughts of this nature that ever have been conceived by
man, combined together, they would not be adequate to a comrnprehension of the grandeur even of the Third Sphere of human existence.
I perceive, then, that we have just entered the vestibule that leads
to apartments too vast and immense to ever be described. Yet I am
permitted to ascend to the FOURTH SPHERE, and observe the comparative perfection that there exists, in reference to that of the subordinate habitations. Thus I ascend to, and am immerged into, the
fourth habitation of the spirits and angels that were once of the
human race.

~ 200. I now perceive the order of the spheres; which is in this
wise: The first Sphere is the Natural; the second is the Spiritual,
the third, the Celestial; the fourth, the Supernatural; the fifth, the
Superspiritual; and the sixth, the Supercelestial.
I am now permitted to speak of matters pertaining to the Supernatural Sphere.
In this sphere are also three: societies and three distinct degrees of
Love, Will, and Wisdom-each society being unfolded fiom  the
one next below.
I perceive that an incessant transition is also occurring firom the
Third to this Sphere, and also an as immrnense transferation from this
to a still higher.
In this Sphere everything is still more lovely: and even here all
things appear to have attained the highest possible loveliness and exaltation. So true is this, that the inhabitants of the sphere next below,
in all their sparkling purity, appear even as undeveloped.  The beautiful emanation that surrounds and clothes each society, is of such an
intense light that it is impossible to approach it, or to search into the
interiors of the inhabitants.  Colors of every conceivable description
surround their local habitation, each being a bright indication of
purity, goodness, happiness, and wisdom. Every form and thing is
constantly growing lovelier and lovelier, and every sphere more
beautiful and pure.  Each indicates a spiral progression, and that
they are ascending nigh unto the throne of the Alpha and Omega.
Each thing shows forth its own purity, and speaks its own celestial
language.  Each object is distinct in its proclamations, and every
lesson of instruction is as a word of the Most High!
The first society is in numbers almost infinite: and from them
flows spontaneously an element of love that is clearer than the clearest water, and brighter than the brightest crystal; and its reflection
clothes the higher societies with a garment of whiteness pure as the
jewels that adorn the crown of the King of kings and the Lord of
lords.
And from the mediatorial society flows a constant stream of passive and active Will, subject at all times to the life-giving promptings
of Love, and receiving the high approbations of Wisdom. This is
constantly descending and ascending, as the light goeth forth firom the
sun to enliven the earth, and returns'to be revivified.
Wisdom in this supernatural Sphere, is as a fount that is constantly
springing up and flowing over all the subordinates. It is like a gre~'

668            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
receptacle in which are deposited the choicest thoughts and memories of the angels and spirits of this exalted Sphere.  It is like a
treasury whose contents are depositions for the lower angels, who
ascend to and unlock it, and extract from its depths beautiful
thoughts, and upon them ponder and meditate.  They have contemplations so exceedingly immense, that the Love and Life of the
Universe appear open to their thoughts, and they drink of their
depths and thirst not.
In a more exalted degree I behold those plains —decked with
life and beauty inconceivable; and over them is diffused an omi.prevalent element of purity that appears as life, and by this they live
and bloom in beauty.
In a different and higher degree, also, I perceive those ceaseless
streams of living water. Their gentle flowings speak only of tranquillity and unending happiness;  while the inexhaustible Fount
from which they spring proclaims the constitution and infinity of the
Divine Mind.
Also those undulating valleys, or wave-like variations, appear, presenting grandeur and loveliness indescribable.  They transcend all
possible conceptions of the lovely and beautiful; and their united
voices sink into the recesses of the soul, yet they are sileant and unheard.  They are penetrating as the electric fire, yet gentle as the
mountain-air.  They are dignified in their tone, and are withal impressively pensive.  They do not compel, but cause a voluntary submission to their undying teachings.
And again those groves are presented-and appear in a more exalted degree of loveliness.  They are as the tree of Righteousness,
budding and blossoming as the rose. They proclaim glory and
honor even in their refireshing shade, and inspire the reposer therein
with thoughts worthy of such a celestial home.
And the inhabitants are of the most exquisite purity and loveliness;
and they, with one united voice —a voice that arises not from spceck,
but firom action - proclaimn glory, honor, immortality, and eternal life.
They are wending their way up to the city of the living God. They
are illuminating the vestibule of truth and the archway that leads to
immortal life.  They are pervading all below them with the holy influences of wisdom, and with the most simple love.  Gentle as the
unsophisticated dove, they send forth a welcome to all below their
exalted state; and with a kind, peaceful, and inviting smile, they call
all to come away, and go with them to the Fount of purity on high!

NATURE' S DIVINE REVELATIONS.               669
The atmosphere of this spirit-home is rainbowed and clothed with
resplendent brightness, such as reflects the goodness of all things,
and the use to which they are applied. Yea, it is a mirror in which
are represented the living beauties of heaven and earth-even of
all things beneath this exalted state of perfection.
Such is the loveliness, goodness, and wisdom of the Divine Mind,
that nothing is made in vain; but everything is as a living thought,
and every thought is as a representative of perfect Wisdom.  Everything is thus admired, appreciated, and applied, in every degree of
material and spiritual existence; and in this Supernatural Sphere
this truth is especially and perfectly manifested.
~ 201. Inasmuch as life is universal, death can not mar the divine
constitution of things; and by virtue of this, tile inhabitants of the
Fourth Sphere, like those of others, repose for a moment in silence,
and awake as beings of the FIFTH SPHERE or Superspiritual habitation. And by and through this process, I am enabled to behold
the vast possessions of the fifth department of the great Temple of
Truth.
It is almost impossible to approach, yet I draw nigh and behold
with humility the extended landscape and living happiness, which are
here so exceedingly enchanting, that all I have previously beheld
appears clouded with comparative imperfection.  The vast landscape of this spiritual habitation is reflected on the perceptions of my
spirit with an impressiveness that renders all speech inadequate to
express the beauties thereof.
The first society, as in the third and fourth Spheres, is a child of
the highest society in the Sphere below. And here Love, Will, and
Wisdom, present a more attractive loveliness. Love appears as the
perfection of Wisdom, while Wisdom appears greater and more extensive than all the Love and Wisdom heretofore described, com
bined.
And it is well to relate, that as the Spheres approach the Divine
Mind, they become more simple, more lovely, more unassuming, and
more pure.  The nearer they approach the Fount of purity, the
more transparent they become, and the more do their inhabitants
appear to exist as it were without body and without external and artificial habiliments. They appear unclothed, and eminently purified.
There is an exhalation fiom each society that forms an encompassing halo of glory, which surpasses all brightness of the material sun





## p. 670 (#698) ############################################


670             NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
and all brilliancy that.illuminates any portion of the material Universe.
Each spirit seems so pure, and the thoughts of all seem so celestial, that it is almost impossible to resist the attraction thus presented.
There is such a commingling of thoughts, and such an affection
manifested for each other, as seems beyond all captivations imaginable.  Every mind is like an opening flower, and every thought is
like the firagrance thereof.  Every love is like a bud, and its expression is like the rose.  Their wisdom  is as the fountains of heaven
which dry not, and which perpetually flow to all that thirst, and heal
all that are wounded, and cleanse all that are not purified.  I behold
their Wisdom  in every thought, in every movement, and in every
expression of Will and Love. It is indeed beautiful! -and what
is to be lamented is, that language must be employed to speak of
that which defieth utterance.  O may expressive silence breathe forth
an eloquence that will penetrate the souls-of men, and duly elevate
their understandings; and may they be induced to abandon expression where speech is vain, and extend their conceptions to the bright
spheres of everlasting love!
Here, in the Superspiritual Sphere, the scenery possesses a redoubled grandeur and loveliness.  Still more perceptibly are the
thoughts of the Divine Mlind impressed on all created things.  The
plains, and valleys, and groves, and streams of living water, are all
instrumental in the great work of purification and refinement.  They
are all bright representatives of spiritual industry and universal love,
and are also living advocates of the perfection of Him who breathed
them and all living creations into being.
The spirits here are so lovely and attractive, that it requires an
effort to prevent being, as it were, absorbed into and becoming a
part of them.  Here I perceive another truth vividly manifested, and
that is, that all things possess mutual affinities, and that things differ
only as to degrees and states of development.  Thus is established,
what has been before declared, that opposites or antagonistic principles can not exist; that all things were created and are animated by
one living Essence; and that it is injustice to the character of that
Divine Essence for men on earth to say or believe that there is a
principle or habitation existing opposed to the general happiness, or
to that celestial purity which joins in one all created things.
This Sphere is so closely allied to the Spiritual Sun, that it becomes incomprehensible to the inhabitants of the earth —whose

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 671
sphere of existence is nothing more than one atom in the great Body
of material and spiritual constructions.
~ 202. As has been related of the transition of the spirits and angels of the Spheres below, so do those of the Fifth Sphere ascend
to, and become inhabitants of the SIXTH, or the Supercelcstial habitation.
Here is the consummation of all conceivable perfection!  Here
is the sublimation of all purity, of all goodness, and of all refinement,
as appertaining to the spirits of every human race in the Universe.
All spirits and angels are of the human races, and these occupy earths
innumerable, from which they ascend through all the Spheres to this,
the Supercelestial habitation.  Here they have combined all the perfections that have been uniformly unfolding while passing through
the ascending Spheres or stages of eternal progression.  This Sphere
is the great ultimate of all beauty, and the crown of all -loveliness
and purity.  Yea, it is the highest point of angelic loveliness.
Countless millions dwell in each society in each Sphere —more
than numbers can express. Yet the combined numbers dwelling in
all subordinate Spheres would not form any comparison with one haIf
of one society that dwells in this supercelestial home! How incon
ceivable, therefore, must be the immensity of each society in this
Sphere, inasmuch as the half of one society comprises more individuals than all the created forms that animate all the subordinate
Spheres of universal space! Yet creation has just begun1: Love is
just born, Will is just conceived, and Wisdom  is in the germ yet
undeveloped!
Here are the fields of Paradise; and on them is erected the house
of many mansions.  Interior splendor and gorgeousness is penetrating to all the spirits and angels thereof, and shines through then
with a brilliancy of celestial light, as the light of the Divine Mind
penetrates his whole material Structure.  And the exterior beauty,
grandeur, and magnificence of this celestial mansion, express in unequivocal language that it was not made by hands, yet is eternal in
the heavens. It is the great Asylum where all are taken in, and
loved, and breathed upon, and made perfect. It is the home of all
celestial things.
All things are divine, both in the material and spiritual Universe;
and all become celestial. So every created spirit is invited by the
progressive law of the Father to its home; and when it enters and

672            NATURE'S DIVINE REVELATIONS.
becomes sensible of the loveliness and purity thereof, it glorifies the
Father, not in prayer, but by thought and deed for ever and ever.
Each one, then, is an undying child of the Eternal One, who is the
Father of all: and no one is so low but that it is the highest of some
still lower, and no one is so high but that it is the lowest of some
yet undeveloped.  One spirit can not say unto another, "I need
thee not;" for each one is the sustainer of another, and the mutual
dependence constitutes the harmony and wisdom of all things.
In this Supercelestial home are all the beauties df earth and heaven
combined, developed, and perfected.  It is thus removed frotn human comprehension, and it can not therefore with profit be dwelt
upon, or impressed on the memory for meditation. Notwithstanding
what might be said concerning it are legitimate truths, they are too
high and refined to be comprehended by the human race —nay, even
by those in the Thi/rd Sphere of wisdom and knowledge. No one
can say with propriety, " Why not tell us all?" if he will but consider his incompetency to comprehend that which has already been
related.
The brightness in this state of celestial purity exceeds all concej)tion-and the elegance, majesty, power, grandeur, goodness, andi
happiness, transcend all human thought.  And here spirits and angels rejoice with exceeding joy and thanksgiving: and this by action,
and not by speech-by Wisdom, and not by Love.  Still Love is
the all-animating and life-giving element.
Such, then, is the immensity of these things, and such the greatness and glory of the Supercelestial habitation.  And it is proper not
to confide in that which is opposed to this ligh decree of angelic
purity, but to encourage hope when born of Wisdom, and belief
when well conceived; and then those things will descend to and illuminate the human mind, and give eternal life to that which now seems
mortal and changeable.
(~ 203. From the position now occupied I can perceive, and in a
degree comprehend, the SEVENTH SPHERE, or the Infinite Vortex
of Love and Wisdom, and the great Spiritual Sun of the Divine
Mind that illuminates all the spiritual worlds. —And behold, the
natural sun is the sun of the natural Universe, while the Spiritual
Sun was and is the Sun of the spiritual'Universe!  The material
can only illuminate the natural, and the spiritual illuminates the spiritual. Of the Body and constitution of the material sun, the Univer

coelum was born into being, and caressed, nourished, illuminated
and perfected, in universal order and harmony.  From  the constitution of the Spiritual Sun, all the heavens were created; and by it they
are sustained, controlled, purified, perfected, and illuminated: and
every spontaneous breath of light and love is as a smile of the allpervading Father and Creator of all that is, and of all that is not, developed.
Thus the Spiritual Spheres are allied to the Spiritual Sun, while the
natural spheres approach the material sun. Thus the spiritual is as a
soul, and yet a garment, to the natural, while the two are joined together
as one creation.  And the second or Spiritual Sphere sustains a relation
to the fifth Circle of Suns, and their innumerable planets-and is as
a soul to it, and comprehends the whole as one creation.  So the
third Sphere is allied to the fourth Circle; and the fourth Sphere to
the third Circle; and the fifth Sphere to the second Circle; and the
sixth Sphere to the first Circle: and the SEVENTH SPHERE is the
Great Sun and Centre of all power, and the Vortex of all creations!
This displays the order and harmony of the Divine Mind, and this
is one Body pf one Immortal SOUL!*
Much might be said of the Seventh Sphere, or thedSpiritual Sun
of the Universe-yet all would be inconsistent with the order and
power of the human mind. For speech is vain, and all that might
be said of the incomprehensibility, the magnitude, and the infinitude
of the truth centred in the Spiritual Sun, would consist only of words;
and these it would be useless to speak and impress upon the hurnan
mind.  Neither would it be proper to speak of the essences, qualities, and attributes, dwelling within the Vortex  from  which rolled
forth the Universe, inasmuch as each possible atom  comprehends
more than the human mind is able to grasp.  More, then, would be
superfluous and unprofitable.  For the word " incomprehlensible" falls
far short of conveying a definite idea of the immensity thereof; and
* On the next morning after the above was delivered, the clairvoyant was thrown
into the abnormal state for the purpose of examining some patients who were under
his medical treatment: but after the manipulations were completed, he remained
motionless and speechless for some fifteen minutes, when, in a faint whisper, he uttered the words " It is painful." He was then speedily restoed to the normal condition. At the close of the subsequent lecture he alluded to this circumstance, and
said that owing to the excitement remaining on his mind from the previous lecture,
his mind was, on the occasion referred to, elevated to such close proximity to the
Sphere of the Spiritual Sun, that the light was beyond endurance; and that had he
not been quickly relieved from his condition, his faculties would have been for a
time deranged.

even this word implies the impossibility of human understanding
This much only can be said: It is an inexhaustible Vortex of Life
and Light which are Love, and of Order and Form which are Wisdom-which flow not only into Heaven, but into the material Universe: and everything is thereby breathed into being. And the
Great Centre and Spiritual Sun is the habitation and throne of the
DIVINE MIND, thle Great Positive, Central Power of the Universe,
and of all eternal movement!  And it is a Fountain in which nothing exists but what is pure, divine, everlasting, and infinite!
~ 204. The natural Universe corresponds to the spiritual; and
one is related to the other as intimately as the body is to the soul.
For every spiritual Sphere is the creator, sustainer, and pervader, of
a natural Sphere; and this order is preserved in ever) department of
creation.
A mind was sufficiently illuminated to have an actual knowledge
of the relation and affinity existing between the natural and spiritual
Spheres, and of the Spheres to one another, and this was EMANUEL
SWVEDENBOiG.  He, however, employed terms to express the same
things that I lave endeavored to impress by terms of a different and
more congenial character.  He put forth the truth that there were
different degrees of goodness, and that the lowest was so imperfect
when compared with the highest, that the one seemed evil and the
other good; the one perfect and the other imperfect.  Hence he
describes the first three Spheres as three hells, inhabited by lower
spirits and angels; while the three higher Spheres were the three
heavens in which the higher spirits and angels dwelt.  He represented the first Spheres as being under the disapprobation of the allwise Judge, yet as being loved with an unfailing affection-while the
higher Spheres were near the Great Spiritual Sun, and their inhabitants dwelt under the smile of Divine approval. And he also related
the truth that the inhabitants of these Spheres could not approach
each other, because of the dissimilitude in their positions and degrees
of refinement —any more than evil can approach goodness, or darkness can approach light.
All this, I can'affirm, is true, not in tile absolutce, but rather in the
comparative sense. There is a seeming difference between the lower
and the higher in all things; yet the highest, as has been proved, is
an unfolded representative of what the lowest has in substance, undeveloped.  It-is, then, the use of terms, and their particular appli

NATURE S DIVINE REVELATIONS.                 67b
cation, that presents the apparent discrepancy existing between his
relations and these. And I can with assurance affirm, that the conceptions are the same in substance, and true-as is demonstrated by the
order and harmony of all visible things; and that a unity of thought
has arisen, by independent processes, firom no other cause than the
influxations of the truths of visible and invisible Nature.  From this,
as a common source, and from an illumination of the same, has the
relation of each been derived; and the two accounts from this cause
mutually substantiate each other.  Concerning this, then, I say no
more.
~ 205. The spirits of the various planets in our solar system are
in different stages of refinement.  And those that are on the higher
have the privilege of descending to the lower planets, and immersing
their thoughts into the spirits of the inhabitants at will, though the
latter in many cases know it not.  In this manner do spirits descend
to, and dwell on, the earth, when they have a peculiar attraction to
some relative or firiend; and they are ever ready to introduce into
his mind thoughts of higher things, and suggestions that are pure,
though these may seem to the person to flow independently firom the
workings of his own spirit.  Spirits firom  any sphere may, by permission, descend to any earth in the Universe, and breathe sentiments into the minds of others which are pure and elevating. Hence
it is that there are times when the mind appears to travel in the com,
pany of those it knows not, and has visions in its dreams that are
actually true, and sometimes come to pass with remarkable accuracy.
At other times, dreams are incited by the influx of thoughts from
spirits, but are not defined, because they are not duly directed.
There is, however, a species of dreaming which is uncaused by anything except an excitement of the nervous medium or consciousness
of the body.  Such dreams are only unquieted thoughts, and wild
and fantastic formations of thoughts pre-impressed into visions and
fancies.
It is a truth that spirits commune with one another while one is it
the body and the other in the higher Spheres —and this, too, when.
the person in the body is unconscious of the influx, and hence can,
not be convinced of the fact; and this truth will ere long present.
itself in the form of a living demonstration.  And the world will hail
with delight the ushering in of that era when the interiors of men,
will be opened, and the spiritual communion will be established suchl,

as is now being enjoyed by the inhabitants of Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn, because of their superior refinement,  Concerning these
things and their details, a knowledge can be had by perusing the
relations made by Swedenborg during the period of his mental illumination.
~ 206. The structure of the Universe is now presented to the
mind, and all its living beauties, together with the Divine Essence
that gives it life and animation.  It presents an indestructible basis
of hope and faith, and a corresponding foundation of human action.
It is as a mirror in which are reflected all corresponding beauties yet
uncreated, but proved to be in embryo by the universal teachings of
natural law.  The whole is BEAUTIFUL.  The whole is as ONE
BODY, and GOD the SOUL and FATHER of all living and unliving:things.  Everything is perfect in its way and state of being. Everything is necessary-even indispensable. Everything is pure, even
divine and celestial.  Everything teaches harmony, and universal
reciprocation by an unfailing manifestation of the same.  Everything
is of, in, through, and to, the Divine Mind.  All things are parts of
Him; and these are as one Whole, even Nature, Man, and Heaven.
The earths, or the first Sphere, constitute the germ; the second:Sphere is the roots; the third, the body; the fourth, the branches;,the fifth, the buds; the sixth, the blossom; and the seventh is
BEAUTY —-  beauty that blooms with an immortal fragrance.  Here
is the Tree of Righteousness-righteousness because all is right and
nothing wrong.  It is the Tree of Goodness-because nothing is
evil.  It is the Tree of immortal Lfe —because there is no death.
It is the Tree of divine Perfection-because there is nothing imper-,fect.  It is the Tree of Truth-because there is no falsehood in the
divine creations.  It is the Tree of eternal Causation-because,nothing is but what was in another form before.  It is the Tree of
Love and;WVisdom —because there is no confusion or disunity; for
all things are working together fo)r good, and that good is the eleva-.tion of all low and undeveloped things to a high degree of refinement
firom which a Universe yet unborn will be ushered into being to
breathe the breath of heaven.
Here, then, is the Tree whose foundation rests in the depths of
Time, and whose top extends to the heights of Eternity.  It puts
forth branches throughout the lengths and breadths of the Universe,

and casts a refreshing shade over the labyrinths of space whose limits
no thought can define.
Further contemplations upon these inconceivable creations would
be taxing the mind beyond its powers of thought, and would not tend
to usefulness. Yet a word fitly spoken, by way of admonition, may
not lose its influence'until some of the most desirable results are
accomplished. Remember, then, that the germ of this great Tree is
in the First Sphere, which comprehends all earths and their inhabitants.  Knowing this, let every one strive diligently to cultivate the
germ, and to make perfect its unfoldings.  Strive to give its properties and essences a proper and truthful direction. Put forth all love,
and energy, and wisdom, to effect that which i4 most desirable —that,
the principles of which are found in the nature of all men, and that
which prompts them  to profitable action; and, remember, that is
UNITY: and unity is HAPPINESS.
Inh view of these things, the importance and truthfulness of the
saying is manifested, that " The things which are seen are temporal;
Wut the things which are not seen are eternal:" and, also, that the
things which are visible are terrestrial; while the things which are
invisible are heavenly.  While these truths present themselves in
bold relief, the human mind should put forth efforts to comprehend
their signification and importance.  In doing this, mankind will
discover that the mind must be refined and perfected, and that
when this is properly accomplished, the social world will be correspondingly elevated, and thus be advanced to honor, goodness, and
UNIVERSAL PEACE.

PART II I.
THE APPLICATION;
OR,
A VOICE TO MANKIND.
THE' HUMAN RACE is composed of three distinct parts, classes,
or socicties.  The poor, ignorant, enslaved, oppressed, and working
classes, constitute the lower stratum  of society.  The semi-wealthy,
learned, enslavers, oppressors, and dictating classes, form the second
or transition stratum; and the rich, intelligent, enslaving, oppressing,
and idle classes, form the third stratum. and serve to complete the
body of Mankind.
The poor are distributed among all the nations of the earth,
They are those who are born amid circumstances opposed to their
nature and its requirements.  They are those who have necessities
unsupplied, desires ungratified, and affections uncared for.  The)y
are the degraded, the down-trodden, the forsaken and unappreciated
of the land.  They are the despised, the weak, the wretched, and
the repulsed, of all others that compose the human race.  Inferior
circumstances produce inferior effects; hence the poor are also ignorant.  And because they are uneducated, they are the more easily
chained in the degrading shackles of superstition, and enslaved by
laws imposed by government.  They are imbecile, and hence are
fit subjects to bear the burden and weight of the upper classes; and
feeling impressed that they are performing their duty, they submit to
arbitrary and tyrannical government.





## p. 680 (#716) ############################################


680                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
Inferior circumstances not only create these effects, but also slavery.
Millions that belong to the first part of the race, are existing under the
most oppressive slavery, and are compelled to do honor to those
who oppress them.  Their thoughts are restricted, and their innate
powers are crushed by those who hold them in bondage for the purpose of perpetuating the darkness of degradation to which they are
subject. They are also sorely afflicted, and with the most inhuman and
unnatural afflictions.  The symmetry of their forms is marred; the
constitutional qualities of their being are obstructed in their proper
development; and their spiritual faculties are clouded from birth to
the grave by vice, misery, superstition, and all manner of impositions
possible
The poor are thus oppressed (yet the oppressed are not always
poor); and oppression is a protective policy employed by those occupying a higher position in the scale of social circumstances.
The poor are also the laboringt and productive classes.  The wealth
of the world has been accumulated by the incessant toil of those who
are compelled by the hand of oppression to work constantly to gain
a subsistence: and yet their labor is not duly rewarded.  In every
portion of the world it is a general fact that he who labors the most,
receives the least in return.  And the more laborious the thinn in
which men engage, the more are they enslaved, degraded, and unrewarded.
The poor are the sustainers, because they are the industrious.
They are the producers of wealth, and of all the blessings that circulate through other and higher societies; and yet they are the forgotten, the despised, and the uneducated!
Poverty is such a universal affliction, that many are led to believe
that it is a means ordered in the providence of things for the purpose
of causing a submissiveness in the nature of man whereby he may
receive ultimate reward and consolation.  Some men are striving to
console the poor by these deceptive prospects; and such being im
pelled by interest, are anxious to have such an opinion prevail among
them, so that poverty and ignorance may be perpetuated, and that
thereby the permanency of their despotic and tyrannical control may
be secured.  In every portion of the earth the poor are uncared for,
and their circumstances are very seldom  relieved.  Still they are
the foundation of all that blesses the human race, and of all which
mankind enjoy.
The semi-wcaltihy are those who are situated amid superlior cir;cum

stances; and being thus situated from birth to death, they become
the mediatorial classes, learned in every department of art and agriculture.  These are the direct employers and governors of the lower
classes.  They exert a continual influence on those in their employ,
and press them to labor not agreeable to the constitution of man, and
for this labor give them little reward.  The mediatorial class thus
enslave and oppress those beneath them.  They are compelled to
do this by an interest which actuates all their movements; and they
are thus afflicting those striving for a subsistence, because their welfare and all their interests consist in a vast amount of labor and little
reward.  They are exceedingly oppressive, because society is so constituted that the interest of every man is in direct opposition to the interests of others: and thus what is one man's interest results in another's misfortune.
Tile higher class are the wealthy and powerful-holding within
their grasp the productions of those beneath them, and distributing
happiness only as it is extracted from them by the unceasing calls of
those who are oppressed and degraded.  They are the capitalists;
for the wealth which the poor create is accumulated by them, and
held within their grasp.  Wealth that rightly belongs to those who
create it, is thus given to those who earned it not, and hence have
no natural title to it.
The higher classes are those who rest upon the toil and labor of
the mass of Inankind.  They are thus both enslaving and oppressing,
because of their dependence and yet their controlling influence, which
is both unjust and destructive to the peace and happiness that otherwise would be enjoyed by the lower classes of community. They
are the enlightened; for being situated amid superior circumstances,
they have the advantage of all superior attainments and superficial
accomplishments existing in the world.  This intelligence is the only
pledge for the world's ultimate amelioration from vice, misery, and
degradation.  But this intelligence is at present improperly directed;
and instead of illuminating the mass of mankind, it is shrouding the
whole race with bigotry, superstition, and prejudice!  It is making
more ignorant those classes which are ignorant, and confirming them
in their low and unfortunate situations.  Meanwhile it is dividing the
human family into sects and exclusive classes, and is also creating
every species of disunity and dissatisfaction.
The poor and moderate classes are not the governing, but the gove.rned.  They are not the enslavers, but the enslaved.  They are

not in themselves tile impure and unsanctified, but are made so by
those above them.  They are not the unfortunately constituted, but
become weak and deformed by the burden of the responsibility universally imposed upon them.
The wealthy being the powerful, from  them  flow all arbitration,
oppression, and absolute misery, that prevail in the world. It is
from this class that exclusiveness and sectarianism take their rise,
and flow like an ocean-tide over all the classes beneath them.
The rich, as to theirfavorable situations, are examples of what the
Race will be, when equal wealth and equal justice pervade the
social world.  Intelligence will then be the governor and administrator of all laws and principles required by the constitution of
the hurnan family.  Then all may drink at the fount of Knowledge,
and thirst not. But owing to the disunity that prevails in society,
the wants of the lower classes are not supplied, and the desires of
those in the higher classes are supplied with such a profusion, that
they are unable to appreciate the blessings of life, and the natural
enjoyments flowing  from  a well-ordered desire and its adequate.
gratification.
These three classes constitute the Human Race; and each of them
will exist in its present condition so long as intelligence is exclusive,
labor is unrewarded, and wealth is possessed by those who have it
unjustly.
~ 2. The poor are those who have desires unsupplied.  Thus they
are rendered miserable, and their existence is entirely unappreciated.
They are those who have all the pressure and the afflictions of the
race; and by their ignorance they are compelled to remain thus situated.  They can not set forth with moving eloquence the vice and
misery that prevail among thein; they can not free themselves from
the shackles which bind and. crush them to the earth.  They can not
escape the prison of sectarianism, nor raise their voice against the
many inhuman proceedings that are instituted against them.  The
poor lie at the lowest point in society, and are therefore sustaining,
by their perpetual industry, the great weight  of the world that rests
upon them.  They have no means to extricate themselves,; or to advance where everything opposes their progress and arrests their ascension.  They can not accumulate force and power of themselves,
because each person is striving for a subsistence, and laboring to
supply his increasing wants.  General power is thus lost and dissi

Dated among individuals; which prevents them from acting as a body
to ameliorate their condition.
The highest society exists as if they were not in possession of
feeling and affection for what is just, and good, and righteous. They
seem to be unconscious of sympathy, and unable to discern the cause
of the evil and misery that prevail.  They are seemingly striving to
benefit all; yet in that which appears to benefit most, a greater injury is done to the working-classes.  And every isolated act of benevolence, though meant for good, ends in affliction; and every
effort toward amelioration creates sectarian hostility, and terminates
in depression of the most tyrannical character!
Society is thus constructed.  It will preserve its structure in form
for ever; but its constitutional developments will change ere long,
materially —the result of which will be distributive justice and harmony.
The cause of all human action is centred in these three things:
Love (or desire), Necessity, and Interest.  Desires are created by the
love, or bodily requirements.  Necessity is the desire ungrati6fed, or
the requirement unsupplied; and Interest is the spring of action, and
is a means by which love is rewarded, by which desires are gratified,
and necessities supplied.
Interest, then, is the mode of human action, and is the ultimate
cause of all industry, all invention, all movement, and intelligence,
in the world.  Interest is the means employed to supply the necessities of the human body.  Where there is no interest, there can be no
action; where there is no desire, there can be no interest; and where
there is no love, there can be no desire.
It is impossible for -a man to act without an interest.  His interest
may consist in self-gratification or emolument; in sectarian advancement; in local usurpation; in general benevolence, brotherly kindness,
and charity; in universal love, or in the attainment of knowledge.
But in whatever thing his interest is centred, for that will he act
alone; and while thus acting, he will, as society now exists, injure
some and benefit others, please some and excite indignation in others. -And thus it is that interests (being the cause of human action!
will, if not directed aright, produce unhappy consequences.
The interests of the poor consist in rendering themselves and their
families happy.  To this end they exert all their abilities to extract
from the earth, and absorb from the higher societies, a sufficient re

.684                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
ward for their labor.  Their interests are opposed to the interests of
those who employ them; and this creates an antagonism between the
laborer and him for whom he labors.  One is diametrically opposed
to the other.  Thus it is that while industry becomes fatiguing and
disgusting to the laborer, the employer is pressing him to more and
heavier action, and meanwhile reduces his reward to the lowest possible amount.  The laborer is thus discouraged from laboring cheerfully, and the employer is discouraged from  rewarding abundantly.
The interest of the laborer consists in the reuard; the interest of
the employer consists in the amount of labor accomplished: therefore one is absorbing from the other; and the absorption creates distinction, obstruction, and disunity.  They are thus existing in direct
opposition to each other.
Thus labor is despised and shunned by the human family, because
it is unappreciated.  Hence ioverty pervades the world; and this is
perpetuated by disunity of interests and a want of sympathizing feelings and affections between man and man.  The poor have no regard for the situation of the rich, nor the rich for that of the poor;
and they thus despise and repulse each other.  Tile unfortunate
circumstances that surround and embarrass the poor firom birth, encourage the monopolies of the higher classes, and the interests of the
latter consist in the distinction thus created.  It thus becomes impossible to discover harmony between the interests of the poor and
rich, or affinity between their respective situations.
Men may have their judgment convinced of what is their duty; yet
their interests consist in that to which their duty is oiposed.  Hence
the world is immoral and disorganized.  It is proper that all should
be so situated as that industry may become a necessity, and that its
reward may be legitimate and proportional.
If universal industry existed, all would be wealthy, and all would
appreciate and glorify their existence. Neither would there be so
much labor needed; for a little labor, if properly directed, would
contribute more to the general wealth of the world than twice the
same amount in the present condition of the human race.  One third
of the present amount of individual labor, if equally distributed and rendered profitable, would contribute more to the happiness and wealth
of mankind than the amount of individual labor now performed; and
then rewards would be equal, interests reciprocal, and all action universally beneficial.  As interests now are opposed to each other, all
action of laborer and employer must necessarily be in corresponding

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                     r;S6')pposition.  Hostility is constantly being generated by the disaffection for each other's welfare, arising from this cause. Every one has
desires uncared for by others, and necessities which none but himself knows, and for the relief of which no one but himself provides.
The provision is extracted fr-om, not fireely given, as it ought to be,
by others, or the body of the human race.  Thus one's interest consists in that for which no other has an affinity.
And so conflicting are the situations of men in the lower strata of
society, that there is nothing but vice, misery, discontent, hostility,
and retaliation, existing.  Their interests are like conflicting, elements,
which in meeting, destroy each other's power. Hence the harmony
that would exist, if interests ran gently into each other, is dissipated.
Hence he is immorally situated whose duty tells hini one thing and
his interests another.
~ 3. The laborer, feeling an interest in the amount of reward given
for his toil, has no interest in the general improvements in machincry
that are made to relieve and curtail labor.  Labor must be appreciated and duly remunerated, before there can be either a pleasure in
industry, or a general interest taken in mechanical and agricultural
improvements.  That inactivity may be repulsed-from the earth, industry must command increased rewards.  There must not only be a
higher value set on industry, but a higher regard must be manifested to
him who labors, in order to make all feel an interest in activity, and
that no one may feel an attraction to idleness and speculation.  The
laboring-classes support those who are idle, and the idle in return
despise and oppress those who labor, because their interest is not in
industry, but in unfeeling speculation.
The interest of the laborer should consist in the. thing on which he
is employed.  Then he would press onward in his physical and mental exertions to improvements of the most valuable character, such as
would not only ameliorate his own condition, but would send forth a
blessing over the whole world.  As things are now existing, the
laborer feels an interest in the reward only, and not in the employment itself. Therefore labor is disgusting and tiresome, while its
reward alone actuates the worker; and thus the proper development
of his physical and intellectual powers is discouraged and obstructed.
The laborer feels no interest in the advancement of his employer's
interest, but merely in the amount of reward he may extract from
him, and which is necessary to his subsistence.  He who employs

686                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
feels no interest in the poor and their necessities, but exerts his
power and ingenuity to press the laborer to every possible extreme,
and then remunerates him agreeably to his own interests.  The employer does not reward the laborer because he feels an interest in his
and his family's welfare.  On the other hand, after compelling him
to labor excessively, he pays him only as a man would feed his herds
at night. Nay, the classes who speculate upon the poor and the oppressed, in nmany instances do not scruple to force them from their
families at an hour which all the laws of the human system have appropriated to rest, into the field of labor or the workshop of toil, and
after compelling them to work without cessation until their energies
are exhausted, reward them as their own power and interest may
dictate-even as a man would drive a mule from his stable, oppress
him with heavy burdens during the day, and at night requite his labor, and hunger, and prostration, in proportion to the amount of food
le has garnered up for all his extensive herds.
The poor are thus oppressed, and the laborer is thus not justly
rewarded.  They not only have no interest in mechanical improvements, but have none in the cultivation of their own powers; for all
their physical energies are concentrated, day after day, on gaining a
subsistence, and their mental powers are circumscribed to the limited
circle of their degraded occupation.
Men should be rewarded in proportion to the anmount of labor they
accomplish, and then they would feel an interest in industry, and not
merely in its reward.  At present, however, he who labors most and
suffers the most oppression, receives the least reward; he who is idle
and subsists upon the labor of others, is both abundantly rewarded,
and extensively appreciated for supposed goodness and virtue.
It is true that virtue exists only where vice is not; and it is, moreover, true that he who is idle, is necessarily vicious- and is no more
than an unnecessary particle (or person) in the constitution of the
human family. Such a one is an excrescence to society, and is an
injury to the welfare and happiness of the laboring and industrious.
Nothing can be more injurious to the human race than an inactive
population, or a class of persons who despise, and yet subsist and
speculate upon, the labor of others-of those who are degraded.
The beehive of industry typifies what the race should and will be.
In the economy of the beehive, one thing is particularly to be remarked: and that is, that every inactive bee is considered a drone to
the community, and therefore all interest and affection are withdrawn





## p. 687 (#723) ############################################


A VOICE TO MANKIND.                     687
from it; and they all decide that the bee is thus an iujury to the welfare of the whole, and that it must be cast from their midst for ever.
Every bee is obliged to contribute its share to the wealth and elevation of the whole mass; and they are taught to feel an instinctive
affection for the universal welfare.  And having their interests thus
centred, nothing can thwart their activity for the benefit of each other
and the whole; nothing can prevent the accumulation of wealth, or
destroy the happiness which they universally enjoy. Here, then, the
philosophy of social harmony is represented; and all that is necessary
for the human family to do, is to adopt a corresponding system.
Poverty is necessity unsupplied; and therefore this indicates disease in the organization of society.-For if all men were properly
situated, want would not exist in any part, while an abundance belongs to the body as a whole: and absorption would not exist while
every one created his own happiness and meanwhile the happiness
of others.
Vice, degradation, necessity, and misery, pervade society only because there is no unity in the interests and movements of men.  He
who has a family to support, seeks to serve some person who tmay
give him a reward adequate to his wants. But if there is no sympathy extended to his necessities, he drowns his crushed feelings and
his domestic embarrassments in the depths of intoxication.  He goes
to every extreme in this vice for no other purpose than to sear his
sympathies against the cries of his children, and his sensibilities to
the supplications of his wife! He becomes unnerved and incapable
of laboring, even if labor is procured; and anticipating a most wretched dejection in his own family, he lays his hands on the possessions
of others, and ingeniously conveys something to his family.  Thus a
theft is committed; and now the community is for the first time aware
that such a miserable being existed!  They appeal to conventional
laws, investigate his case, and employ unfeeling magistrates to seal
his imprisonment.  No one feels an interest in his welfare; but all
are pleased at his capture, condemnation, and repulsion from the
bosom of society, and the light of the sun that smiles on all, that all
may be happy!Not long from this and a family is thrown upon the institutions,
destitute of all bodily requirements, physical strength, and mental
energy.  The children are situated among circumstances of the most
vitiating and corrupting character.  The mother is unable to perform

688                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
her duty toward them, and they are led into the paths of vice, ignorance, and prostitution. Nay, every invention is sought out by them
to relieve their immediate wants, and improve their external condition.  Under various circumstances, those children advance to maturity, and are then thrown upon society to find employment by
which they may live, if they are fortunate and successful in their
movements. It may be that some one of them will advance to a position tending to unfold the physical and mental powers, and such a
one may bring forth living evidence of innate genius and magnanimity
of soul.
Another one may seek domestic labor, but being incapacitated, is
unsuccessful, becomes disheartened, and is cast out by the employer,
uncared for, upon the disunited and conflicting world!  This one
will flee for refuge into the paths of vice and misery — will seek shelter where no human being should lie, and drown all sensibilities in
tile abundance of vice into which he or she is immersed-and per-!haps end where the father did, a dishonor to society, and an outrage
to the Inoral sensibilities of the human race!
Another may be situated differently, but still where influences are
corrupting and opposed to the proper direction of the faculties.  This
one may be selfish, ferocious, and barbarous in the extreme-even
to the destruction of a fellow-being's life-and finally swing before
the gazing world as a rejpresentation of its ownl corru2ption, ignorance,
and finaticism!
Another one, being a female, and because of unfavorable birth
being des'pised, may seek seclusion from the scoffs of an unfeeling
world in the sinks of iniquity and prostitution-and there live as a
representative of social disunity, discord, degradation, and conflicting
individual interests.
Here, then, is a family unknown to the world, until some one of
them, pressed by poverty, commits a depredation; and then the community takes an interest, not in the unfortunate, but in him who loses
for the benefit of that desolated family!  Then one member after
another becomes known  and despised!  Every innate energy is
crushed by the withering frowns of the social world! Every pure
aspiration is pressed back upon the soul, because it needs an atmosphere of light, liberty, and social happiness.  The light of genius
is clouded by the inferior circumstances surrounding and obstructing
its development.  Nay, every pure and innate quality of the human
soul is arrested in its growth, because society smiles not on its ten

derness, nourishes not its roots, and assists not, by superior circumstances, its growth. Everything tends to darken the sun of vivacity
and future prospect; and where the light and heat of this dwell not,
the human soul can not bud and blossom, for its soil is barren and
uncongenial!
~ 4. Interests are thus mutually opposed; and the effects of the
opposition are the evil and misery that prevail in the world.  No man
would be evil in action if he had,not an interest in being so. No
man would touch the wine-cup were it not to gratify some unhealthy
desire, created by influences and situations in which men are often
existing.  No man would defraud his neighbor and plunder his possessions, if all wants were supplied and desires gratified.  No man
would injure or destroy the lifb of his neighbor, were it not to accomplish some end, being actuated by a necessity unknown to community.  Neither would man injure his neighbor, if his interests consisted in his neighbor's welfare. No man would deceive or falsify,
if his interests consisted in honesty and unrestricted benevolence.
Finally, no man or woman in the human race would do an unlho-ty
deed, if their interests consisted in the interest of the whole, so as to
comprehend both individual and universal happiness.
Community are aware of all unholy deeds when they are commnitted; and they manifest no sympathy toward the unfortunate perpetrator, but have an interest in his condemnation and imprisonment.
If society felt an interest in the welfare of its individuals, then men
would not be in situations that are vitiating, but would be placed
amid superior circumstances, and thus benefited and rendered useful
to the requirements of the community at large.
All these'evils arise from this one fact-that labor is unrewarded
and unappreciated; and hence that labor is disgusting to him who is
compelled to perform it, and absolutely abhorred by those who subsist on the industry of the poor and oppressed. No interest is felt in
labor itself, but merely in its emoluments. No interest is exercised
for the general good, but all interests are isolated, corrupting, ensla —
ving, and disorganizing.  No interest is centred in the general advancement and happiness of the race, but merely in individual acquisitions of wealth, and power, and aristocratic rank.  No interest is
felt in the condition of those who are unhappily situated from birthl
to the grave, but everything is against the cultivation of their powers,.

of their lives.  No interest is exercised in behalf of those who are
unable to assist themselves and enjoy the rightful blessings of life;
but all are striving to advance to individual power, and honor, and
emolument-are even willing to exert a commanding influence over
those who are depressed and unable to resist the tyrannical domination thus exercised over them.  No interest is universal, but all are
isolated, individual, and corrupting: and all this is existing because
labor is not appreciated as a universal blessing, and esteemed in
proportion to its tendency to elevate the human race.
The laborer is entitled to something more than arising at daybreak,
going forth into the field and toiling till dark, and then returning to
his couch cf straw, and awaking again with body prostrated and suffering with hunger.  Industry is entitled to more than this; for activity is the wealth of the. world, and the use and destiny of man.
Yet it is a truth that in various portions of the world, laborers are,confined to the meanest subsistence, and their bodies are sacrificed
to the enslaving and degrading speculations of idle men.  They are
forced almost from their cradles to the plantation or tile manufacturing establishment, and are compelled to work as long as sunlight will
permit, then to return to their desolate homes fatigued and unrewarded!  While they are obliged to lead a life like this, those subsisting
uipon their labors pass on regardless of the destitution spread before
them.
Interests are so conflicting, that men sacrifice their real dignity of,character and moral worth,- by engaging in every species of fraud,
imposition, and cruel speculation -and that, too, as practised upon a
multitude of uneducated beings who are confined to labor of the most,oppressive character, both in the field and in the workshop.  He
vwho, by the workings of social circumstances, happens to be born
where this oppression and slavery exists, knows no use of his own
being, nor of the enjoyments to which he is entitled by Nature and
lher extensive provisions.
In the various countries and kingdoms of the earth, monarchical
governments and exclusive and arbitrary laws are instituted as a protective policy and safeguard to aristocracy and despotism.  And they:are also as walls, defending the accumulated wealth of idlers against
absorptions by the poor within their dominions. Every kingdom,'with all its wealth, owes its birth to the incessant industry of the injured and unrewarded poor.  The most stately lord is nothing more

than a drone, supported by those compelled to till the soil and bring
forth its wealth and excellences. —And while the land is burdened
with lords and inactive men, the poor must be degraded and deprived
of their just dues; and where such useless materials exist, vice, poverty, and wretchedness, will also dwell.  These latter are unfailing
representatives of indolence, lordly aristocracy, and despotic governments.  Where suffering most exists, there the burden of idle and
useless materials is.  And this suffering in society is always an unfailing indication of conflicting interests, which are constantly producing violations of the injunction, " Thou shalt love thy neighlbor
as thyself."
It is impossible to find a radical distinction between the natures
or the requirements of different men: but there is a difference only
in the degrtce in which these are manifested. Some men require
more than others in the way of physical or mental food; yet all are
entitled to as much as they desire, especially when that desire is
governed by a well-ordered Wisdom.
~ 5. As he who tills the soil feels no absolute interest in its productions, but only in the paltry sum given for his labors, so the science of agriculture has not advanced to that degree of perfection of
which it is capable.  All improvements are such as result firom isolated effort, and therefore they are not such as to visibly benefit mankind, but their benefits are dissipated by vain speculation.
MECHANICS feel no interest in the improvement of machinery, any
further than it conduces to individual wealth.  There is no general
interest manifested for the relief and consequent reward of the laborer.  Hence, if mechanics improve in arts and sciences which
abridge manual labor, they also take the food fiorn him whose employment is destroyed.  It is clear, then, that the interests of the
laborer are opposed to those of the mechanic; and the conflict creates hatred and local persecution.
Every new invention should be hailed with shouts of joy by all, as
conducing to the relief of laborious employment, and to the advancement of the race.  But instead of this, every new invention is frowned
upon with all the jealousy of disunited interests.  Thus genius is
crushed, and the poor man's energies are prostrated by the nonreception of his invention and the non-appreciation of his ingenuity.
If a man should invent a floatingo battery as a means of destruction,
or plan any other new mode of destroying human life and the interests

Of nations, then would the public encomiums be warm and enthusiastic. Any new and deathly instrument is hailed by all as a reliever
of national hostility, and an indirect benefit to the poor and unfortunate.  This is an expression of a public feeling characterizing every
nation of the earth; and how unholy are the conditions which give
rise to this feeling! These conditions breathe hatred and wretch- 
edness into the bosom of every excitable being, and deposite the
poison of envy in each neighbor's cup; and when they drink, all descriptions of prejudice, hostility, strife, persecution, and fanaticism,
flow from their intoxicated minds!
The community is thus disordered, even in its departments of mechanical industry. Every new invention for the destruction of life
is smiled upon by the mass; but every new invention for the destruction of degrading toil, and for the elevation of the interests of the
race, is only hailed with delight by a few good and benevolent minds,
while the mass, feeling conscious that it crosses their interests, scout
at and frown it down, that it may not go forth to their injury.  The
laborer is thus opposed to mechanical improvement. Any exertion
in the way of such improvement is the commencement of hostility
and persecution between the inventor and the mass of laborers.
TRADESMEN are all engaged in isolated pursuits, diametrically
opposed to each other. Each one establishes a capital and a business
where the most advantage can be taken of his neighbor and of the
community. Thus isolated business among the tradesmen is leading to the most ingenious deception and falsehood. He who can
converse with the most freedom, and present the most external inducements, has the advantage over his neighbors in his accumulations of wealth as derived and extracted from the community; while
he who is less competent in these respects, ultimately fails in his
enterprise, and then receives for his consolation the fiendish exultations of his neighboring tradesmen.
It is right and profitable to unveil the corruptions of society, and
to present a mirror in which the actions and situation of every person
may be visibly and justly represented.  Nothing is more injurious to
the mnorals of community, and more enslaving to the poor man, than
the vast congregation of tradesmen, whose interests are as much op-.posed to each other as the darkness of midnight is to the light of
noonday. More vice exists among this class of community than in
any other department of society. They are connected with each
other locally, and are joined externally, to extract an unreasonable

profit from him who buys —yet they are internally bitterly opposed
to each other's welfare; and each one is compelled by interests to
overreach and deceive his neighbor.  The fact of their being thus
impelled by misdirected interests, generates every species of vice and
disunity among themselves and in society.  The buyer enters the
establishment of the tradesman with the full conviction that the latter
will deceive him if possible.  Therefore the interests of the buyer and of
the seller are in direct opposition to each other.  And what is worse
than all is, that there is a distrust of virtue and morality deposited in
the bosom of every man toward his neighbor and the world!
As society is existing, men are considered uneducated if they have
not an acute perception of their neighbors' faults and follies, or if
they are not at all times prepared with deceptive plans to overcome
the intrigues and deceptions of others.  If a man has grown up firom
the cradle to manhood, in a little community where peace and harmony dwell, having no suspicion of evil or deception as pervading
society, and having an implicit confidence in the purity of the dealings of mankind with each other; and if ihe should go forth into a
community of desperate and unfortunately-situated men, he would
be deceived in the most cruel manner.  His property would be taken
from him for one half its value; his pure spirit would be corrupted;
his confidence would be, betrayed, and his natural genius smothered:
and for all this loss, he would receive the fiendish sneers of the tradesmen, because he was not educated, and aware of their ingenious expertness!  Thus no men are more viciously situated than tradesmen,
and none are doing a more direct iijury to the social requirements
of all mankind.
The poor man is entitled to food and clothing in as great abundance, and even greater, than he who subsists upon the poor man's
labor.  But what a hopeless adventure it is for an honest man to
prefer this claim, or to endeavor to procure suitable garments for his
person! In the first place, the article fiom which clothing is made
is gathered from the earth which he cultivates.  Its owner demands
and receives a.profit from the manufacturer-who presses the operatives to labor for little reward, that his profit may be greater when
lie transfers his produce to the tradesman.  By the time tlie tradesman receives the cloth, the profits consume more than its origi72al
value.  The tradesman is, however, entitled to a profit also, and
this the buyer must pay.  The poor man then receives of the
tradesman his garments, and is compelled to pay the combined

694                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
tariffs and profits of the agriculturist, the manufacturer, and the
tradesman!
Thus from the labor of the poor man are all these various and
conflicting situations sustained, and the many persons therein engaged
constantly supported.  Surely it is not strange that poverty exists
where capital is so isolated and interests so discordant.
Tradesmen are also striving to succeed at the sacrifice of each
other's interests; and while doing so, they affect the manufacturer,
the operatives, the agriculturists, and those who toil from early dawn
till evening without reward.
There should be no local, isolated establishments, such as are now
existing; but there should be a genecral storehouse for every community and every city; and this should be abundantly supplied by the
united industry of the whole commnunity.  Not a tear should be shed
in consequence of hunger; no bosom should throb with pain or sink
with disconsolation.  No child should be left to shiver from cold, or
suffer deprivation of natural wants; no mother should lament her
children's, her own, or her husband's destitution.  Nor should there
be a life sacrificed at the altar of want, or destroyed by the hland of
fearful starvation; for those stores of wealth and abundance should
yield a subsistence to every one who moves and dwells in the human
form.  Then tradesmen's interests would consist merely in assisting
others to their natural demands, and not in keeping from them every
article of comfort and subsistence which they may hold within their
own grasp, as at present.
6~. The LAWYER'S interest is opposed to gceneralpeace and rightcousness.  Lawyers are in situations which make them interested ih
the disturbances that prevail, and not in the general tranquillity of
community.  They have their interests centred in the numerous litigations caused by persecution and hostility.  XWhere vice exists,
poverty prevails to an equal extent; and where vice and poverty prevail, the lawyer is most powerfully attracted.  Instead of being peacemakers, they are peace-destroyers; inasmuch as the settlement of
every legal question must be for or against the individuals concerned.
The result of this is latent envy, and a secretive determination to
have their demands satisfied, and that, too, when the laws of society
can take no cognizance of their plans to deceive and injure.  Every
act of adjudication among the legal profession is the commencement
of interior hatred and hostility.  And besides this, every man seeks

refuge in the laws of society and the state, against the injuries of his
neighbor; and this is the strongest indication of disease in the constitution of society.  For local quarrels and conflicts are blemishes
that affect society as ulcers affect the diseased body; and it is clear
that blemishes would neither affect society nor the body of man, if
the interior qualities and particles of the constitution were pure,
united, and circulating throughout the whole form with a perfect
equality. Evils that exist in society are like diseased parts of the
body; and the open contentions manifested through the workings of
vice are like pains that affect the body: and both testify of internal
corruption.  And he is the true peace-maker who strikes at the root
of social evil, and who destroys the fruit of the contaminating tree.
If the poor of the earth were educated, and their feelings were refined, there would be no stooping to the vice of deception and falsehood; neither would there exist so much disunity which lawyers are
employed to settle according to the established codes of tile land.
And every legal decision is a virtual protest against the prevalence
of morality and unity of human interests.  If the mechanic labored
in connexion with the tiller of the soil, and their enterprises were
mutually assisting to each other, such a thing as contention and
lawsuits between themn would not be known.  Did tradesmen act in
accordance with the requirements of the mechanic and the laborer,
then would their reciprocal action create harnlony, and the lawyer
would have no occupation.
The lawyer's interest is therefore decidedly opposed to this state
of things; and as they are exerting an undue influence in society,
their opposition will retard the progress of social, moral, and universal reforn.  Their interests consist in the prevalence of ignorance
and imbecility, in the greatest amount of strife, Qontention, and deception, and-in every species of corruption and degradation that now
render society a disgusting body-even as a whitened sepulchre,
full of dead men's bones!
Lawyers, as men, are good and honest, like all other men; but
how deplorable to reflect on their corrupting situations!  From these
situations spring the most unhealthy influences into the bosom of society; and instead of reforming and equalizing mankind, and alnicably settling their difficulties, they are merely casting a veil over
blemishes by an external legal process, while that wlhich the)y conceal
is rife with all sorts of evil, extortion, and excess.  No verdict is
given without violating as many feelings as it gratifies.  Hence a

great portion of the counteracting and conflicting feelings that are in
the world, are because the verdicts of conventional laws are in favor
of or against the established interest or prejudice of some person or
persons.  It can not be said that they are relieving the evils of society, so long as verdicts are isolated and superficial in their character.  The laws of Nature are unlike this.  Their verdicts are manifested to all beings, and all acknowledge their justice, and are encouraged by their unfailing distribution of justice to every created
formn.
The lawyer's interest therefore consists in the amount of vice and.misery that prevail, and not in the peace, and unityr, and happiness,
which the world is striving to enjoy.  The lawyer's situation is thus
the most unenviable of any except that of the cleigyman.  IBut lawyers are to be relieved fiomrn their positions ere long, by feeling a
thrilling conviction of the truths of Nature, and by her unceasing demands for social reform  and distributive justice.  It is pleasing to
contemplate the day when men will forsake theory, sect, philosophy,
prejudice, and situation, for the sole purpose of fulfilling their use in
the nature of things, and thereby to establish happiness in every portion of the world: for each will have a position created by his own
industry.
~ 7. The PHYSICIAN'S interest consists in the amount of organic
violation that occurs, and in the abundance of distress and physical
wretchedness that are found in the sick-room, the hospital, the asylum, the prison, the army, and throughout the nation. Physicians,
as men not professionally employed, will express the most unbounded benevolence, and actual sympathy, for the suffering that exists.
They will express all the yearnings of noble minds for the improvenment and education of the poor and ignorant, and for superior situations to bless the poor man's home and the rich man's constitution.
But a physician, in his occuplation, feels no interest in any new invention, or system, or compound, that might be effectual in curing
disease.  He feels no interest in the advancement of intelligence on
the subjects of anatomy and physiology, because a general knowledge of theorganic structure of man would lead to a great amount'
of health, inasmuch as then all would strive to avoid violation.  He
feels no interest in the prevalence of physiological knowledge, nor is
he interested in any degree of reform leading to a destruction of vice,
debauchery, and physical violations. Disease and pain exist because

the science of life and the necessities of the human body are unknown
to a majority of the human race.
The poor man is obliged to exert all his physical energies to gain
a subsistence for himself and family. He is thereby subject to exposures of every possible description, and to sufferings that are intolerable.  The atmosphere may change, and bring disease to his
exposed body. Labor may be excessive and disproportionate; and
its results inay be deformity, contractions, inflammttions, and muscular prostration, some or all of which are a portion of the poor man's
reward.  Thus exposed, he sinks under disease; and when prostrated on his couch, amid his family whose wants are unsupplied, he
ventures to raise his voice to the wealth and philanthropy of society
in supplication, and humbly solicits relief. What is the reply which
he receives?  It is the frowns and silent abuses of the communityand he can see that the world regards him  not.  Thus forsaken, he
languishes and departs unappreciated! Such examples are, in modified forms, visible in every portion of the world.  The physician
feels no interest in the health of that sick man, and it is a matter of
indifference to him whether his pains are soothed or his situation relieved.  He seeks not the poor man, because the little attraction
(which is insignificant indeed) is not in the poor man's possession.
Therefore the poor man is neglected, because the physician's interest
consists, not in the prevalence of health, but in the extent of disease
among those able to reward his labors.
The wife and children of this poor man are also exposed to inclement weather, and to every description of destitution possible to
conceive.  The wife, exercised by grief and depressed with sorrow,
becomes weakened and emaciated, and finally occupies the bed just
deserted by her unfortunate and neglected companion.  She, too, is
encompassed with sorrow, and is afflicted with privations, which society perceives not.  Amid the cries of her children, she is depressed
beyond the possibility of a resurrection; and she soon closes her eyes
upon the world with a fear, and dread, and sorrow, unknown to any
but herself: and the last vibration upon her ear is the cry of hunger
arising from her infant child!  She thus dies a sacrifice to human
injustice and social disorganization!
The children, one by one, are taken and placed in the asylum, and
there cared for in proportion to the reward given to the physician
and the overseer.  There they are treated as strangers; there they
grow like the plant uncultivated, and finally become a burden to

the community and the keeper of the almshouse who supports
them all.
If the physician were well situated and properly rewarded, he
would seek the afflicted, relieve their pains, and strive to inculcate
physiological truths whereby disease might be avoided, and unnecessary violations escaped. If the physician were rewarded in proportion to the amount of health that exists, then would he feel anxious
to have vice, and misery, and degradation, and debauchery to cease,
and health to bless the existence of every man.  These corruptions
gyrate through all portions and classes of society, and the physician is interested therein.  And where disease is in abundance,
there he is attracted, not because he feels interested in the health and
prosperity of his patients, but in that which he receives for his medical
attentions.
Nothing can be more dishonoring to the convictions of the physician than the corrupting situation which he occupies; for he is compelled to follow the promptings of his interest, while his convictions
of duty and his higher sensibilities wveep over his ill-directed proceedings.  The physician's duty, like that of the lawyer and the
clergyman, is sensibly impressed on his judgment by Nature, and lie
would cheerfully comply with its dictates, were he not so viciously
and unhappily situated.  But interest is the governing principle of
human existence; and the object to be attained is so to change the
situations 6f men that their interests may correspond with the admonitions of their enlightened judgments.
The physician has an internal conviction which he can not suppress, that what lie is obliged to do in his profession is directly opposed
to his duty.  He can not resist this conviction; and the same is true
of the lawyer, mechanic, and the laborer.  And this truth unfolds
the fearful and horrible fact in the condition of the human racethat men are not only contending with each other in their social occupations, but that there is a constant antagonism existing between
interest and duty in every bosom.  Men's interests tell them  one
thing, and their duty another.  Interests are created by the necessities of the body and its propensities; and men, to supply these necessities, are compelled to smother conscience in the blackest clouds
of social warfare and conflicting interests.
One third of the earth's population are bound by the hand of disease, merely because they are uneducated, inferiorly conditioned, and
unjustly treated by the exclusiveness of classes and aristocracies

And this one third are also crushed by poverty, caused by ingenious
speculations on their labor. These come into being, live unhappy
and useless lives, and finally die, not knowing the destiny of their
creation.  They live, moreover, in a wilderness of pain, starvation,
and discontentment; and it is conspicuously true that physicians
never venture into that wilderness of despair!  They never explore
the regions of pain, distress, and wretchedness, because their interests
speak, and their steps are directed to the bed of the rich man, whose
wealth consists of the accumulated productions of that wilderness of
despairing and diseased beings!  Terrible indeed is the unrighteousness of these things: and they are truths that need unveiling,
though they will thrill the soul of every enlightened person with an
overwhelming conviction of their truth and importance!
The human race is afflicted with disease.  Mankind as a body are
sick, and need a physician.  They need effectual attention and permanent restitution to health, and energy, and happiness.  The race,
then, must be educated.  The rudiments of this education must consist in each one knowiing himself, in every anatomical and physiological particular; and then the world will not be cursed with ignorance,
vice, disease, and misery.  Then physicians will be useful and beneficial; for their time and talents will be concentrated in the great
work of social and moral reform, and their interests will not only
consist in the amount of health enjoyed, but in the destruction of
ignorance. violation, and local wretchedness.
~ 8. Of all professions and situations occupied by men, none is
absolutely more unenviable and more corrupting than that sustained
by CLERGYMEN.  It is a deplorable fact that all the miseries, the
conflicts, the wars, the devastations, and the hostile prejudices, existing in the world, are owing to the corrupting situation and influence of clergymen.  From the beginning of the human race to the
middle of this century, nothing has been more prominent than sectarian enthusiasm and theological warfare.  And from the lowest period
of the race, there have been successive modifications of clerical
power: but each modification has only contributed to consolidate the
error, and make the evil more impregnable. Clergymen have (like
other professional men) smothered their consciences in the gloomy
cloud of sectarianism.  They are all good in spirit, but unholy in
situation and influence.  And nothing can be more disgusting and

depressing, even to their own clouded judgments, than the unrighteousness proceeding from the influence they exert over an ignorant
and imbecile race.
Each clergyman, like the physician, is opposed to every new system of practice and model of profession.  Physicians do not countenance new modes and systems of practice, because this would be
stepping from the consolidated systems established by early generations.  And their system is so defended by a wall of Latin and insignificant terms, that no one can pass through and become initiated
without spending a large sum in some medical or technical institution.  The wall is so unsurpassable, that the majority of mankind
are obliged to remain on the outer, uninformed of their nature and
the paths that lead to health and happiness.  Tile clergymnan is still a
little more unfortunately situated, and is as effectually defended against
the invasion of natural intelligence, and the discoveries of any researcher into the truths of Nature and her God, that clergymen speak
of so much.  They also have a consolidated system of error —which
error, however, is concealed by the assumed cloak of " orthodoxy,"
which means " the right way." — But it is only the right way in one
sense, and that is to defend sectarianism against its foes!
Clergymen have a system of practice which is guarded by commentaries so vast, and sentinels so numerous, that the practice in
general can not be overthrown, or new systems be built up in its
stead.  They have not, however, succeededfitlly in this particular,
inasmuch as new systems of theological practice are being conceived
and instituted in nearly e'very generation.  The world at the present
day is a striking example of this truth.  It displays many systems of
sectarianism, and modes of curing the diseased soul. - And there are
also clergymen practising in each mode and system  of " salvation."
Some have more expedient and plausible ceremonies than others,
and such generally receive more patients; and in this way new sects
and new forms of sectarian prejudice are established.
Theirinterest consists in smothering the consciences of men, as
the physician's interest consists in general violation of the organic
laws.  If clergymen can have a general psychological ignorance
prevail, they are well pleased.  If they can have a general effeminacy and mental submission, then their occupation is prosperous and
their reward proportional.  If they can have a submissive sectarianism, and a moderate yet ignorant prejudice for exclusive sects, then
they entertain no fears as to the pe:lpetuation of their reward, and the

success of their professional enterprise.  Clergymen can not deny
that their interests consist in the prevalence of ignorance and secta.
rian prejudice, and not in free and unrestricted thoug-ht and theological investigation.  They are aware that the unrestricted exercise of
the mental powers would seal an everlasting destruction to all sectarianism, and consequently to their professions.  If the human mind
were free from the shackles imposed by prejudice, it would not rest
until every vestige of chimerical philosophy and theology was banished from the earth.  The clergyman's policy proclaims his consciousness of this fearful truth.  HIe shrinks childishly from the investigation, and strives to protect his situation by a more sanctimonious life, and a deeper devotion to the sectarian prejudices. of his
parishioners!
Previous research into the condition of man and society has denionstrated that man, having been well situated, amid many cultivations of his own industry, began to exercise his mental powers
on spiritual subjects, and upon the most profound mysteries. His
thoughts were at first confined to his social condition and to the
things near and about him that were pleasurable and profitable to the
requirements of the body. And after having removed all influences
that excited pain or displeasure, he lived happily, being abundantly
nourished by good and congenial productions.  Soon, however, the
mind deserted visible things, and soared in search of that beyond its
comprehension. -And what is remarkable is that the first adventurer
in celestial imaginations was a chieftain who was what at the present
day would be called a clegynman. He, like others after him, felt
inspired with novel conceptions, and, not perceiving their origin,
supposed they were divine.
From the first, these chieftains were adored as celestial teachers,
and true expounders of every (without them) inexplicable mystery.
It was found necessary to establish a distinction between those thus
elevated, and the enslaved admirer.  Moreover, it was deemed a virtue, and an evidence of divine religion, for the poor, depressed'
laborer to give all his super-productions to the priests and chieftains.
The priests, thus elevated and pauperously supported, exerted an influence over those beneath them, which established at once despotic
government and sectarian usurpation.
Clergymen have been so long engaged in their profession —in
perpetuating the primitive doctrines among the people, carefully pre

serving every mystery-and in establishing lines of demarcation between the good and evil in society- that the bright functions of reason
in them have become completely beclouded; and they feel conscientiously employed, and impelled by a sense of duty to continue to
promulgate their hereditary doctrines.  Their conceptions of duty
are at the present day moulded in their profession. Hence the most
brilliant mind, the most sensitive conscience, the most worthy man,
is pursuing his profession under the deepest convictions of a mysterious duty enjoined upon him. They feel it impossible to be mistaken in their work.  They feel that as the profession was established many centuries ago, it is no more than consistent with the
highest reason that it should be perpetuated.
Their interests consist in the prevalence of ignorance on psycho-'
logical subjects.  They are evidently conscious of this truth; for
when a new discovery is presented which is unfavorable to their
leading principles, they are impelled by a sense of duty and religious
interest, to defend their profession against such an unholy invasion.
It is with them as with the physician.- All new systems in his profession, all new discoveries and newly-invented medicines, he opposes;
for these are against'his interest and professional education.  The
success of any new medicine would reduce his practice, and conflict
with his prejudices.  So clergymen, in whatever situation they may
be placed, are anxious that new discoveries and truths should not
prevail, inasmuch as every new truth would convey a light into their
midst, which would reveal the hideousness of their corruption and
imbecility to a confiding world.
~ 9. From the influence of such ignorant despotism, the world is
thus disorganized, and existing amid conflicting elements of the most
corroding and corrupting character.  The clergy exert power over
the prejudices of every society throughout the world.  From  the
cradle their doctrines exert their influence; at youth they become instamped, and at manhood the mind is hampered witlh a confirmed
prejudice to some sectarian faith, and to some formal observance,
barren of benevolence.  The laborer, the mechanic, the tradesman,
the lawyer, and the physician, are all under the immediate control of
clerical influence; and all of them  yield to this influence as slaves
yield to the imperious commands of a potentate. Like the Medes
and Persians witlh reference to their secular laws, they dare not move
and raise their voice against the corrupting restrictions imposed by

the clergymen. For an open denunciation of them, or a serious expression of a conviction of any new and higher truths, would bring
down upon them the fearful threats of the religious profession, and it
would not be long before the general prejudice would crush them to
the earth.  Let any man speak sentiments irresistibly received, derogatory to the religion of the world, and the whole clerical army
would be arrayed against him.  All sects would instantly combine
their forces to repulse and crush the untrammelled mind! His voice
would be hushed, his influence would be arrested, and his benevolent teachings overwhelmed in the clouds of ignorance and religious
fanaticism!
When the laborer is nourishing the vegetation; when he is engaged in beautifying the earth and perfecting the harvest; in short,
when he is connected with the teachings of Nature and her requirements, he conceives of a benevolent Creator, who is good unto all,
and is no respecter of persons; and who, in his impartiality, has made
the same provisions for the Christian, the laborer, and the cannibal.
The experience of the poor man is more closely connected with
truth than that of any other, because he is constantly associating his
thoughts with Nature, her laws, and her evident bestowments upon
him.  His convictions are irresistible when free from the clergyman's
philosophy, or from any conventional doctrines. But when he leaves
the field and turns to society, his better convictions are instantly
crushed by the gloominess of the doctrines and impressions of the
theological world! He is not only subject to all the vicissitudes
of life, but to the contaminations of sectarian belief.  And if his natural convictions are too strong for the adnlission of sectarian doctrines, the clergyman beholds him  as an outcast, because he can
not believe his inconsistent teachings.  Nay, the clergyman would
smother what little hope he has derived from Reason, and throw
him and his family into consternation and despair. Being impelled
by interest, the clergyman seeks the laborer, and endeavors to rescue
his blemished soul from ultimate destruction.  He first tells the man
to believe. He questions the faith presented.  He is told it is a sin
to employ his " carnal reason" on such a subject.  He inquires what
to believe. The clergyman presents to his mind a profound mystery,
not surpassed by the invention of the Chaldeans or of the priests of
the Juggernaut! He discovers he can not believe.  Then the clergyman's hope for his salvation is lost. He utters a drawling invocation for the lost soul, and, for the especial consolation of himself and

family, deliberately consigns him  to an inviting gulf of unending
torment!
Clergyman, see what you have done, and behold your iniquity!
The man you have visited was unsophisticated by the corruptions of
sectarianism. He enjoyed his communions with Nature; for in her
lie saw the smiles of a divine Creator. But now he hesitates whether to return to his field of pleasure, or seek the dens of iniquity to
smother his disconsolation!  Behold, you have driven him to desperation! He no longer loves his neighbor, his family, or his nation. With indignation he curses the earth which gave him life, and
the God who exposed him to such fearful destruction! He curses
Nature, man, and Heaven; for all appear dark, and inconsistent with
what you have called "divine revelation."  See, then, how he flies
for refuge to the alehouse! And now his joys and sorrows are lost
in a stupor, while his body is obstructing the wayside! His joys
are buried in intoxication. His despair is drowned in insensibility.
His physical energies are lost-his forces are expended.  He has
violated every law of his being, and now, writhing in pain, he breathes
but a curse on society, and dies in degradation! His family are all
infected with the epidemic; and they, too, are distributed in the
asylum, in the prison, and in the grave!
Such examples have existed in every generation. And who has
caused this misfortune, and destroyed the natural enjoyments justly
belonging to this family in common with all men?
The mechanic, being engaged in his occupation, can not devote
his thoughts to the various causes existing in society that oppose his
happiness and contentment. So he labors intensely during the week,
deserts his business (which has become disgusting), and seeks the
sanctuary, to gain if possible some consolation to relieve his anxieties
and bless his existence. He is led by the clergy, and dares not to
think or speak that which they do not sanction. The minds of mechanics are generally enlightened concerning the rudimental principles of Nature and of mechanism, but they reason not concerning
the theology of their forefathers.  They are submissive to sectarian
restrictions, and are thus a mentally-enslaved though a worthy class
in society.
The tradesman is obliged to lull the admonitions of his conscience
into silence during the days of his business; for then he is compelled
by interest to invent all manner of deception in order to succeed in

his occupation.  Certainly he violates his duty by following his interests. He darkens his judgment by intensity of application. He,
however, can arouse his slumbering conscience when he enters the
sanctuary, and drink in every agreeable expression from the clergyman that would heal his wounded'conscience and encourage him to
proceed in his business.
The tradesman also contributes liberally to the support of local
sectarianism, and this secures hini a high seat in the synagogue; and
he is generally considered as one of the " elect." This, however, is
a matter of suspicion in his own mind, and even the clergyman dares
not reveal his deepest doubts.  The clergyman is thus obliged to
deceive those who hear him, merely that lie may be sustained in his
occupation. And so long as lie can procure submissive converts to
the mysteries which he promulgates, he is pleased; for this is one of
the manifestations the world requires of religious purity and prospective salvation.
Men go to church with their interests closed and their reason open.
They hear good and practical principles taught, and admire them.
They are told to love their neighbor, and do unto others as they desire others to do unto them. These are good and moral principles,
and men admire them.  But let them  return to their business, and
they find those principles impracticable; for they remember, the
maxim  of early tradesmen, that " lie who is Honest C(ma  1not sUCcCCd."
Hence mechanics, tradesmen, and lawyers, admire and preserve those
moral teachings in theory, but continue the old maxim in. practice.
Thus clergymen teach that which is good occasionally, but not
that which is practicable.  They tell what men should do with an eye
to their J)rofcssion, but are not willing to follow their own advice..
They will encourage the laborer, but shun labor.  They encourage
the mechanic, but have no sympathy for his occupation.  They advise the tradesman, but assist not in reforming  his unlioly situation.
They sanction the legal profession, but are deeply convinced of the
vitiated practice.  They admonish among themselves, and sometinles
disagree, but they are careful to preserve their p)rofcssion by strenuously opposing the light of knowledge.  They fear the electric fire
of intelligence, and shrinlk from its penetration.  They are conscious of their misty foundation, and of the innate barrenness of their
system.  Hence the torch of wisdom  is too bright, and the benevolence of the human heart is too expansive, for their contracted systenms
of religion.

5 10. Clergymen are exceedingly unfortunately situated.  They
deserve the sympathies of the whole world, while their occupation
should be changed as soon as possible. And their influence should
be tending to wisdom rather than ignorance, to benevolence rather
than restriction, to light rather than darkness, to Nature rather than
a book, and to God rather than the devil, who is at the present day
one of the most important personages engaged in sustaining and protecting their tottering systems against the invasions of natural morality
and human intelligence!
Clergymen have manufactured a theology whose author is a God
of inconceivable attributes, yet which are beneath the natural characteristics of man. The God whom they have invented is only a huge
human potentate, who is susceptible to pain and pleasure, to impulse
and reason, to justice and injustice, to exclusiveness and benevolence.
The devil whom they have manufactured is no less human except in
his anatomy.  His passions are as strong as their God's; his reason
and ingenuity are transcending, and his influence over the human
race is far more potent.  While the administration is divided between
them, the devil's is the greater; for the majority of mankind are supposed to court his presence, and finally to animate his illuminated
abode!
Here, then, are the creations of man: a God after his own image,
a devil after his own likeness, a theology after his own interest, and
a system of practice after his own prejudices!
Clergymen feel interested in the restriction and suppression of
thought; and in order to defend themselves against it, they call their
devil to their immediate assistance.  And by his influence the voice
of reason is hushed, their sanctuaries are filled, their financial depart-,ments are supplied, and their profession is tlrown into a flourishing condition.  Can you not, reader, perceive that you are compelled to love
their God because you are frightened by their devil? Can you not
see that your love is born of hate, and fear, and a mysterious consternation?  Can you not see that your thoughts are crushed, and
that the exercise of your reason is prohibited because it is called
carnal by the clergyman?  Do you not see that it is their interest that
prompts them to restrict the spontaneous aspirations of your bosom
for communion with Nature and Heaven? Do you not see that the
clergy are immorally situated, notwithstanding they profess the highesat morality and the highest spiritual enlightenment?

Reader, your interest consists in the free exercise of your nioral
and intellectual endowinents-in unrestricted inquiry and unceasing
intellectual progress.  Your happiness consists in the light, and unity, and happiness, of the whole world. Your interest consists in
being free as the mountain-air-in being as free to utter thoughts as
the sun is to bless the vegetation of the earth.  Your interests, then,
are opposed to the interests of the clergyman; for he restricts youir
inquiries, and strives to crush the spontaneous aspirations of your
benevolence. He tells you you must believe and move in the circle
which he has marked out. That circle is a mere denomination,
characterized by local hostility, apparent purity, and corrupting prejudices.  He binds you within that circle with the chains of sectarianism, which he locks with the key offiar, and attaches to a monument of imagination.  That circle is walled about with prejudice,
ecclesiastical tyranny, oppression, and despotism.  Only one gate is
open through which an escape may be effected, and there is stationed
-the devil!  He frowns as you approach, and you fly to the sanctuary
and the shepherd for protection! Reader, your interests are without; the clergyman's interests are withlin.  It is with you and your
convictions to decide whether a sectarian bondage shall oppress the
freeborn mind, or whether knowledge and universal happiness shall
bless the earth.
But there is one great consolation for the enslaved mind who ventures to escape through the gate of this great sectarian wall and city
- and to enjoy this consolation, remember that the chain which binds
you, with its lock, is only fcatr; the monument only imagiination,
and the satanic gate-keeper only a sectarian phantom!  Nothing,
then, prevents your escape.  Press onward! —and after you lhave
gained the field of Nature, raise your thouglhts to Him whose essence
is love, and whose wisdom  is universal justice, benevolence, and
reciprocation!
Clerical and sectarian despotism encompasses the inhabitants of
the earth.  Like a mantle it extends over all nations; and thus the
world is in bondage, not knowing the kingdom of heaven, which is
peace on earth and good-will to men. Prejudices are so enstamnped
upon every being that the world is in a confused condition.  Men
approach each other only as their prejudices coalesce.  This is following too much the inclinations of the body, and not the directions

first admit, through fear, the teachings of their chieftain, potentate, or
clergyman, and finally cherish the faith which they have adopted with
great affection, and are ready at all times to defend it by bitter anathemas and unholy denunciations of their neighbors. Men are first
deceived, and then delight, as it were, in conscientiously deceiving
others.  After they have admitted a faith, whether congenial with
their reason or not, they feel anxious to sustain what they have adopted.  Hence there exist in society religious strife, contention, and
prejudice.  Every nation has all these combined; and they are manifested whenever approached or invaded by an antagonism.
~ 11. Reader, suppose yourself among the followers of Mohammed.
Wander forth into the desert, and there lift your voice against the
Koran.  If you wish to see the sectarian Genius, just utter these
words: " I disbelieve the Koran;" and behold in the distance a dark
and fearful cloud, from which is emerging a chariot drawn by infuriated steeds, and in which is seated a huge, gigantic form, whose
countenance is as black as midnight, and whose garments are the
wealth of nations.  See! it approaches with a frightful speed.  By
its side is seated a darling child whose name is Ignorance; and on
the brow of tYhat huge monster is written in characters of fire"Mohammnedanismn"!  It rushes by, bearing down nations in its
course.  War and persecution are its attendants, and misery, desolation, and ruin, complete the train: while over the whole is waving
the flag of fanaticism; and beneath, blood is as a river!
That form has departed.  The desert is clear, and you are deserted.  Reader, meditate upon the cause of all this, and give forth
your convictions to the world.  Was it not by denouncing the Koran
that you excited the prejudices of the nation, which in return breathed
wrath, ruin, and indignation?  And was not that prejudice an attribute of the great Genius of sectarianism, established and sustained by
a religious chieftain? Did you not see how earnestly the nation engaged in crushing and arresting your thoughts?  And was not this
because they considered you an enemy to what they call truth and
religion?  Think of these causes, and let reason display her verdict
to the world.

Supply every natural want-every passion for which food is there

army of infuriated and exasperated clergymen, armed with spears of
indignation and battle-axes of- Christian purity!  Their steps are
hurried, their movements confused, and their countenances darkened
with fear, while their mouths proclaim, " Think no evil."  See how
they march and erect a battery of commentaries, and prepare for
battle! How strange that every one is arnled so differently! Each
one has his peculiar mode and plan of fighting, yet they all combine
and are arrayed against you. Behold again! Just as they were
prepared to demolish you and your thoughts, a disturbance sprang
up in their midst; and see what a wretched confusion is presented!
Instead of fighting you, they are quarrelling and fighting with each
other; and what is stranger than all is that their firearms do not perform their office!  Now they are again at peace in those portions
where the confusion was created, and. they are again prepared to fire
a volley upon you. Alas for your reputation, your happiness, your

The war is over; you have fought the good fight; you stood alone
-and are unharmed!  And now that all is clear, and the fields of
science and knowledge are blooming before you with beauty and
living happiness, you can repose and( contemplate the strength of
that power which preserved you. You now perceive on reflection
that you were clothed with a garment through which their spears and
bolts of sectarianism could not enter.  What was that garment?Reader, with delight you exclaim,' IT WAS IMMORTAL TRUTH!"
A religious strife and party antagonism  has pervaded the earth
ever since the early stages of the human race; and each successive
generation has only modified and confirmed the previous doctrines,
until at the present day there exists a universal discord.  This discord is owing to the promulgation of doctrines heretofore conceived,
to the exclusion of all others, or of new truths that would enlighten
the world. Among the early nations a distinction of classes was
made by those who directed their religious sentiments and governed
their thoughts.  These were chieftains, who were supposed to exert
a mysterious influence over the subjects under their respective dominions.  In all ages and countries this sectarian distinction has been
the most prominent feature in society; and this is at the present day
engendering new and more corrupting prejudices.-And all this is
the work of popes, bishops, rulers, and clergymen.
Some men have conceived that it is their privilege to exercise
their reason, and believe whatever it sanctions: but those who have
conceived this truth are compelled to smother it for the want of an
atmosphere of light and liberty.  Such men are also compelled to
arrest their thoughts, and confine their influence to a limited circle,
because sectarian hostility and local prejudices cloud the atmosphere
of free thought, and render their existence dark, dreary, and uncongenial.
There are nations upon the earth so shackled with the chains of
sectarianism imposed by religious and despotic governors, that they
are obliged to think only what their priests permit, and thus are
slaves to religious tyranny and fanaticism.  No one among them
dares to express the deepest convictions of his judgment; for before
him is erected the fearful prison, the rack, and the stake, around
which consuming flames are created, to compel submission and arrest the thoughts of his freeborn mind! Inquisitions, then, are recognised as a form of converting souls to religion and love to one

another!  It is known that in generations past these inhuman tortures were imposed by apostle-endowed chieftains —whose business it was to rule the people and compel submission, if not by enslaving mandates, then more effectually by the rack or the boiling
caldron.  It is certainly not natural for the human mind to be converted to religion by lacerating and disorganizing the body —much
less to be made to love the pope and his commands by being burned
or boiled into submission.
~ 12. The mussulman is seriously devoted to the teachings of his
chieftain, and deliberately denounces all dissenters as infidels and
unconverted beings. He has a prophet whose life is clothed with
miracles, whose teachings are unsurpassed for mystery, and whose
whole career has never been equalled.  The mussulman can appeal
to the miraculous power of _Mohammed, and on its authority he demands conviction and faith firom others.  He tells you that his inspired lawgiver traversed the sun and its brilliant atmosphere without
casting a shadow, and deliberately separated the moon with a knife,
and traversed ninety heavens in one night, on an animal that was one
half woman and one half horse!  The mussulman will tell you that
you must visit Mecca once in your life, give one tenth of all you
have to the priest, and that by so doing you will escape an ocean of
inconceivable flames, by passing over an enormous bridge, whose
immensity almost exceeds that of one human hair!-and that thus
you will finally dwell in heaven for ever, where all good mnussulmelt
will preserve an eternal youth! No miracles can be more inexplicable than these; none more inconsistent with the laws of Nature;
and, reader, you do not believe them: for they are written in the
Koran by Mohammed, and in the productions of his followers!
But remember you have also a book that proclaims mysteries
almost as inconsistent, and them you believe!  Reflect one moment,
and you will discover that the mussulnian disbelieves the claims of
your religion, and its miracles, because it is written in the Bible, and
that by authors unknown.  The mussulman calls you an "infidel
dog" with great self-complacency, and with a serious approbation of
conscience; while you reciprocate the favor by calling him an iGn20rant Arab, having no hope or light in the world!

exclusive sectarian faith.  All are seriously convinced, and all are as
seriously deceived.
War, and bloodshed, and cruelty, and persecution, are all the
legitimate effects of sectarian usurpation and priestly government.
Clergymen are indeed most unrighteously situated.  Their influence
is corrupting to the morals established immutably in Nature, and the
distributive benevolence contained in the constitution of Nature's
God.  Men who are laboring to reform  the race by destroying all
sectarian distinction, are sanctimoniously opposed by the theological
shepherds of the land, who profess to be teachers of the highest morality, and advocates of the most universal reformation.  Let one
fiee mind express his convictions, and the clergy of the land piously
denounce him as an " infidel dog," tile same as the mussulman would
denounce the clergy.  Inconsistent indeed are the social and general
conflicts arising firom sectarianism, with the teachings of Nature and
her divine requirements.  For the clergy teach that exclusiveness
whereby sectarianism is preserved, and religious hostility is enrgen(lered, whose fruits are local disunity and social confusion.  Even
domestic happiness is- turned to misery, and the affections of parents
and children, and brothers and sisters, are all crushed and disunited.
They no longer love each other, for the clergy have mlade them
tirots!
Reader, have you a companion?  If so, when the day arrives to
visit the sanctuary, do you not, after having enjoyed years oft social
bliss and domestic Ilappiness, walk side by side from your dwelling,
and separate on the corner of some highway, and go to different temples of worship? Are you not united at your peaceful homes, and
in everything but the religious impressions of your youth, and their
confirmations to your minds?  Do you not separate and seek different modes and sanctuaries of worship?  At the same time, do you
not withdraw friendship and affection fiom  each other, and are you
not in your spiritual predilections disunited by a wall of partition
built by the sectarianism of the land?  And was not that wall established by the clerical profession?  And have they not told you that
you should forsake each other, your homes, your country, your companions and children, for the sake of a more strict devotion to what
they teach you to consider as a holy and righteous life?
Families should be as one in their search after truth, and their
obedience to the morality of Nature; but instead of this, families are
fearing to approach each other, because of their religious convictions!

The son, surrounded by different circumstances from those surrounding the father, is impressed with a different religious doctrine, and
therefore a dread of the presence of each other is created between
them; and they are no longer congenial or affectionate.  The mother,
too, is opposed to the father, and the daughters are in like manner
thrown into confusion, and no longer love each other with the same
strength of affection that previously bound them in peace together.
Society is thus disorganized, both in its general and particular departments.  The corrupting influence of clergymen extends to families, to all the professions of the day, and to all the governments;
and consequently the whole race is as a flock of sheep whose direction is undefined and whose relations are no longer congenial.  This
condition of society will exist so long as the clergyman's interest
consists in the prevalence of ignorance on psychological subjects,
and the general testimonies of Nature.  Their interests must be
changed so as to be in favor of knowledge and intellectual progression. Their influence will then be elevating, and their position in society will be both useful and industrial. They must be made to feel the
importance of unrestricted inquiry into the causes of evil, and of a
general investigation of all principles that govern Nature and man
with an unerring government.  They must understand and cherish
those principles, and apply their teachings to the necessities of society-and thereby establish a morality that is as indestructible as the
laws that govern the Universe.  Thus they will improve the race;
and this will bring happiness and peace.

and of the Juggernaut?-of the origin of Catholicism and of Protestantism, which at the present day are exercising their omnipotency
over the societies and nations under their respective influences?
What is the cause of all this dissimilarity, this confusion, war, persecution, fanaticism, and religious intolerance?  What is the cause of
even families separating, and their members despising each other?
WVhat is the cause of poverty, of vice, and of all infractions upon the
physical and moral laws of human nature?  What is the cause of
aristocracy, and pride, and arrogance?  What is the cause of the
fiendish exultations of one man or one sect over the destruction or
unsuccess of another?  What is the cause of your prejudices, and
why do you tremble and shrink from  investigation?   Reader,
speak and proclaim the causes of these. Fear the firown of no
legal practitioner.  Smile at the stake and flame.  Face the rack
unmoved: fear not the rod of persecution, for truth and purity will
protect you.  Speak boldly and fearlessly your earnest and serious
convictions: and Nature will smile upon you with her divine approbations; the angels will rejoice, and the Divine Mind will bless your
mind with celestial knowledge.  Fear no clerical practitioner (for
they, like the physician and lawyer, have various modes of practising),
for although he may be well versed in the learning of his profession,
he can not quell the testimonies of a divine Nature, or the corresponding convictions of a noble mind!
The clergyman may become more devoted to his denomination,
and assume a more sanctimonious countenance, but, reader, remember that the external is not the reality, and that the inside of the
platter may be full of extortion and excess! New councils may be
organized, and new conventions called. Fearful resolutions may be
passed, and solemn prayers may be offered for your destruction, and also
your salvation.  But remember those prayers are sometimes the spontaneous desires of misdirected passion. -And, moreover, remember
that homage is done to the Divine Mind, not in prayer and unmeaning supplication, but in harmonious industry and universal ACTION

T'heory may be the profession of some, but lnractice must be the

The lines of sectarian distinction are so visibly drawn in families,
societies, states, and nations, that the whole world can not fail to perceive them, and freely admit their deleterious and corroding influence
upon true and divine morality.  Nation wars with nation; and one
subdues the other and confiscates its most precious wealth, such as
gives to nations honor, and to their cities elegance and beauty. And
the destruction by one nation of the wealth and existence of another,
is from the impulse of local prejudice and religious usurpation. So
likewise is society divided into castes, groups, exclusive sects, denominations, and institutions, all of which inculcate different principles of faith and morality.  The influence of these extends also into
the bosom of families and divides their members one from another.
All of these national wars have sprung legitimately from local impressions disseminated by the clerical profession.  These various
sects and institutions in society are also living offspring of the same
parent; for each one of them is an open expression of sectarian
affection, and love of party distinction and aristocracy.
Ask the poor man whether the sympathies of the higher classes
are extended to him in his inferior condition? Ask the traveller who
has deserted friends and home, whether he meets with sympathy in
society, or finds a general willingness to supply his wants? And
ask the mechanic, also, whether he can move in the higher circles,
or whether they descend to and favor him with their smiles and approbation?-or whether he is not rather shunned and unnoticed by
him who has his footmen in livery, and whose coffers are filled with
the products of the laborer's and mechanic's industry? In the present order of things, one man desires to gain, if possible, the ascen,

to accumulate more wealth, so that he, thus defended against poverty,
may look down upon him who labors with a species of triumph and
exultation not worthy of an existence in the human breast.
~ 14. In every nation, there exists to some degree the same exclusiveness and the same depression and bondage.  This exclusive,
sectarian, and prejudicial feeling, is created by the clerical practitioners; for they preach the doctrines of partiality even in the nature of
the Divine Mind. They, with an audacity unparalleled, call a class
of their brethren "sinners," while those under their immediate influence are esteemed as "the righteous," or "the elect."  They have
established two distinct classes in society, which they call "good"
and "evil."  Those who are good (in their sight) are admonished
to spurn the evil and degraded, and to leave them to their sinks of
desolation.  Thus he who is called evil becomes exasperated, and,
for the sake of retaliation, seeks an unrestrained indulgence in his
own animal inclinations.  Thus a distinction is created by the clergy,
the influence of which fills the prison, and gives employment to the
legal profession and to the hangman!  It also establishes prostitution, fills the almshouse and the asylum, casts the poor upon society
uncared for, causes them to forsake their home and friends, and go
down to the grave through the paths of misery, despair, and intoxication!
Clergymen create this distinction.  They draw a line between
good and evil, and, with an apostolic license, consign one class to
the regions of darkness, wretchedness, and pain, while the other is
elevated to the highest seat in the celestial heaven, to have their enjoyments enhanced by contemplating the miseries of damned souls!
So long as there exists a sectarian distinction between good and evil,
so long will war, persecution, ignorance, vice, misery, and degradation, exist.  Meanwhile there will be the self-righteous, the self-sanctified, the " born again," and the religious hypocrite, whose imperfections will be obscured from the gaze of natural eyes by a cloak of
gorgeous wealth and pretended piety.  So long as sectarian interpretations are confided in, so long will governments continue to be exclusive in their enactments and privileges.  And with them the church
will coalesce, and thus confirm a most unrighteous despotism which
will enslave and corrupt the morals of society, and misery will everywhere raise her hideous head, weeping in anguish unutterable!

Party prejudice and isolated denominations will remain and enslave society so long as the clergyman's interest tells him to preserve
ignorance and repress the light of knowledge.  A latent cupidity is
generated by their profession, which penetrates through all the recesses of society and pervades the whole nation. Nay, it is self and
universally deceptive.-And this, too, is the offspring of clerical
policy, and the first-born of Ignorance and Hypocrisy.
Most deplorable is the state of society all over the world!  Every home is desolate of that pure morality which recognises all as
brethren, and barren of those elevating principles which are taught
by Nature as the laws of God.  Every denomination " knows" that its
own doctrines are right, and each one is earnestly engaged in denouncing and exposing others; and thus strife and sectarian warfare are
perpetuated.: And who are the champions of the battle?  Are they
not the theological gladiators, who exert an influence on your minds
and affections while claiming to be teachers of peace and divine p2u-'ity?  Are these not the shepherds of the land, whose flocks are
the societies over which they preside?  But alas! the flock is sheared
of their wealth and the fruits of their industry, and that, too, to support an army of useless and injurious persons in splendor and elegance.  For such men are useless in their present occupation -even
injurious to the peace and health of community.  How much therefore do they need the sympathies of the world, who at the same time
should strive to chlange their situations and render them useful to the
human race!
So long as clergymen preach distinction, so long will vice exist;
and so long as they array the mind of the community against the
free exercise of the mental faculties, so long will prejudice remain,
and mankind will continue to despise and abhor each other.  So
long as men presume to say, " I am holier than thou," so long will
bigotry and fanaticism continue to destroy the happiness of mankind.
So long as clergymen continue to say, with their usual application
of the language, "' The good shall be on the right, and the evil upon
the left," so long will a corruption continue to prevail in society, and
so long will local hostility clothe the beauties of Nature with blood
and carnage.  So long as men preach truths and not practise or assist others to practise them, so long will there exist a degeneracy in
the moral condition of the race which all preachers and systems can
not regenerate and make perfect.
As society is existing, it is imrpossible for a man duly to love his

neighbor, or to feel an interest in the universal elevation of the race.
Nor can one do unto others as he would have others do unto him,
for every law and sectarian doctrine opposes, and therefore the interest of every man is in direct opposition to such a manifestation of
benevolence.  Men may preach to the race and exhort them all to
be happy, while they do nothing to accomplish this end, and while
it is plain that every circumstance opposes such a universal peace.
But as well might the clergy preach to the great river with the intention of arresting its tide or changing its course-or to the vegetation
of the earth, that it may come forth in all seasons and under all circumstances alike-or tell the black man that it is with him to say
whether his color shall remain as it is, or whether he shall become
white —or tell the poor man that he may be wealthy at pleasure —
or the rich man that he may be good or evil at will. In all of these
teachings the clergyman would fail to accomplish the thing for which
he labored. For it is impossible for men to be moral and good when
all influences are corrupting and vitiating-or for men to be evil
when all influences are elevating and purifying. Nay, clergymen
should learn this truth: that mankind can not be what they would at
pleasure, in any possible particular; for they are existing from birth
to the grave amid uncontrollable circumstances, such as are being
created by every profession, every government, and every hereditary
impression upon the physical and mental constitution of man. Moreover, clergymen must learn that these circumstances, which govern
the world, are the creations of man, and that he possesses power to
seal their everlasting destruction, and to create superior ones in their
stead, to bless his existence.  Therefore it is more than folly to proclaim that which is absolutely impracticable, from the pulpit to a race
misled by the circumstances of their own creation.  AIen should not
cherish prejudices against each other, so long as the sun shines to
bless the earth and all men, and while the laws of Nature are unchangeable and ever impartial in their displays.
~ 15. One portion of the earth is called a " Christian land."  It
is thought to be blessed with celestial truths that no other country
enjoys; and this is the constant saying of those who are most engaged in the promulgation of sectarian doctrines.  But, reader, in
this " Christian land" exists error consolidated and sublimated; and
there is also inherent hostility that would burst out and flow over the
nation were it not for the freedom guarantied to the public mind, and

the political privilege of unrestricted thought. These considerations
are startling, but they are true, and are evidently demonstrated in
every department of society in that civilized land.
A more conspicuous manifestation of intolerance is. yet to come:
for behold yon chapel, and enter it, and listen to what is said. Every seat is filled, and all look to the pulpit with emotions of awe and
fear! All are silent, and each one is seemingly in deep meditation.
Just now one arises and remarks to the audience as follows:
"Perhaps many of you have heard of the audacity and boasting
presumption of one in our community who has professed to work
miracles, and to reveal truths which we know are false and damning," &c.
Reader, this man is followed by another man by his side, whose
looks indicate age, and  countenance erudition.  HIis deportment
reveals his superficial enlightenment, and his general appearance
bespeaks devotion and seriousness.  He now addresses the audience, saying:"Many of you, my beloved, have read and heard it said, that in
the last days false prophets will arise; that they will be as wolves in
sheep's clothing, professing to do many marvellous things, thereby
endeavoring to corrupt the people of God.  Lately such a one has
appeared.  He is sowing the seeds of disunity, corruption, and infidelity, in the world; and it becomes us as Christians and righteous
men to spurn this teacher, and reject all disseminators of his errors,
from our tables of communion and from a seat in our sanctuary.
For, my beloved, it is written that' false Christs and false prophets
shall arise and show great signs and miracles, insomuch that, if it
were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.' My beloved friends,
how strikingly the prophecy is fulfilled even at this day, among us!
Let us strenuously oppose the invasions of all such anti-Christian
principles, by meeting frequently, and invoking the strength of our
God, who will visit such deceivers with a consuming vengeance!
And let us repulse this man's sayings from our families, lest they
pollute the rising generation, and thus damn their souls for ever."
Reader, this speaker has concluded, and is again seated. —And
now do you see the audience delighting and exulting among themselves that they have overcome the spirit of the evil one?  See with
what an air of circumspection they arise and depart. They approach
their homes and retire, each having a misty impression upon his
imind, the cause of which he perceives not. and is thus deceived. Be

lieving that their devotion to the teachings of their clergyman is pu —
rity and safety of soul, and believing that what they have heard is all
truth, they are hence qfraid to see what their clergyman denounces
as error.
Such are and will be the manifestations of clerical influence in
this " Christian land."  Certainly if it were not distinguished by the
term "Christian," no one would suspect it of Christianity.  So indeed it is with those who are converted to any sectarian faith. They
call themselves "rightcous;" and were it not for this expression,
their nearest neighbors would have no knowledge of their righteousness. In almost every instance, the most safely-converted are obliged
to tell the fact before a person in community is aware of it.  Is it
not strange that men are " born again" so mysteriously, and yet their
fiiends discover no visible change in their deportment?
Then what are men converted to?  It is to sectarian prejudices;
to a mysterious faith; to an undefinable impression, and to an open
enmity to their unconverted brother without the denomination of
which they are members.  They are converts to sectarianism, then,
and not to divine morality; converts to prejudice, and not to thefrece
and unrestrained exercise of the spiritual faculties; converts to exclusiveness, and not to universal benevolence; converts to a mysterious
faith, and not to the open revealments of Nature, which is an expressed thought of the Deity!
Mien are thus self-deceived, and they are constantly suspecting
others of practising deception.  They perceive that they are constantly being deceived themselves, and hence are compelled to deceive others.  Such men often become misanthropists, and ultimately
forsake society, because they are suspicious of its purity and disgusted
with its conflicting elements.
Clergymen, what are the causes engaged in producing and perpetuating these things?  What are the causes of " evangelical" distinctions, and the belief that one is evil and the other is good?
What are the causes of these disunities in society?  What were the
causes of the crucifixion, the inquisition, the crusades, and of the
martyrdom  of good and enlightened men?  What were the causes
of the massacre of St. Bartholomew?   Vhat are the causes of war,
devastation, and national poverty?  Why do men in each nation
love their own local associations and despise all others?  Why are
vice and misery existing?-and why are ignorance, prejudice, and
restriction of thought?  Why are you, clergymen, fearing that the

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    721
"carnal reason" will discover too much truth-?  Why do you arld
monish your hearers not to think or read much on subjects of a high
and elevating character?
Clergymen, consider these interrogatories? Remember the world
requires a full and candid decision; and remember, too, that language is inadequate to express the importance of these questions, and
their answers. If you do not candidly decide for the world, the
world will for you ere long; and then your situations will be changed:
your influence will be arrested, and your personal existences made
useful.  And then if you will not cheerfully consent to be happy,
you will be compelled to breathe happiness, by your unceasing industry, to the inhabitants of the whole earth.
~ 16. " What!" you exclaim, " would you have us abandon our
spiritual efforts to elevate the degraded, and to reform a sinful race?
Would you have us withdraw our sympathies from this great work
of spiritual reformation, and desert the requirements of men, that they
may become more evil and contaminated? Would you have us
desert our sanctuaries and temples of holy worship, consecrated to)
God and his divine revelation, and open the floodgates of infidelity,
that this may drown the religious world and desolate the earth?
Would you have us sanction unrestricted investigation concerning
that of which men are ignorant-the effect of which would be universal presumption and blasphemy?  Would you have us arrest our
benign labors in the great spiritual vineyard, and leave all the vines,
and flowers, and shrubbery, to wither and decay? Have. we not
visited the widows and fatherless in their afflictions, shed tears overand prayed for them, invoking the blessings of our Father to rest
upon thein and bless their existence?  Have we not mourned for
the condition of the poor and necessitated?  Have we. not encour-.
aged them  by offering the balm of Gilead to their woundedi and
lacerated bosoms?  Have we not proclaimed from our pulpits —-'Blesse1 are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted:' blessedare the peace-makers, for they shall see God'?  Hav.e we not offered'
hope, and rest, and consolation, to the barren bosom:?: Have we
not unfolded the blessings of heavenly bliss, and' specifically pointed
out the strait and narrow way that leads unto eternalilife.?  Behold.
these things," you again exclaim, and ask, " Are we not most impi —
ously misrepresented?  For our labors have. beeni unceasing., we
have suffered deprivations and perils by sea, and' land.  We have

deserted our friends and homes, and travelled as missionaries to foreign lands, to instruct and inform the poor heathen of his imminent
danger, and of the means to escape it? We have made an estimate
of the saved and lost souls among them.  We have come to the
conclusion that fifty thousand are sinking to hell every day!  This
mathematical calculation we have presented to an enlightened and
Christianized world, and called upon them to bestow means for our
support, that we may labor for these poor, ignorant, and abandoned
souls.  We have missionaries distributed in every portion of the
earth, seriously and incessantly devoted to their appointed labors.
They suffer cruelties and persecutions of the most inexpressible
character. They forego all pleasure and experience all pain, that
they may accomplish the great work of spiritual reformation."  With
surprise you again exclaim, "Would you have us withdraw our
sympathies from the heathen, and leave them to irretrievable destruction?"
Then, again, you say, " You misunderstand our holy religion, and
call it' manuJfictured,' while we know it is an express revelation from
God to man.  The effects of our holy religion (as you informed your
readers) are evidently righteous, from the great dissimilarity between
the heathen and Christian nations. The Hindoos are exceedingly
ignorant.  They have long pilgrimages; they expose themselves to
imminent danger —prostrate themselves in the sand, and let men
and horses walk over them; they crawl upon their hands and knees,
and draw themselves, with the most idolatrous veneration, toward the
iemple of Juggernaut.  The ponderous car of their heathen god rolls.over and crushes their bodies. They undergo all this with a confidence in, and devotion to, their religion, unparalleled by any nation,upon the earth. And when a loved husband dies, an altar is erected,,on which he is placed, and the widow is obliged to accompany the
dead body as a sacrifice on the burning pile.  The babes are placed
-with their parents; the torch is applied, and the consuming flame
destroys the living with the dead! — And all this because they have'not the Christian religion!  Then," you say again, "reflect —for
-the whole heathen world are like these in their sensuous devotion to;a polluted and unmeaning system of idolatry."
You also refer to the heathen philosophers, and point out their infamous iniquities.  You represent that their morals were debasing
to the lowest degree; that all principles of virtue were crushed; that
all privileges enjoyed by the female sex were restricted; that their

chastity was polluted, and their existence rendered miserable. You
say that no teacher ever lived who promulgated the same morality,
virtue, and high principles of celestial purity, as those who penned
the book whose truths you proclaim firom your pulpits and in your
sanctuaries of divine worship and moral instruction.
Again, you say, "Our labors are misinterpreted, and our high
calling improperly spoken of: for behold what our religion has
done!  On emerging from the heathen into the Christian world, we
perceive wealth, wisdom, and happiness, distributed in every direction.  Well-constructed and opulent cities, governed by our principles of morality, are visible, and happy villages are blessing the land,
whose lofty spires bespeak Christian purity and a righteous nation.
Every art is cultivated; every privilege is granted tending to advance
the agriculturist in his pursuits; every facility is offered for establishing and perfecting navigation of all descriptions, and all modes of
expedite travel.  Every man has the fieedom  of his own mind,
thoughts, and sentiments, except the black man, who is in slavery,
because slavery is sanctioned by our religion. And behold the
wealth and,prosperity of the American nation! Everything in its
possession has flourished from the beginning, and continues to thrive,
with all the blessings a nation can desire.  See, then, what our religion-our principles-our high calling-has done for the'civilized nations of the earth! -And in view of all this, you rise in
rebellion against our efforts and our profession!  You misinterpret
our most holy intentions, our deepest yearnings, and our serious
devotion to the principles of morality and of human improvement!"
The voice of Nature replies: Abandon your present, but establish
n7cw efforts, whereby the social world may harmonize, and morality
bloom as a rose, from the superior situations of mankind. Do not
cultivate the flower of morality, before you have planted the seed of
human industry. Do not begin at the top of a building, before you
have laid its foundation in the earth.  Open the floodgates of infidelity to all the useless and unlrig-htcous professions of the age, and thereby
establish a fidelity to the indestructible laws of Nature, and to her
divine morality.  Cease your mourning for the widow and the fatherless, and go forth and labor to supply their necessities.  Cease
your long and unmeaning prayers and invocations, and honor the
God of your being by laboring in the vineyard of a fertile earth, and
thereby bless your own and your neighbor's existence, with abundance and happiness. An instance can not be shown in which a

sigh has healed the injured breast, or a prayer has given food to the
hungry.
Brethren, you mean well, but your labors are useless and impoverishing to the human race. You repose unlimited confidence in
the Divine Mind and his providence toward his creatures —and you
ire anxious to have your Father in heaven do that which you can
do yourselves.  You call for assistance when you are depressed with
the afflictions of those around you. Your supplications are pure,
but alas! they are unavailing-; because, clergymen, though you are
seriously you are immorally employed!
~ 17. Moreover, learn this truth: that morality is not in your systems of religion, but is immoveably established in Nature and in Man;
and if you desire to elevate the race, strive to establish conditions
adapted to its proper development.  Verbal prayers are insignificant,
ineffectual, and unprofitable.-But every true and righteous prayer
consists in an unchanging devotion to the principles of Nature, and
the teachings of a benevolent Father.  Then pray in actions and in
deed, but not with your tongue, though seriousness may prompt the
utterance.  Be religiously devoted to practice, and not to theory.
Tell no more what men should do, but go forth and assist them to
do it.
The voice of Nature replies again, that your system and profession
are not misrepresented: for in them  }re concealed the elements of
evil and disunity. —For behold how much the more devotedly the
Hindoo is attached to his religion, because he hates yours!  He despises your sanctimonious offerings, and repulses all your missionary
innovations.  It is this antagonism that retards his abandonment of all
heatllenish and idolatrous worship.  He beholds other nations smothcred in a sectarian faith imposed by a God he knows not. Thus he
loathes and despises them.  Heathens thus centre their affections in,
and restrict their thoughts to, the deified principles of their speechless god-and all this to manifest an increased devotion by way of
retaliation upon all Christian invaders and mysterious teachers.
The heathen philosophers taught some good, but more evil. They
believed all they taught to be the highest morality, but as they descended into sensuous observation, they drew conclusions that were
both erroneous and impure. Their minds had just emerged from an
immense ocean of ignorance and fanaticism; and they rushed impetuously to the indulgence of unrestrained animal gratification.  Their

wisdom was uncultivated; their perceptions were acute, but theit:moral faculties were undeveloped.
Between these two extremes sprang up the modified and rationa.
system contained in the book which you, clergymen, are promulgating. Hence this book contains more real and useful principles
than any collection of manuscripts on the earth.  Those who wrote
them %were enlightened, because the extremes of the heathen ignorance and philosophy were an unfailing index from which central
and useful truths could be deduced. Nothing is contained in these
manuscripts but what is of the highest importance to the human race;
and this is especially true of those portions indicating the morality
derivable from universal industry and reciprocal justice.  They are
plain-all can read them —they need no expounding. They are
intended as incentives to an end which all should be employed to
accomplish —even love to the neighbor, and peace on earth, and
good-will to men. Preaching will never effect this: action will accomplish it in a brief period.
The voice of Nature again replies, that the effects of your system,
and of its promulgation, have not been righteous.  But how is this
to be proved?  Is not the distinction evidently visible between the
heathen and the Christian world?-and can it be denied that Christianity has produced the great elevation of the one, which renders the
degradation of the other conspicuous?
Reader, in the distance a form is visible. —It is an aged man,
whose countenance indicates purity and benevolence of soul. He
seems like one of the primitive inhabitants. His pace is slow and
firm; his form is well proportioned; and with a smile upon his countenance, he approaches you. Just inquire of him concerning his
birth and experience, and concerning his knowledge of the heathen
and civilized nations-and of the causes engaged in producing the
manifest dissimilarity between them.
In answer to your question, he replies that he is an Anglo-Saxon;
that he is acquainted with the causes of civilization, and can give you
some wholesome advice, so that you may recognise and perpetuate
the causes, that their effects may hereafter be more conspicuous.
Listen, now, while the venerable man utters his experience:-' From-the beginning, man had necessities, which he labored to
supply. His increasing wants led to the development of his physical
and mental attributes; and this enabled him to accomplish many useful inventions.  Impulsed by a powerful desire, lie perpetuated his

species, not knowing the wisdom of this purpose of Nature. Eacl;
new being, however, was made useful in tilling the earth. Natural
desires were gratified, social requirements abundantly supplied, and
man's domestic happiness was in a measure complete from his own
industry, invention, and development.
"It was not long after this period that man launched his mind on
the ocean of imagination! Having no wisdom  as a helm to guide
his thoughts, he ran upon shoals and bars, and among icebergs, rocks,
islands, and strange regions, until, alas! his mind, like a vessel, stranded upon the beach of a dark and gloomy philosophy, from which
theology had its birth.
" The nations thereafter continued their physical improvements
and industry, meanwhile cherishing and fostering the various remnants of the mental wreck which constituted their peculiar modes of
chimerical and imaginative worship. Each succeeding generation
confirmed the opinions of the preceding ones, until the various nations were prejudiced and infatuated, being devotedly attached to
their peculiar idols and forms of religious veneration.  They sacrificed their lives, their homes, and their peace, in defence of their religion.  Sectarian hostility raged like a consuming fire throughout
the earth, which led to the invention of warring implements, and of
all, plans of personal and national destruction.  The moral and social
faculties of man were crushed and perverted.  Their little wisdom
was turned to ingenuity and deception - their affections to bitterness
and vindictive vengeance. Then it was that the whole world was
divided by the walls of sectarian envy and religious fanaticism.
The heathen, exasperated, fought those who were more fortunately
situated, and apparently blessed with a better God and a better religion.  Those who had cultivated their intellectual faculties, and
abundantly supplied their physical necessities, founded cities characterized by wealth and splendor; and they believed that their God
caused this prosperity, and not themselves.  With this conviction,
they rushed against and strove to subdue the heathens and their systems of social government and religious devotion.  In this manner,
nation after nation was destroyed, and new ones were established.
Each nation was as a sect; each dominion as an exclusive world;
and each one pointed the sword of vengeance at its neighbor's
breast. Men became so suspicious of each other, that forts, and
castles, and monasteries, were erected, and cities were built with
walls about them impossible to be demolished.

~ 18. "Thus the world was interiorly degraded-the exterior
expression of which consisted in all these exclusive institutions, castles of defence, cities of suspicion, and walls of forbidding vengeance,
on whose heights were stationed cannons of destruction.  All of
these were outward representations of the condition of the mental
world.
" While the world was in this condition, a number of manuscripts
ivere collected from the writings of different historians and of persons
interested in the social welfare of the race.  After their collection,
they were v'ted and revoted as celestial, by various councils. They
were ultimately adopted as canonical: and from that moment to the
nineteenth century, their contents have been deposited in the (Iftections but not in the judgments of men.  Inasmuch as the affections
are p)assionate, they gave forth a religious prejudicc, which it was antl
is almost impossible to subdue by the genial light of Wisdom.
"Such," continues the aged man, 1" was the condition of the religious world, that the Persians, the Hindoos, and the Mohatnrnedans,
loathed the Christians, as the Christians did them.  This established
the lines of demarcation between the interests of nations and families
of the earth; for all were opposed to each other, because Prejudice
wielded her sceptre, and the nations bowed in submission.
" The Christian religion was far the most acceptable to the enlightened, because of its pure maxims, and principles of truth and
sympathy. Soon after it was adopted, it became blended with the
social relations of those who received it; and local hostility began.
Sects, creeds, and denominations, sprang from the many interpretations of the Bible.  The latter, like a tree, has put forth branches
which extend into the mental atmosphere, and absorb the feelings,
interests, and affections, of men.  But the nations continued to be
industrious; and hence a portibn of the world became greatly advanced.-And so it was when my nation was confirmed in its present
condition.
"So things were situated, when a man proposed to discover other
portions of the earth.  At this time, navigation was greatly perfected;
and Christopher Columbus, impulsed by a disposition to explore, discovered the American continent.  Tie first settlement in the New
World became established. Immigration thereafter was immense.
The families havingegood social habits, made the land fertile in useful productions. Not long, and religious intolerance and potential
tyranny endeavored to crush the free an(i equal rights of the Ameri

cans, and to destroy their peace and prosperity by imposing unjust
claims upon their property. The inhabitants, being inspired by a
sense of justice and love of freedom, prepared to defend their rights.
A council was called, and a noble mind was intrusted with the execution of its mandates. He was called the Son of Liberty, and is
known and loved for his vigilance and his unfailing prosecution of the
work assigned him.
"The council decided that' all men were born free and equal, and
were endowed with certain inalienable rights, among which were life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'  Thenceforward they proceed0d to break the chain of despotism,.and to conquer the opponent of
their freedom.  They succeeded.  Republican government was
adopted by the voice of the people, and the race was made happy
and united. Meanwhile the various sects sprang up, and endeavored
to divide the affections of the nation.  They have in a measure succeeded: for a proof of which behold the civilized nations of the
earth!"
Reader, notice the puritan father, how he turns pale and his voice
falters in uttering this last sentence!  But listen; —he  speaks
again:
"Brethren and clergymen, your system did not cause this civilization; but it was caused by primitive invention incited by necessity,
and by subsequent cultivation of the social and intellectual powers.
It was actual industry, and not preaching; it was a knowledge of
physical necessities, and the supplying of them, that erected your
beautiful cities, accumulated your wealth, distributed your splendor,
and developed your elegance and your fertility of mental powers.
It was this that unfolded the genius of your natures, and that gave
you your worthy citizens.  But all your disunity, conflicts of inter
ests, prejudices, fear of thought, and sectarianism, are owing to that
system which you are locally promulgating, and endeavoring to extend to the heathen nations.
" Brethren, I have only one question to ask, and to this I deinand an answer: Are the causes of civilization owing to the prevalence of Christian principles?-or to the actual industry of those
who could hardly read them?  Were those wars caused by industry, or by religious intolerance and fanaticism?  If industry was and
is the cause of civilization, will the promulgation of your principles
assist this cause to advance, or arrest it?  If not, then can you say
that the heathen is sinful because he has no religion? and that you are

Father 7"
The old man has turned his face and departed.  His experience,
and knowledge of civil and religious history, are valuable to the race.
Reader, ponder well upon these revealments-and then decide
whether the clergy and their system are misrepresented.
~ 19. lMany people believe that evils in society are referable to
personal vices and individual constitutional tendencies, and thus they
impose on man a responsibility which is unjust, because he can not
assume it.  He may cherish the above belief, but he can not practise the principles of his conviction, because they are not found in
Nature, nor in Man, nor anywhere in the constitution of divine creations. Owing to the ignorance of parents concerning their own nature and its laws, the rising generation are made imperfect, because
they imbibe vices or improper inclinations from their parents hereditarily.  In this defect only are the evils of society referable to personal vices.
But it is a truth that human character is unfolded, either favorably
or unfavorably, perfectly or imperfectly, by the influence of the social
and religious conditions that surround it.  The human character is
always a representative of the soil that gave it birth, and the atmosphere in which it was developed. Inasmuch, then, as man can not
make his own being, character, or disposition, it is impossible for
him to assume the responsibility of an unactuated free agent.
Mankind are all composed of the same materials, differently coinbined, and of the same essences differently distributed; and these
different combinations constitute the varieties of mankind, and the
dissimilarities of their passions, necessities, and spiritual possessions.
Man can not think what he choouses at will; for he is compelled' to
create influences, or court them, before he can arrange and concentrate his thoughts.  In order to read, a man must have a book; in
order to converse, he must have another to hear and respond. In
like manner he is governed in all his physical and mental tendencies.
He can not love and dislike at will; for he is compelled to love that
which is lovely, and hle can not love that which is disgusting or uncongenial with the susceptibility of his affections. He can not believe or disbelieve by desire; for his mind invariably decides for or
against, according to the preponderance of evidcnce presented to his
spirit by the senses.  Therefore man can not be good when influ

ences are evil. He can not be perfect when he is imperfectly constituted.  He can not love when his affections are displeased.  He
can not think without internal or external causes being engaged in
inciting and evolving thought.  He can not believe when there is not
sufficient evidence; lie can not disbelieve when evidence preponderates.  Thus man is a child of Nature, as Nature is a child of the
Deity.  He is governed by lier principles; for they run into and
constitute his being.  Man's only free agency or free will is subject
to the promptings of Wisdom, which is his peculiar endowment.
This he is enabled to exercise over his own feelings, inclinations, and
all things below him on earth.  So far as this sanctions, he is free to
act or not to act; and this makes him a passive being, subject to influences from within and without.
Then it is proper for all mankind to know this important truth:
that man in nature is passive, because of his Wisdom, which is a counterpoise established against the Life and Love of all created things;
and that to make man moral, all influences from within and without
must correspond to the nature of his constitution, and the highest
suggestions of an enlightened Wisdom. Such is man; and such is
his relation to Nature, her laws, and the Divine Mind.
Reader, if you are elevated to a seat of honor to govern and direct
your brethren the people, your interest now consists in an exclusive
distribution of favors and privileges to those under your government.
To be in accordance with the laws of Nature, your position should
be determined by your superior constitutional qualifications.  And
your government should contemplate the interests of all living creatures, and your privileges should be distributed according to the peculiar wants of each one.  Thus you should assist all; and that by a
feeling of unrestricted benevolence, and a wise and impartial distribution of justice, liberty, and equal rights.
Reader, if you are a representative of your state or portion of the
earth, your interest consists in advocating those measures which would
benefit those who gave you the office, and in legislating for the exclusive classes and their aggrandizement.  To be in accordance with
Nature, you should be as an unblemished mirror in which would be
vividly reflected everything existing in the state or portion of the
country which you came to represent.  Then your government
would be equal, and one person would have an unbounded confidence in another.

Reader, if you are a wealthy man, your interest consists in establishing a monopoly which no other person can overcome, thereby to
accumulate more wealth. Hence you are doing injustice to the
rights of men beneath you, notwithstanding you subscribe liberally to
the support of the institutions of education, in which literature, and
art, and elegance, are taught; also to sustain asylums, and almshouses,
and prisons. The support of all these may be derived from you; and
yet you are doing injustice to the interests and rights of your subordinate brethren. To be in accordance with Nature, you should feel
no monopolizing disposition, nor should you expend so much wealth
on local institutions. Each one of these being isolated, costs at least
one third more than the same education, privileges, and benefits,
would if they were arranged according to a system of reciprocal interest and the promptings of a benevolent soul.
Reader, if you are a clergyman, your interest consists in limiting
thought, and restricting the spontaneons investigations natural to the
human mind. You are also compelled to smother your own convictions beneath the prejudices of your own congregation, and the society in which you move.  You dare not express the highest convictions of your judgment; for in that case your influence would sink,
and your occupation would no longer afford subsistence and emolument. To be in accordance with Nature, you should be teaching
that which Nature teaches, and should expound that upon which
mankind are ignorant. You should unshackle the human mind by
cultivating its Wisdom. You should inculcate no mysteries that the
human mind can not solve; for rest assured that whether such mysteries are imaginative or true, they are unnecessary to the inhabitants
of this sphere. You should teach those who need to be educated;
and teach them only that which is practicable, and tends to benefit
the whole.  Restrict no mind that is capable of reason; and if men's
thoughts are not well directed, it is your duty to cultivate their Wisdom, so that they may think properly. You should take your text
from the simple and well-written Book of Nature, whose language
all understand, and whose teachings all will receive; and thus you
will be teachers indeed.-And then your influence will purify and
elevate the spiritual elements of the whole human race.
Reader, if your profession is the law, your interest consists in the
numerous vices and disturbances occurring in society. You are not
devoted to justice so much as tofavoring him who rewards you most
liberally. To be in accordance with Nature, you should be con-,

stantly engaged in equalizing the movements of society, and teaching the world justice and love. You should be earnestly engaged
in giving justice to those who need it most, by elucidating its principles to all. And then you would be a blessing to society, and would
be honored with the title of " peace-makers," which can not now be
applied.  You should be interested in peace and universal justice;
and then the principles of Nature would fully correspond to, and
sanction, your useful labors.
~ 20. Reader, if you are a plhysician, your interest consists in
vice and sickness, and in all manner of infractions of the physical
laws, and in the prevalence of abuses in society, whereby disease is
generated and your profession is rendered eminently flourishing.
To be in accordance with Nature, you should be as the good physician, interested in the health of the whole world, earnestly studying
the interests of others, improving their minds, unfolding the mysteries
of their constitutions, and daily engaged in curing and preventing
disease.  Then you would breathe an impartial favor, and a healing
influence, to all about you; and ydu would thus be blessed while you
were blessing the existences of your brethren.
Reader, if you are a mechanic, your interest consists in all inventions that tend to reduce and depreciate the labor of man. You feel
desirous of obtaining knowledge of art sufficient to establish your
monopoly, and to insure your success over the competitions of your
neighbor.  Therefore your studies and inventions are selfish and
isolated.  To be in accordance with Nacture, you should study the
geometrical attributes of, and the mechanism manifested in, all things;
You should apply your discoveries to machinery, and to all things
profitable to the human race universally. Labor should not be isolated, but general. No strife should exist, but on the contrary there
should be a constant desire to advance the interests of the world.
Thus your own wants and the wants of others would be supplied,
while your existence would be a blessing, your labor attractive, and
your occupation happiness.
Reader, if you are a poor man, your interest consists in a hurried
and inferior tilling of the soil; for even the movements of your labor
are governed by the amount of reward which you receive. You feel
no interest in labor itself, in improvement, or in the occupations of
others: therefore your existence is displeasing and unhappy.  To
be in accordance with Naturc, you should feel an attraction to labor

as arising from its just organization and distribution.  You should
be interested in all the inventions of others, and in all things tending
to beautify and render the earth productive.
Mankind, your interests are opposed to each other: and hence all
the innumerable evils that prevail in society, and which are marring
the beauty and usefulness of the human race.  You are as a Man
whose organs are diseased, and whose requirements are opposed to
each other. You are as a body diseased internally, and whose disease is not visible to the sensuous perceptions of men. You are
striving to keep the surface healthy, and to make it appear sound and
perfect, while the disease is raging among the organs invisibly, and
these are absorbing each other's strength, and each one is striving to
transcend and govern another.
But it is impossible to continue this policy of superficial healing
much longer.  The disease and corruptions of society are bursting
forth and contaminating the body with sores of filth, and with unhealthy abominations. An effort to heal these outbreaks and running
sores would be like a physician striving to heal a bile when the blood
is diseased. Mankind as one human body must have a constitutional
cleansing and renovating. Then the body will rise to the fulness of
the stature of a perfect man, and all will be health within and peace
without.  Strive, then, to feel these truths and apply their teachings.
Do not exert yourselves to keep the surface whole, while the disease
is constitutional; but renovate your system, equalize your situations,
and thus harmonize one with another. Be as a brotherhood, and
love each other. Do this by making all things attractive, and existence a blessing. Do this by fulfilling your destiny, and thus honoring the creation of your Father which is in heaven. Do all these
things, and you will be a moral race, united in your feelings, elevated
in your affections, refined in your sentiments, and perfected in wisdom.  Do this, and you will know no distinction; for your interests
and personal existence will be blended into one harmonious Whole.
Do this, and goodness will be the result of your efforts, and righteousness the temple of your habitation.
Thus it is proved that society and the human race are a:seased.
and I now proceed to prescribe the REMEDY.

734                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
~ 21. THERE is a constitutional and mutual affection manifested
between every particle and compound in being. This is the law of
association —which is the rudimental principle of Nature established
by God, who is LOVE. This law creates, develops, and perfects,
Man —and distributes the race, together with all created things, to
portions of the earth congenial with their respective natures and qualifications.  Every form in the vegetable world is distributed by this
law of mutual affection.  The huge trees are rooted in soil and
grow in climates where the delicate flower can not subsist. A garden can not exist where the wilderness is, at least until the soil is
cultivated and rendered fertile.  Neither can the delicate forms in
the animal world exist among those that are huge, gigantic, and possessing dissimilar habits.  The fish can not live with the bird, nor
the bird with the' quadruped.  That is, one can not subsist upon that
which sustains the other: but each requires different food,,and this
distinguishes their individual necessities and habits.
So with the human world: They are distributed in various portions of the earth, and in different climates, all surrounding things in
Nature being adapted to their peculiar constitutions, and congenial
with their physical requirements.  The law of association being the
rudimental law of Nature, and flowing into and uniting all things, is
fully developed in the human form. It constitutes men differently,
gives them different passions, inclinations, and essences and properties of soul.  It creates the diversity, the multifariousness, manifested in the human world. But although it makes men unlike each
other, the variety is necessary to harmonize and unite the whole. The
diversity manifests the order of development.  It is the mode of perpetual progress, the cause of happiness, and the spring of all life and
energy, of all passion and its gratification.  Therefore the diversity
is the order of Nature, the requirement of man, and the foundation
of harmony.
Mankind inheritstheir diversified attributes from the womb of Nature, these having been there deposited and impregnated by the Love
and Wisdom of God.  These attributes constitute the affinity which
man sustains to Nature, and to her provisions to which he is entitled.
There is no passion or desire of man which Nature has not provided
means to gratify, especially when such passion or desire is governed
by TWisdom, by which also its gratification should be regulated. Man
is entitled to liberty, plenty, and happiness, by Nature.  She be

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    735
queaths these to him, and presents her larder stored with bounteous
provisions, and invites man to receive, enjoy, and cultivate them, and
be what she intended he should.
This inseparable relation between man and Nature and the Principles of God, is established by the law of association. There is no
possible way to annul this reciprocal relation, or to escape from the
obligation to bow in obedience to the laws which govern it. This
law of Nature is divine, because it is the Love and Life of the Deity.
It distributes impartial blessings to all, and for every action it dispenses an adequate reward or punishment. There can be no denial
of the absoluteness of the connexion, and there is no escaping the
effects accomplished by the workings of these principles.
Man is, then, a child of Nature, caressed, and guided into all wisdom, by her unchangeable possessions. Man is well formed, well
constructed, and well distributed, on the bosom of Nature; and he,
as a dutiful child, should acknowledge the relation and submit to her
wise commands and dispensations.
As the law of association thus unites Nature and man, and establishes diverse and multipotent characteristics in the race, it is upon
this indestructible basis that rests the law of reciprocal justice and
consequent morality and happiness. Every being, then, is entitled
by Nature to liberty and happiness; and if every one does not receive
these, injustice is done in some portion of the human world. If the
desires of a single being are not gratified, then there is an unjust and
isolated absorption in some parts of the great Body, which is an injury both to the absorber and to those subject to the absorption.
All men have not the same desires, and do not need tile same
gratification. Each one has peculiar wants, and the wants of each
one differ in their degrees of development. Hence it follows that
happiness should be dispensed by bestowing blessings in proportion
to the capabilities of men to appreciate and enjoy them.  Those who
have superfluous gratifications are as miserable as those whose wants
are not adequately supplied.  In the one instance, desires become morbid, unhealthy, and corrupting,; while in the other, they are impetuous
and constantly generating vice, disease, and unhappiness.  It is therefore an injury for any one to have more than he can well employ,
appreciate, or make useful; while on the other hand, it is unjust to
deprive any one of that which is necessary to his existence, or of any
blessing to which he is entitled by Nature.
To prevent absorption in any part of the great human Body, there

fore, the Wisdom of men must recognise the divine law of Association. This law must be applied by making all situations and all
degrees of human industry correspond to its uniform requirements.
Here, then, is the first item in the remedy for the disease of the
social world.
Mankind, remember you must become acquainted with your nature, your Creator, and the laws which inseparably unite and harmonize all created things. You must become enlightened, and feel the
force of this divine truth; and in doing this you will remove a part
of the disease which now corrupts your mental constitution.
The law of Association, then, establishes harmony, and imperatively forbids injustice to anything which it comprehends within its
dominion; and this is only limited by the expanse of inconceivable
space.
Another truth, then, is necessarily evolved, and must be acknowledged; and that is, that every man is not only entitled to liberty,
plenty, justice, and happiness, but he has an important office to fulfil,
an end to accomplish, and a destiny to fulfil. Hence each man must
have a distinct position in the great structure of human society; and
that position must be determined by his constitutional qualifications,
and his ability to discharge the obligations it imposes. He must
gravitate to his own peculiar centre, as this is determined by the law
of association: that is, to whatever soil, climate, occupation, and situation, may be most congenial with his natural inclinations as modified
and governed by Wisdom.
Men now occupy situations which they are not capable of filling;
and therefore everything they do is injurious to some, beneficial to
others, and disgusting to themselves.  Being compelled to engage
in that which they are not qualified to perform, creates discontent in
the mind, and does injustice to all dependent on their labors. But
every one is entitled to a position determined by the quality and
abilities of his constitution.
~ 22. Each man is but an organ of the great human Body.  In
the present condition of things, one organ is opposed to, and absorbs
the strength and happiness of, another.  This generates every species of evil, pain, wretchedness, and disorganization.  But it is proper
that each individual, as an organ of the body, should occupy a position agreeable with the demands of his own nature and the nature of
others; and thus distributive and impartial justice would be gener

ated, which would remove the disease, renovate and perfect the
body, and promote unity and happiness.
Suppose a man to have a disease which affects each organ by
obstruction, absorption, and a disturbance of the equilibrium in
their forces and essences: would it not be proper to remove the obstruction, destroy absorption, and equalize the forces and essences,
so that they might create health? Then if this is the correct process,
is it not equally correct to remove all absorption, obstruction, and
want of equilibrium in society-so that every man, like an organ of
the body, may perform his appropriate functions, and not only be
happy himself, but generate happiness for others?
One effect of the law of association is known as harmony; and
harmony is the soul and element of music.  Music is a representation of divine Order; and Order is the Wisdom of the Deity.  To
establish harmony, therefore, in society, every man must be well instructed and properly situated, so that his movements may accord
with the movements of the whole; and thus the movements of the
human race will be in concert.
Suppose a musical instrument well constructed, and capable of
giving forth perfect and beautiful melody.  Suppose also that the
notes it is capable of sounding all accompany it, but are confused.
Think you that harmony can proceed from that instrument?  Notwithstanding the notes are all there, if they are not well placed, well
timed, or properly concerted, the consequence will be that the most
disgusting and frightful discord will proceed from the instrument.  So
with the human race: the structure is pefect; the notes are all existing; but they are misplaced: and vice, antagonism, and immorality.
are the consequences.
The instrument'of society can not be tuned except by an enlightened Wisdom.  Wisdom  may arrange society, and place every man
in a position congenial with his own nature and the universal requirements of the race.  After mankind are so situated, discord can not
arise, but most happy harmony, morality, virtue, and riglhteousness,
will prevail.
Man has no desires that can not be gratified.  lie has no peculi —
arities but what some position would render agreeable and proper.And these peculiarities must be considered as a musician would con —

arrange them  in concert, so that melody may be fully developed.
There is not, nor will there ever be, one being, too many.  But it}?

order to make man fulfil his destiny, place him in a situation to do it.
Make industry attractive; make every dispensation just, and determine every position by specific qualifications. Advance the lower
strata of society by pervading them with Wisdom and pure influences. Then every man will perform the use for which he was
destined, and all contention that now prevails will be lost in the harmony of the whole.
Mankind must be so distributed, and every person niust be so situated, as that the position of each may correspond to, and harmonize
with, divine Law, such as is established by God in Nature and in
Man unchangeably. Every individual must gravitate to the position
suggested by his nature and its necessities, and also by the requirements of others, above and below him, in the Brotherhood. There
should be no restriction to individual movements, especially when
all movements are determined by the wisdom and righteousness of
the supreme governor and director of human society. Every person should be as harmoniously situated as the notes in a well-arranged
piece of music; and then all feeling, inclination, judgment, industry,
progress, and intellectual attainment, would completely correspond
to the law of uniform development and the combined interests of
the whole.
No person upon the earth should exist inferiorly situated, because
such is not in accordance with the nature and order of divine creations. No faculties should be crushed for the want of mental liberty;
no powers of a mechanical, mathematical, or philosophical tendency,
should be obstructed; for Nature prescribes liberty and unrestriction
of thought. Hence man should be so situated as that all his spiritual qualities and faculties may be uncontrolled, and their unfoldings
unbounded. That these things may be so, men should occupy those
positions only which they are capable of filling, and in which they:
are happy and at home. But at present, some are teachers who are
not so capable of teaching as many of their pupils. Some are occupying important offices by a voice of the people, and yet are not so
capable of governing as those who are governed are to control
themselves.
And one truth prominent among all nations and in all ages of the
world is, that the most useful, pure, benevolent, and intelligent men,
are those who, receiving a perfect constitution by birth, and being
naturally situated, have unfolded a teeming intellect, such as never
proceeds from any institution or any mode of obtaining superficial

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    739
education.  Hence it is clear that all those who are good and perfect, and have the most truth, are the unsophisticated offspring of
Nature. Such minds possess all the qualifications of mechanics, phi;
losophers, and philanthropists, and love truth and wisdom for their
own sakes only, and not to acquire the character of being learned,
and thus be advanced to honor and emolument. It is proper, then,
that all should be perfectly arranged and well situated, so that all the
movements of men, whether industrial or mental, may accord with
their own nature and the interests of the whole society.
Men must become acquainted with the law of association and its
distributions, before they can concert an harmonious brotherhood on
earth. And after men are well situated, so that the whole will correspond to a system of undisturbed harmony, then will be developed
the law of Order. This Order will unite them, and also represent
the same displayed in the structure of the Universe. And thus the
lowest and most imperfect will occupy the lowest point in society;
and a graduated development will characterize the ascending groups,
until they rise to the highest point of human perfection.  And then
he who is the most perfect in his physical and spiritual constitution,
will occupy the highest position in society, as governor, and will
pervade the whole by Wisdom, add direct them righteously according to divine harmony and universal order.
~ 23. Then there will be an order in human society, in which every group may represent a planet. And the groups may be so arranged as that their interests will revolve around the central object
of their own industry-and the Temple of Knowledge.  Let the Sun
of the race be the centre of all human wisdom, whose enlivening influence may generate industry, abundance, and happiness.  Let each
group, society, or state, be a planet; and let the whole give to and
receive from the central Sun congenial reciprocations, so that there
may not exist any inertia, restriction, poverty, or unhappiness.
Moreover, let each group, as a planet, revolve within or around the
orbits of others, according to their relation to the Sun of Knowledge
and Centre of pervading happiness.
Each group will occupy such a position in relation to the Centre
or Sun of society as is determined by its degree of progress, and its
department of industry, so that its movements may be profitable and
well defined. And there will be a uniform movement of all the

740                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
groups, both within themselves and in their revolutions around their
central governor or Sun of attraction.
And the various departments of society will represent the Solar
System also in their mutual exchangings of purified and perfected
particles. In other words, persons in the first society who advance
and become capable of associating with the second, must be permitted to ascend and occupy the positions in the scale of progressive
development for which they have become qualified.  And let this
mutual exchange be continued through all the groups, even up to
the central power.  And he who arrives there first by natural qualification, will succeed to the throne of government. And so there will
be a constant supply of particles (or persons), both at the seat of
government and at the extremities of society.
Individual advancement, to be pure, must be unceasing and perpetual. A person in the lowest society will gyrate through all the
positions he is there capable of occupying, and ascend in like manner
through all the societies to the Sun or seat of Wisdom.  A perpetual
reciprocation will be an inevitable consequence of the arrangement
of society according to the divine law of association.  Therefore an
incessant progression will characterize human society and its component parts.
This mutual exchange of particles, or individuals, will result naturally from the order of refinement in each group or society; for their
degree, or nearness to the centre, must be determined by their innate
capabilities, and their absolute relation to the centre of Wisdom. So
every individual will feel an inclination toward the centre of attraction; and all his efforts will be concentrated to gain the lofty seat.
Also his interest will consist in the purity of his progress; for deception and impure enlightenment would only render a person more
gross, and cause Lim to remain in a lower society longer than he
otherwise would. Besides this, persons will mutually assist each
other, inasmuch as a reciprocal assistance, without any isolated absorption, will materially accelerate the purification of all, and accomplish it more in accordance with natural law.
Each group will of itself constitute a little world, or a congregation
of affectionate and inseparable individuals, laboring for each other's
welfare.  They will accumulate wealth for each other's enjoyment,
and exchange favors one with another, for the purpose of making
their group exceed as much as possible the lower, and approach in
refinement the higher, and thus a lower and higher interest'will be

established.  Each group. should be like a planet in every particular; for each planet is an accumulation of mutually-agreeable particles, all assisting to effect a universal refinement.  And thus associated, they revolve with unanimity around the Sun or Centre of their
existence; and so should each group in the Solar System of mankind
on earth. Each group, society, or state, as a planet, should be constituted of mutually-assisting particles (or persons), congenial with
each other and with the sun or centre around which all societies
should revolve in their movements and efforts to advance and become
perfect.
This, then, should be the order of society.  Then mankind would
represent the harmony of the Solar System, in which no disturbance
is discoverable, because the great central Sun is both the parent and
governor, whose pervading influence sustains an indestructible equilibrium.
After having established this Order, a Form will be developed.
This will be an expression of human wisdom, and will indicate the
beauty of developed social happiness.  This form will be as a human
body in its arrangements and interior movements, but will correspond
externally to the structure of the Universe.  By Form is meant the
mode of preserving and perpetuating Order, serving as a chart upon
which will be impressed the situation of each person in society, and the
relation of each to the central power. This Form will not only be the
mode of preserving external Order, but of perfecting interior industry
and individual character.  It will be the Body of Mankind-a perfect representation of interior order, harmony, and association.  It
will be the means by which all mankind can associate with the beauties of Nature and the laws of God, even as a man associates with
external things through the senses of the organization.  And the human race will have a Form that will be a perfect representative of
interior purity, harmony, and spiritual loveliness-that will be a
perfect likeness of its interior, even as the human body is an irnmage
of the soul.
Mankind always had and always will have a Body, and that will
represent the interior; and therefore a knowledge of the Soul of society may be had by carefully viewing its Form. —And at present this
is very imperfect and very much disconcerted.
This, then, should be the plan of reorganizing society and the
human world: First, develop Light, or the law of association. Unfold its teachings and apply them  to the race.  By thls means, Ljfe

will be established, which is industry, harmony, and happiness. Then
perfect Love will reign; for Light and Life are Love.-And association and harmony are the legitimate effects of Love, and Love
is God.
After having developed these, an Order will be displayed in the
structure of the race.  This order will be the standard and law of
human industry and mental qualification. It will confirm a unity of
Interest, and an unchanging reciprocation of feeling, affection, and
mental associations, fiorn the lowest to the highest degree of human
advancement.
From this the human world will receive a Form-which will be
the fulness of the stature of a perfect Man. And this Form will be
the great exterior representative of interior love and industry, and
also the mode by and through which the great Soul of Mankind will
commune with the excellences of higher Spheres. Then Order and
Form will be established, which are representatives of Wisdomsuch as will emanate from the centre of social government, and
spread distributive justice over the earth.
Then society will be in this condition: Perfect Light and Life,
which are association and harmony, the whole of which will constitute Love perfectly developed: —and Order and Form, which are
movement and mode, and which will constitute Wisdom, perfectly
developed. Thus the human race will display Light and Life,
wvhich are Love, and Order and Form, which are Wisdom.  Thus
will be established universal happiness-because the whole rmce will
represent the harmony of all created things, and typify the express
majesty of the Divine Creator.

and particular to the uniform kingdoms and creations of Nature.
The lower stratum in the human world will, when properly arranged,
take the lowest point, and correspond to the primary stratification of
the earth. And the strata or groupsof society may be uniformly
situated one above another, as relative innate purity and capability
may determine, and as is represented in the geological formations of
this terrestrial sphere.-And the highest group may, in all its intelIecaal and brilliant excellences, correspond to the bosom of Nature,
or the last stratum of the earth.

But human society may be organized on a more definite plan even
than this. The first or incapable group of society may be so constructed as to represent the mineral world.  That is, it may have
three divisions: the first being the lowest, the second being the mediatbrial, and the third being the highest-and the whole composing
a perfect structure, and meanwhile naturally immerging into the society or group next above. Every particle in the mineral kingdom
is incessantly engaged in activity, whereby the good of each is mutually established, and a reciprocal interest is caused to pervade the,vhole.  So it may be with the first group or lower stratum of society.
One may assist to sustain and develop another, which in return will
act upon others; and thus will be established an interior industry so
perfectly organized that no person will be compelled to labor excessively, to sustain unjust responsibilities, or be in any way deprived
of his physical and mental requirements.
The second group may be made to correspond in its structure to
the vegetable kingdom: and this can be accomplished by understanding
the mutual relations existing between all plants as individuals, and
how they are inseparably engaged in promoting a general good, ob
serving a righteous reciprocation among themselves.  Society, then,
in its second department, would be a representative of the vegetable
kingdom.
The ascending group may correspond to, and typify in every department, the animal world and its harmony.  So may the highest
or central group correspond to Mankind, in their relation to Nature
and the various kingdoms. And as man is lord over of all subordinate creations; as lie possesses the wisdom of love, and is a crown
of material perfection, it is suggested that the central group of human
society should manifest all the intelligence and perfection of the
whole race concentrated.  It may be the throne of human government, and the unfailing source of justice, benevolence, and liberty.
This may be the centre of attraction to which all should be inclined,
and by which all will be assisted to attain any degree of eminence
possible for Wisdom to desire.
Society may be divided and subsided into as many groups or families as may be suggested by Wisdom  and existing circumstances;
and each individual group may correspond to the infinite variety contained in each kingdom  in Nature.  That is, the lower stratum of
society may comprehend as many towns, counties, or states, as may
be determined by general desire, and by a just estimate of human

744                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
character and its qualifications; and these again may be subdivided
into a variety of families or associations. And then they will correspond precisely to the specific compoutds that are contained in the
mineral kingdom. There is an infinite variety in this kingdom, and
all have distinctive existences.  So society may be constructed: and
harmony will be the inevitable consequence, inasmuch as harmony is
invariably manifested in the mineral kingdom, as a result of its
structure.
So also the second stratum may comprehend as many portions of
towns, counties, or states, as will harmonize with the situation of the
lower; and this may represent the vegetable kingdom.  Yet it should
only be distinguished from the lower and higher by a different structure, though one calculated to perpetuate individual progression.
So with the third stratum; and so also with the fourth, which may
be the centre of the human family, either on one continent or on
both, and situated where all facilities exist, or can be made to exist,
by which its influence may descend through all the lower strata and
contribute to their health, happiness, and advancement.  From this
centre, a just administration must and will proceed; for no one can
be the governor, emperor, or lord, of the human race, unless he has
attained the highest possible degree of human wisdom.  Such a one
will be calculated to rule and govern all the departments of human
industry, direct and perfect the establishment of all conveniences,
explore and investigate all phenomena, and distribute peace, justice,
and harmony, to all without distinction.
Society may be thus organized, inasmuch as the structure and laws
of Nature suggest the plan.  Moreover, the latter constitute a foundation upon which the superstructure may be erected indestructibly.
And all its parts may be united by the same laws, actuated by the
same general interests, and be preserved in the same undisturbed
harmony.
Such is the anatomy of society presented for human contemplation
and analysis.  It is merely a general suggestion; and although true,
it may be deemed imlpracticable by many good and intelligent minds.
Such must analyze the features of this suggestion; and if it is not found
to be true, and more suggestive than it would at~first appear to be, it
should lead to a better structure; and then its impulse will be pure,
useful, and remedial of the present disorganized state of all human
society.

Such is the cure for the corroding disease dwelling in the vitals of
the human race, and existing in every society, state, nation, and em.
pire, upon the earth. The disease has been revealed unexaggerated;
its remedy is simple and will be effectual, if properly applied.
Having presented society in its disorganized condition, and the
principles to organize it, it is proper to explain how these principles
may soon be comprehended, and their teachings applied-and how
mnen may proceed, without much destruction of interests or violence
to local prejudices, to accomplish the reorganization. This can be
done without changing the component parts of present society, and
also without dislocating men from their present positions, or destroying their situations, except in a qualified degree, to which they will
cheerfully accede, and thus effect the general millennium. Remember that all this harmony may be established without creating any serious conflict or disturbance in the present organization of social
affairs.  But in order to accomplish this, a living energy must inspire every philanthropist and every enlightened teacher, and they
must be unceasing for a little time in preaching to the inhabitants of
the earth, " Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."  For
all must repent, or, in other words, receive the conviction that distributive justice must pervade the social world before God's kingdom
can come, and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven-or
throughout all the higher spheres of celestial happiness.  Keeping
this in memory, I will now proceed to direct how the great remedy
may be obtained, how the disease may be arrested and the system
renovated, and how the divine kingdom may be established, and the
new heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness may be
understood, acknowledged, applied, and established, throughout the
human race.
x 25. To SUCCEED, the primary movements to elevate social relations, and to establish individual industry, may be commenced on
this wise: Six agriculturists, inspired with the principles of charity
and the spirit of improvement, and having a desire to associate,
lnay form themselves into an association or corporation, with combined interests and desires for prosperity.  They must fully under

746                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
stand each other, both as to their physical and mental qualifications,
and must know how near they can approach a unity of interests, and
how much each can contribute to the interests of the association.
They may enter into an agreement, such as will constitute them
a corporation.  This agreement must be based upon a plain diagramr
representing their individual possessions, interests, intentions, and
proposed mode of condensing and organizing labor. This instrument of agreement must be as a map, representing their farms, with
their value, their situations, their qualities of soil as to fertility or bar
renness, their various locations, and the positions which they respectively occupy in relation to the nearest village, to the rivers or
ports of commerce, and the existing facilities of effecting an access
to the most populous and opulent cities.  Moreover, it must represent every kind of soil, with its precise- condition, as productive of
vegetables, oats, rye, wheat, barley, corn, and also state the amount
and condition of meadow and wood lands. A clear and lucid investigation, calculation, and statement, must be made in reference to
the amount of labor necessary to bestow upon each division of one
or all of the farms in order to render it fertile, productive, accessible,
and remunerative.
Each individual must make a clear and truthful statement of the
embarrassments, obligations, and expenses, to which he is at present
subject; and also of the probable amnount of money required to advance the condition of his farm to a high state of cultivation.
This agreement must be the spontaneous expression of their benevolent and united minds, impregnated with the desire and intention
to remedy their own estrangement in industrial pursuits, and to correspondingly benefit community.
Six men, possessing farms in proper relations to each other, would
be the least possible number who could concentrate and produce
power among themselves, such as would be sensibly felt by all surrounding them.  To this number any additional number may be
joined, if the land occupied by them is in close connexion, and unbroken by any opposing landholder or agriculturist.
After deciding on the structure of their corporation, one of the
members, who is most competent, should be chosen to officiate as
governor, or president, and recording secretary. He should be
qualified to suggest improvements, and to decide upon the most
proper mode of organizing and distributing labor advantageously.
This person should be the centre around which the rest should re

volve or act in unity, and to whom they will look for justice in his
dispensations and propriety in his suggestions and plans of labor'and
improvement. This one will manage the affairs of the association;
and be as a standard to the corporation.
After having spiritually associated, devised their plan of agreement, and having all arrangements in order, agreeable to the situation
and interests of each one, it is proper to institute the most searching
investigations as to what may beautify their land, and restore fertility
to the barren portions-and as to the most feasible plans to arrange
and condense their labor for the accomplishment of this end.  They
must understand the science of organic chemistry in all of its ramifications, so that they may restore to weak soil its required equilibrium
of organic matter, and thus fertilize and render it productive.  They
must also understand and apply in the tilling of their land the teachings of modern geology and magnetism. They must learn never to
exhaust the soil of its requisite chemical properties, which is now
frequently done by uninformed farmers.  Soil can only retain its
thriftiness and capacity of vegetable production by having restored
to its bosom as much elementary matter as is taken from it. To
sustain the fertility of the soil, then, it is necessary to understand the
principles of geology and chemistry; the qualities of marine and alluvial deposites; the action of decomposed vegetable and animal compounds; the constitution of the earth and atmosphere, and the mutual relation which exists between them, and their co-operation in
rendering fertile a parsimonious soil.  Understanding these important principles, and perceiving their practicability, they will be enabled to devise the most agreeable means of applying them, so as to
make them profitable in promoting their individual wealth and general advancement.
Then they must inquire into the various modes and plans of organizing and combining labor; how much labor it is proper to bestow upon any given object; at what time it should be bestowed, and
how many can labor profitably to accelerate its accomplishment.
Knowing these things, and adopting the proper plans of proceeding,
they should call to their assistance as many laborers as can properly
and profitably be employed.
They should not work orer three quarters of the period of sunlight; and the employment of each one must be of such a character as will agree with his constitutional abilities and his desire to
be engaged.

748                A VOICE TO MANKIND.
Thus organized, the distribution of labor for each week may be
determined at the close of the previous one; and in this way each
person will understand the portion assigned him, the position he is
to occupy, and the amount of labor he is to accomplish. The laborers should be distributed in groups of numbers and strength sufficient
to perform within the week the amount to them allotted.
Each member of the association must keep a strict account of his
personal and general expenses, of the amount of labor accomplished
in each six days on his farm, and of the number of men by whom it
was accomplished. Thus each one, at the end of the week, should
bring to the governor a truthful register of labor received from the
groups of the association.
The quarter of time not devoted to the field may be set apart for
individual diversion, instruction, study, and contemplation.  Let it
be exclusively devoted to all things pertaining to mental and moral
improvement.-And thus he who labors will labor with a pleasure
and profit to his physical being, and will change manual labor for
mental advancement in every department of science, art, agriculture,
and spiritual truth.
In this manner can labor be condensed, made attractive, profitable,
and elevating. And this is the rudimental step toward establishing
among the tillers of the land a reciprocal movement, and a privilege
of assisting themselves and community to a more congenial and useful existence.  This may be called an "Agricultural Association."
They will discover that they have the advantage over all individuals
of like occupation in society, and that they will be enabled to supply
the requirements of a populous village with more ease and profitableness than any dealer, merchant, or speculator.
~ 26. The Firm, in some thriving and populous village, town, or
city, should erect a large and capacious Storehouse, which should be
wisely constructed and adapted to the reception of their various productions. It should be situated conveniently, and made in every
possible manner suitable to receive their abundant productions, which
may be distributed according to the wants and requirements of the
people. In this storehouse they must deposite in order the various
creations of their industry, which should be valued at the same price
which the community are compelled to pay for the same articles to
merchants and grocers under the present system  of trade.  This
storehouse and its abundant possessions, belonging to the Agricul

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    749
turist Firm, would be a living illustration of the advantages of organized and rewarded labor, and a blessing to community.
This establishment may be conducted by any well-qualified person
chosen by the association, and his assistants may be of his own
choosing; and they all should belong to the association, and to a
greater or less extent have an interest in its stock and wealth, so that
each individual may have an interest centred in the prosperity of the
Firm, both in respect to the farms and the establishment.  Thus a
unity of action would exist as a spontaneous result of the situation
of each individual; and this would remove all deception, and develop
justice and honesty in each being.
Each farmer should receive credit in proportion to the amount of
stock by him deposited, and should be rewarded in proportion to its
increasing revenue.  A value must be placed upon each article of
produce by the united voice of the whole Firm. This should be a
standard by which each parcel should be valued as it enters the establisllment; and credit should be given the depositor accordingly.
The amount of stores in the establishment will be governed by the
productions of the farms, and the reward of each laborer will hold a
relation to the amount of produce in, and the benefits derived from,
the establishment.  Thus there will be a reciprocal exchange of interests, which will secure the permanency of the association, and render inexhaustible the capital of the Agriculturist Firm.
The contents of the storehouse may be sold to the community as
they demand, at a price determined by the benevolence of the Firm,
- who under such circumstances can sell at least fifteen per cent.
cheaper than the same articles can be sold by individual tradesmen
in villages and cities. And even then the productions will yield the
producers at least twenty-five per cent. profit.  And according as the
distribution of labor is advantageous can this ratio be increased, even
to double.
There will be a mutual deposition of capital, and a corresponding
interest, which will constitute the whole association an established
monopoly, and which will compel a change in the present order of
industry, trade, and commerce. The influence of such an association, properly situated, would extend to adjoining townships and
counties, and would be sensibly felt in various portions of the state.
This would attract one farmer after another into the association, to
arrest the depreciation of his land, and the decrease of the inflow of
wealth from its productions. No individual farmer could compete





## p. 750 (#786) ############################################


750                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
with the association, and consequently its influence would continually widen by taking more into its constitution.  And an influence,
corresponding to that exerted on all members of the association,
would be exerted on the inhabitants of the adjoining towns and counties; so that by a gradual yet permanent expansion, this system  of
agricultural labor would ultimately comprehend a whole state.  Then
other states could not resist its tranquillizing influence, and would
adopt a similar mole of combining wealth with industry, and interest
with energy and knowledge.
At first it would be best for associations of not less than six to
form in various parts of towns, counties, or states, where all necessary facilities are existing, and all circumstances are such as to justify
the enterprise.  These small associations being once established,
would enlarge until the interest of one would run into and become
the interest of another; and ultimately a whole state would be combined as one Firm, governed by the same principles of justice and
industry, and actuated by the same interests to all physical and intellectual improvement.
The first good object of such an association will be to combine interests, wealth, power, sympathy, and benevolence, and to bring men
in closer relations as to their social and intellectual natures.  Their
interests will consist, not in the accumulation of needless wealth, but
in happiness-which each person will enjoy, from being so situated
as to render others happy.  Not for the purpose of speculating upon
community will the association labor, but to ameliorate the condition
of the mechanic and the various professions, by supplying their wants
abundantly, and at a price which falls within their resources.
The second object will be to combine labor so judiciously that
one man, by working no more than under the present system, may
produce twice the amount of labor, and create more food for general
consumption.  And thus it will be proved that organized industry is
the only proper and effectual means of supplying the requirements
of consumers, and making labor agreeable, healthful, instructive,
and remunerative.
Another object will be to increase the demand for laborers, and
advance tile reward of labor-thereby giving employment to those
who are now idle, and providing a proper subsistence for those foreign immigrants who are becoming citizens of the United States, and
are being distributed in various portions of each state, destitute of
property, health, and food.  By increasing the demand for labor,





## p. 751 (#787) ############################################


A VOICE TO MANKIND.                      751
and augmenting its reward, industry will become attractive to those
who are compelled to labor for a subsistence. And by having this
labor well distributed, and applied wisely and scientifically, it will
mnake the soil productive, so that under any atmospheric vicissitudes
it will yield enough to supply the wants of the whole association, the
laborers included, and supply the storehouse with sufficient to redeem
all expenses, and dispense an adequate and agreeable reward to each
member.
Another valuable object will be attained'; and that is, that six farms
of ordinary size, conveniently situated in reference to the ports of
commerce or towns and cities, would be made to produce as much
as ten farms of equal size and quality of soil under the present system
of cultivation. Three fourths more may be derived from one farm
than is under the existing crude system of labor and agricultural science. An application of the principles and teachings of chemistry
-in the cultivation of the soil, would restore to it the most surprising
thriftiness and richness of production.  It could in a little time be
made to produce sufficient to preserve its equilibrium of moisture
and fertility, and also to supply the increasing wants of the associatiofi and the community.
~ 27. If six farms, then, can be made to yield as much as ten do
under the present system of agriculture, is it not reasonable to suppose that the various vicissitudes of the seasons can not destroy more
than the amount ordinarily produced by four farms?  And then the
productions of six would yet be preserved, which would afford an
ample reward to the laborer and the capitalist. No season, however
unfavorable, ever destroys more than one half of the ordinary productions of the soil. And even what would remain in such a one
would, in association, more than supply all wants, and leave untouched all individual investments.
Men who engage in this enterprise must not feel that the accumulation of money is their object, but the greatest amount of happiness. Therefore the six agriculturists must be men having a high
sense of justice, benevolence, and sympathy, not only for each other,
but as respects the social condition of the community at large. They
must feel that money is not valuable as productive of happiness; that
it is no security against the invasion of disease, poverty, or destitution; that it is no benefit to their children, to community, or to the
world. They must feel that money is now but a subject of individual

and general infatuation-and that it is a most useless substance,
and should not attract the attention of the noble mind, nor command
the obedience of that dignified soul who feels that he lives for wisdom and happiness, and not for slavish degradation.  With these
feelings, they will come together and join their individual possessions, for the purpose of increasing power, charity, benevolence, and
happiness. They must not join for the purpose of increasing individual wealth, or speculating on the laborer or the community; but
for the purpose of increasing the demand for, and the reward of,
labor, and to beautify the soil by applying scientific principles, and
thus perfecting its fruitful qualities.
These men must well understand the depths of their own judgments,
and of their feelings of benevolence and desires for unity. —And if
each can arrive at the conclusion that they are living here to live
again, and that their true desires and destinies are to procure hIappiness, then they may form an association impervious to all selfish and
aristocratic innovations. They must not join their farms for the purpose of receiving as much interest as under their present mode of
cultivation, but for the purpose of feeling as one fjmily, united in their
interests and enterprise, and one in their intentions to benefit the
laboring classes, themselves, and the community at large.
In justice, there.is no right to claim a stipulated interest for the
appropriation of any portion of land, inasmuch as the soil is a bestowment and dispensation of Nature, unmerited by the existence
ingenuity, or industry, of any human being.  In truth, labor is the
use and destiny of man on earth, especially when that labor is attractive, well distributed, and well compensated.  Then the association
must exist on this wise:The existence, person, or body, of every laborer, must be considered as the only real and natural investment in the capital of the
Firm. The industry of each individual is the personal bestowment
of capital, for which each is entitled to every blessing and real requirement of life, and for the bestowment of which the association as
a body is accountable. In this way, each individual would feel an
interest in the amount of labor accomplished, and its results, and
therefore an interest in the action of the whole.  Labor alone must
be remunerated; capital should be considered as an auxiliary — as
a dispensation of Nature-and the foundation upon which the proposed superstructure can rest and be successfully established.
The object of having a standard price to each article, and a con

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    753
ventional rule as regulating the creation, deposition, and distribution,
of the productions, is to facilitate the preservation of memoranda, and
to conform as much as possible to mercantile arrangements that are
existing; and also that there may be a definite value affixed to each
article, to labor, and to the goods or property which each member
appropriates to himself from the productions of the whole.  These
rules of procedure would be proper, in order to conform in a measure to present usages and cherished prejudices, and to a distaste for
a too sudden transition from the present system to such an association
of labor and interest.
Labor must have a reward prescribed in the rules of the compact;
and that must be in proportion to the amount and kind of work performed, and the circumstances under which each one labors: each
having a position assigned him in the field, which he is qualified to
sustain. And this rule Inust apply to all, from the one who digs the
trench, to the governor of the association; and the reward in all cases
must be graduated according to the labor accomplished by the individual, and must be determined by the wisdom of the enlightened
members and the sanction of the governor.
Remember that each one must be situated advantageously in the
field and in every other department of the Agriculturist Association.
Let Wisdom govern the distribution and compeisation of labor, and
not desire or impulse.  Things being situated in this wise, labor could
be rewarded justly and proportionally; and this by a conventional
sum established by the wisdom, justice, and benevolence, of the first
associates.  And these must be careful not to have more interest in
self-emolument than in the cheerfulness and happiness of the laborer..
Understand, then, that each man is to labor three fourths of a day,
for which he is to be credited, and is to have as much as is necessary
for his comfort, for which he shall be charged.  At the end of each:
season, a general statement of affairs must be made and presented to.
each member, stating the amount of labor performed, its reward,. the
amount of produce received, and the balance of its proceeds afterexpenses are defrayed.  And after each laborer is duly rewarded,,
the unexhausted wealth must be justly distributed to each primary
depositor of property, as the just interest on his investment.
Labor is the first and only thing absolutely demanding reward.,
An interest must be paid upon its outlay; and after this the capitalistsmay receive the remaining sum, more or less, as interest on their
primary deposition of property.  The land can. not be destroyed -

will not lose its value-will never fail to be a substantial guaranty
against poverty or destitution.  The human body-the laborer —is
the only real capital demanding an interest from the wealth, strength,
and opulence, of the association.  And it is the man and his efforts
that must be appreciated, and not the unmerited soil, to which no
man by nature has a just and exclusive claim.
~ 28. And in orde'r to conform to the present state of education,
and to existing social movements, it is proper to commence a new
heaven and a new earth with as much caution, gentleness, and judgment, as can be brought to bear, in reference to the present and a
better system of social and intellectual affairs.  And hence the rnecessity of having good and benevolent men to give the first impetus,
and to consequently compel the remaining portions of the community
to adopt a new system of social organization. A sacrifice must be:made for the purpose of attaining a glorious reward, and a more desirable state of things.
The generality of minds will oppose this benevolent system, and
believe it to be impracticable; but this will not arrest the efforts of
six well-associated agriculturists, and the influence which they will
exert over all the portions of each town, county, state, kingdom, and
continent.
These are the incipient movements necessary to institute or create
from the old a new world in respect to social interests and happiness.
These first movements, after having been in operation for a few seasons, will resolve themselves into systems already conceived and
partly established.  New suggestions will be made, leading to improvements in every department of agriculture, science, social reform,
and happiness. After being thus organized, each person will con-,ceive how-he can improve and advance his individual interests, and
also the objects of universal benevolence.  Therefore the community
will glide imperceptibly from this crude system of association to the
highest point of physical, social, and intellectual cultivation; and ul-.
timately they will arrive at that eminence of perfection which will
establish peace on earth, love to the neighbor, and good-will to.all men.
On this rudimental principle may the association be conceived
and established. And it will resolve itself from one system into
another, and incessant progress will exemplify the constitutional tendency of human nature, until the earth will yield abundantly; until

the farms appear like gardens; until industry is appreciated as a blessing; and every member, participating in the goodness thereof, will
fulfil the destiny of his creation.  And all being associated in interests and wisdom, will exercise distributive justice, and be HAPPY!
Love, unity, peace, power, wisdom, wealth, and happiness, will be
the inherent attributes of the constitution thus formed.  And these
attributes will spring up and flow forth among the various and higher
branches of art, science, and mechanism.  Once establish such an
association, and the demand for the invention, perfection, and manufacturing, of agricultural implements, will be increased.  This will
arouse the genius of every inventive mind, as men will see the need
of instruments to till, beautify, and make fruitful, the soil.  The influence of this will extend to all mechanics and their various objects
ofpursuit.  Consequently a corresponding association must be formed
among them, so that they may supply the demands of the farmer, and
so that the two associations may freely exchange productions and
wealth with each other.
An association of MECHANICS for the purpose of perfecting and
utilizing machinery may be composed of from fifteen to thirty memrnbers. An article of agreement must join them in unity, and specify
all their various investments, their proposed distribution of labor, the
kind needed, the qualifications of the members to perform the various
and specific branches of mechanical labor, the number of hours to
work in one day (which should be with them  not more than two
thirds of sunlight), the advantages which they will have in respect to
commerce, and the proposed location of their association, which
should be in a convenient and accessible place.  These things must
be all clearly stated upon their articles of agreement.  They must
have their principles of mechanism distinctly impressed upon each
laborer; and in the same things must all their novices and apprentices
be instructed. They must comprehend the requirements and demands
of the farmer. They must understand the relation which exists between
chemical and mechanical principles; they must study well to adapt each
movement in their employment to the various occupations and labors
instituted by the agriculturists.  They must learn well to perfect and
condense labor, by inventing and establishing machinery within the
circumnference of the farmer's interests, in the form of saw-mills, flourmills, manufactories, and establishments for the construction of agricultural implements.

An association of mechanics may so diminish their individual liabilities and expenses, as to render machinery available to all demanders, and that at a price corresponding to the cheapness of the soil's
Productions.  As mechanics are now situated, they lose all the advantages of invention and wealth, because they are existing isolatedly,
each striving to compete with, or take advantage of, his neighbor.
They have power and wealth immense, but this being distributed
among individuals, loses in influence and profitableness: and thus
they are weak, though strong; and are contending, though one in
occupation.
An association will remedy all these evils; for instead of each mechanic having an establishment incurring individual expenses, they
may conjoin, combine their power, wisdom, and wealth, unite their
movements, and organize their laborers; and then the expenses of a
large association will not exceed those of five individual establishments as these now exist. Instead of having workshops disconnected,
they may hlave them all combined in one well-constructed establishment erected by the association, sustained by their united wealth, and
supported by the immense productions of the Agricultural Association. Every laborer could obtain provision for himself and his family with ease and without fear of destitution, becaus'e provisions would
exist in abundance. Thus cheerfully impelled onward, each mechanic would gravitate to the establishment of the association, and
enjoy a pleasure in industry.  His mind would be unclouded with
the fear of poverty and domestic necessities. He would work the
time allotted, and devote the remainder of the day to amusement,
instruction, contemplation, and investigation. He would feel an interest in labor, both for his own personal and for the general welfare.
Ite would not be fatigued with gratification or monotony-but the
hours of labor would be a relief from other pursuits in which he
might be engaged; and the variety would make existence desirable
and render it a blessing.  Such would be the situation and condition
of each member of the association.
~ 29. Each member must be interested in his own success and
the success of the whole establishment. Each one must consider his
person —his body- as living capital invested: his labor will be the
interest of that capital, which will supply his individual necessities,
and conduce to the wealth and emolument of the whole association.
For remember that labor, when justly appreciated, organized, and

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                   757
remunerated, will yield more absolute wealth than it now can, undei
the present system of fatiguing and disgusting employment.  One
man would accomplish as much in two thirds of one day, thus situated, as three would at present.  Then the reward of that labor,
being proportionate, would more than supply his necessities, and
wvould contribute to enrich the treasury of the association besides.
As labor is distributed at present among mechanics, at least one
third of the labor apparently accomplished results in no good, but an
absolute injury. Among mechanics, there are some who obstruct
the process of business and counteract the efforts of others: for what
one does is undone by another. They are like a machine disabled,
and unmoved by any adequate power, foreign or inherent. The
parts of this machine are the laborers.  They, as cogs in a wheel,
should be situated with reference to each other so as to produce harmony in their motion, and power in their action and influence. Each
man, as a cog-wheel of the machine, must be relatively and wisely
placed, in order to realize all the harmony and accomplish all the
labor desired.
On this principle must labor be organized: In the mechanical establishment, each member will have his position and labor allotted
to him by the judgment of the governor or qualified judge of justice
and industry. Each member, then, will assume a position in the
living machine of human industry in which he may assist those below
and above him, and contribute to the wealth, strength, and harmony,
of the whole.
This establishment should be near some thriving village or opulent
citv, and accessible to some seaport, so that they may hold commerce
with regions where their materials exist, and with all manufacturing
establishments in the state or states of the continent.
Their chief object must be to assist the agriculturist in his ennobling enterprise.  They must feel an interest in beautifying and perfecting the soil, so that all wants may be supplied. An association
thus constituted would not long exist before their interests would run
into and inseparably unite them with the Agriculturist Association.
For farmers, being enlightened in the science of cultivation, would
feel the immediate importance of mechanical invention, and of the
application of mechanical principles and machinery in the cultivation
of the earth. They would discover that machines, not yet in their
possession, would be useful as auxiliaries. Thus their demand for
mechanical labor would be increased. This would stimulate the as

758                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
sociation to study, construct, and perfect, machinery to suit the requirements of the soil and its cultivators.  This would give them
labor immense; and hence they could not resist the feeling of interestedness in the welfare and improvement of those requiring their
inventions.  Thus the mechanic would feel an interest in the agriculturist-the result of which would be a combination and condensation of wealth and power; and thus the whole would become an
Agri-mnechanical Association.
The bodily necessities of the multitude thus employed would create a substantial centre of interest for the various tradesmen and mechanical productors that now exist individually in society.  The
abundance of cattle and herds produced would contribute very largely
to the interests of the manufacturers of leather; and they, by following similar suggestions and improvements, would concentrate and
combine their occupation in a form so as to compete and correspond
with those who supply them with business, at a price in inverse proportion to the abundance of the stock produced.  The leather-manufacturerm would soon discover that the articles of their creation can
be supplied with more abundance and ease under this system than
under the present, and their processes would be so greatly improved
and accelerated as to enable them to manufacture their leather with
more promptness and pleasure, and then to afford the community
their productions at a price corresponding to the price of that which
they receive.
The shoe-manufacturers would then find it proper and profitable to
form themselves into a similar association.  One association in this
branch may be composed of from seventy-five to one hundred members.  With an equal distribution of labor according to individual
ability and desire, they may combine their stock, labor, and movements, and produce one third more than the same number of men at
present, under the most favorable circumstances. Each one may
have his peculiar branch allotted to him, and not be compelled to do
any more than his interest may dictate —remembering that his interest must be the interest of the association.  Similar principles of
labor and investment must be adopted as in the other associations;
and the object of their labor and productions must be centred in the
desire to supply as abundantly as possible the demands of the Agrimechanical Association and the poor in society.  Inasmuch as their

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                     759
expenses will be decreased from one third to one half, thus associated, it is agreeable to reason to suppose that what they may produce
will flow forth and supply all demands with a spontaneousness that
will encourage'every laborer and bless every destitute being.
In like manner may an association of hatters be formed —the numoer of members being the same. There should be with them the
same investment of body, interest, and labor, and the same reciprocal and harmonious movement should be established.  And the object to be attained must in every particular be similar to that of the
shoe-manufacturers.
So likewise may the clothiers or,garment-makers be joined, and be
producers of wealth and happiness upon the same reciprocal principles.
And there are minor occupations, all of which should be comprehended within the three great associations.  They may be so situated as to have their interests parallel with the interests of the organized bodies, which will be planned and elucidated by those who will
study the principles of social industry, interest, wealth, and power.
Men may pass from the present into this system without any material sacrifice, and with the full assurance of retaining their present
personal possessions; and if vigorous in their enterprise, they will
acquire muchl more.
~ 30. There is no means at first to ameliorate the condition and
curtail the labor of females.  At present, each female parent has as
much labor to accomplish in her household as three can with propriety do. The reason is clear: Every woman having a family is
obliged to struggle through isolated labor unassisted, and with domestic embarrassments which are fiequent and increasing. And the
labor of every family is as much as the labor of thrce would be if
they were situated nearer to each other, so that one large and wellconstructed machine, by the assistance of a few females, would do
all the washing of a large number of families.  And baking, sewing,
embroidery, horticulture, and all labor suitable to each qualified female, may be performed with more ease, less embarrassment, and
with delight.  These are among the progressive steps not as yet well
to urge, inasmuch as they will be the spontaneous effects of the primary movements herein recommended for the farmer and the mechanic.
The order, form, and influence, pf these co-operative associations,
will legitimately extend to the mannufacturers of cotton and wooller

760                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
fabrics;. and the action upon them will be effectual and salutary.
They will find it impossible to subsist under their present system of
labor: for the opulence and strength of the Agri-meclianical Association will indicate the possibility of establishing manufactories of a
more agreeable and productive nature.  The manufacturers, then,
will be driven to the exercise of reason and justice, a conformity to
which, however, will be found more profitable and agreeable than
their present isolated operations.  The result will be a reorganization
and condensation of labor among this class; and its remuneration
will create an interest and happiness among the operatives.
Of the cotton and wool manufacturers, the proprietors of from four
to six establishments may associate, unite their wealth, combine their
strength, and become a powerful monopoly whose influence will extend through every state and into other kingdoms.  They, like other
associationists, will discover the proper means of establishing their
interests and organizing their labor in due relation to the interests
and labor of the agriculturist and the mechanic.
In foreign kingdoms, operatives are compelled to labor firom two
thirds to three fourths of every twenty-four hours unrewarded. Their
physical energies are prostrated, their labor is misdirected, and their
productions are not much honor to the employer, being associated in
the mind with poverty, disease, and death. An association may so
direct the movements of the laborers as to make them all productive,
pleasurable, interesting, and remunerative.  Those who engage in,
and become members of, the association, may have their respective
positions assigned to them in the various branches of labor in the
establishment.  So well may they be arranged in forms, series, and
groups —in positions, movements, and qualifications —that all united
will be as a moving machine, exceedingly productive of the various
articles they conjoin to create.  In the manufactories, this system of
labor has already arrived to some degree of perfection.  Manufacturers exercise more wisdom in the distribution of labor than do most
other men.  Yet they are laboring under disadvantages and monopolizing influences, foreign and immediate, which compel them to enforce the operatives to more labor than they in justice can be required
to perform, and to reduce their compensation-and all for the purpose of overcoming, and yet sustaining, monopoly and competition.
Their form of association will be derived from  those established
before them.  The most active means must be instituted, the most
enlightened ingenuity must be exercised, and the most benevolent

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                     761
and just feelings cultivated; and these will secure harmony in their
proceedings, success in their enterprise, and unity in their stock,
strength, labor, wealth, and benevolence.
Their interests are so intimately allied to those of the wool and
cotton growers, that it will be impossible for one to thrive without
affecting the other correspondingly.  The perfection of agricultural
science, and the knowledge of the constituent parts of the vegetable
and animal forms, will give to the cultivator of the soil a controlling
influence over the mechanic and the manufacturer.  He will learn
to produce well, cheaply, and abundantly, and even not to feel the
expense of the production. The wool, selected in parcels of various
degrees of refinement, may by the Agricullurist Association be made
suitable to enter the machine to come forth in cloth for the community.
If manufacturers will not unite their operations with those of the cultivator, the mechanics, so intimately connected, will unite in establishing a manufactory for their own benefit and objects of benevolence-and thus drive those, who are not willing, to organize themselves correspondingly without, to flow into, and become members
of, the united Establishment. Once join the farmer and mechanic
in unity and benevolence of action, and the whole social world will
be obliged to follow their example, or form a close relation to the
associations that will be already established.
Thus the sympathy will be communicated from the agricultural
association to the various departments of trade, mechanism, and manufacturing. And the germ once deposited on the bosom of the soil,
will grow up unimpeded, until all other departments of society will
come into corresponding unity of action and interest..
~ 31. The next and most important movement will be among the various professions. The great load of corruption and social disease arising from their vitiating situations will then be nearly removed,,and every
member will become a useful wheel in the great machine of humanity. The immediate effect of the preceding associations will be felt
among the legal profession.  For men will have learned to exercise
the principles of legal and moral justice in their own lives, and in
the affairs of their various establishments., There will be no necessity for long and tedious suits concerning personal or real estates.
The business of chancery will be,diminished. The exercis'e of su

762                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
perficial justice will be discarded and despised; and the profession
will glory in the downfall of that which they are now convinced is
neither righteous nor beneficial in its influence.
There may then be an association of this profession consisting of
from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty members-each member
to contribute capital of valuable information to the treasury of knowledge, which the chief and best-qualified mind must preserve.  They
must not confine their attention exclusively to the principles of legal
and social jurisprudence; but they must investigate, and accumulate
valuable information to benefit the farmer, the mechanic, and the
manufacturer.  They must promote justice in the discovery and application of practical pincip~les; and this should be the chief object
of the legal association.  They may devise, according to their associated wisdom, the most agreeable social constitution similar to those
already established.
And it is proper for each member to have his field of investigation allotted to him: and all should observe the various changes
of occupation necessary to sustain physical and cultivate intellectual
health.
Their labor, then, may be distributed in this manner: Four
hours of each day may be devoted to the demonstration of the practicability of discovered principles.  Their work should pass through
the various Series, one being higher than the other, for criticism, until it reaches their governor, who shall reject or sanction their conclusions.  In one association there may be six Series.  The first or
rudimental Series should be engaged in the useful departments of
elementary science and literature.  The labors of this should be
modified and corrected by the second Series, enlarged by the third,
demonstrated by the fourth; their various ramifications may be unfolded and their practicability determined by the fifth; the whole may
be rejected or sanctioned by the sixth, which shall consist of the governor and his associates. —And thence the discoveries or principles
will flow perfected to the farmer and the mechanic, and their application will enrich the soil, bless the farmer's industry, inspire the
mechanic with confidence in the foundation of his movements, and
make his efforts successful; and their general influence will be adapted to the wants of the community, and the results will be honoring
to the legal profession, as displaying distributive justice and harmony
in their highest modes of manifestation.
This-association must be watchful of, and interested in, the various





## p. 763 (#799) ############################################


A VOICE TO MANKIND.                     763
movements of the associationists. ~ They must elucidate and explaip
all principles of justice and amicableness to each member; lecture to
them, and instruct their minds in the mysteries of Nature, her beauties, her bestowments, teachings, and requirements, and in all principles which are necessary for each individual to comprehend, for
happiness.
Four hours of each day should be thus occupied by the various
Series of the legal association.  The. governor must be the supreme
judge of equity and harmony, which he must freely dispense among
the various groups of each association when required. He and his
courtiers or associates must be the just jurors or judges of every apparent discrepancy that may occur.  Every one should repose confidence in them, because their objects and interests must be reciprocal.  They must not rest when there are any elements of dissatisfaction in any of the various groups of the community. They must
not, as they now do, wait until such disturbances involve families and
estates in long and tedious discussions; but they must be peacemakers —and go and extinguish all corrupting disaffections ere they
are fanned into a dissolving flame of passion and social contention.
Thus they will not only teach, but practise the principles of distributive justice, the tranquillizing influence of which will advance them to honor, and elevate every member in the various
associations.
Thus labor is to be distributed in this association for four hours of
each day.  The remainder of sunlight will be devoted to the cultivation of the floral kingdom, to the fine and refining arts, to amusements, to any diversion, so long as that benefits the physical and
elevates the moral being.
An association can not long exist on this wise before they will be
attracted to the beauties of the soil.  They will appreciate its blessings, and resort to it as a diversion and pleasure, and as a relief
from the incessant fatigues of wealthy gratification, and the depression of mental attention and emulation.  They will discover in labor
an attraction; and they will devote themselves, as inclination may
dictate, to the farming, mechanical, and manufacturing employments.
Some will be predisposed to the invention of machinery, to which a
portion of their time will be with pleasure and profit devoted.  Others will be interested in the artistic pursuits, employing themselves in
sculpture, portrait and landscape painting, and also in expressing
their instincts, affections, genius, and intelligence, in the multifarious

764                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
creations which will spontaneously flow from their association and
general unity of interest.
All that should be done in the way of legalizing and demonstrating
the principles of justice to the community, can be accomplished in
the brief period of four hours in each day. And in whatsoever additional pursuits they engage, their time and talents will be remunerated in proportion to all their physical and mental wants, remembering that Wisdom is to be the administrator.  Their existence will be
useful, honored, elevated, and generally purifying to all the lower
yet happy laboring classes.
Immediately will the fire of this association be communicated to
the physicians-who will form a similar association or institution,
constituted of a similar number of congenial and well-qualified members.  The medical institution will be devoted to the discovery and
arrest of disease, and not to the tiresome practice of curing diseases
which are already contracted, as is the mode at present.
This institution must also be composed of six Series, or states, orparts, the centre of which will be their Professor and Judge. Labor
is to be distributed among each Series such as they are qualified and
willing to perform.  Their interests, as a whole, will be the interest
of the other and subordinate associations.
The labor of the first Series must be to explore the physical condition and structure of every individual, and to communicate their
discoveries to the second Series.  These are to investigate the facts
and place them in a proper juxtaposition to the name of the diseased
or defective individual, and the group of which he is a member.
The statements in this form must be given to the third; analyzed by
them and given to the fourth; the proper remedies and treatment
must be stated by them and given to theffth-who will decide upon
the appropriateness of the remedy to the cause and nature of the
disease. The sixth, consisting of the Judge and Professors, will
sanction or disapprove the proposed troatment, and despatch the
proper members to officiate in the application of their remedies to
the patient.
In this way may every disease be discovered, properly understood, and most permanently cured —which never can be done under the present system of isolated investigation and practice.  Then all
professional discussions, anathemas, and denunciations, will be abolished, and conflicting systems of practice will not exist: for all will

be combined as one true system, taught and established in the nature
of things.
~ 32. Four hours of each day may be thus employed. Let the
chief object and interest be to keep the people from violation by
teaching them the constitution of their being, the necessity of obedience, and the propriety of cleanliness, exercise, and judgment, in all
their individual and social relations.  Each individual must learn the
importance of exercising a clear and potent wisdom in his living and
occupation; and the various associations must construct all the conveniences for bathing, washing, and thorough cleansing, as they are
directed by tke physicians.  They must be governed in their household relations, in their diet, in all things relating to health, according
to the dictation of the physicians.  Such must be the labor of the
physicians; and such must be its results.
Each association will reward the legal and medical institutions in
proportion to the good they accomplish in their four hours of industry, which will be vast and appreciated.  For talent will be deeply
esteemed, and proportionally remunerated. Each association will
discover that they can not succeed without the existence of the legal
and medical professions; for the first will disseminate the principles
ofjustice, and the latter the blessings of health and the knowledge of
personal physiology.  One will be indispensable to the other; and
thus they will approve, assist, and bless, each other's movements.
Another object of the medical institution must be to investigate the
principles of chemistry, physiology, allopathy, homceopathy, hydropathy, magnetism, atmospheric and solar electricity, and all things appertaining to the human body, either directly or indirectly.  They
will discover that each one of the various systems of medical practice
at present existing contains some, but not all truth, as is claimed for
each one by its respective professors.  They will discover that each
system recognises some principles susceptible of the most beneficial
application.  They must combine all the medical discoveries and
sciences, and, from a searching investigation, produce one grand and
unequivocal System of medical practice.  Let their superior wisdom
direct the application of each discovery, principle, prescription, rule
of regimen and therapeutics. And by the conventional sanction of
the judge and professors, an incontrovertible system will be established, which will arrest, overcome, and dispel, every species of
organic and functional disease.





## p. 766 (#802) ############################################


766                  A VOICE TO MANKIND.
Each Series and Degree of members must have their field of labor
and investigation so wisely adapted to their abilities as to make the
distribution of industry in the whole institution to precisely correspond with that of the associations upon which they depend, and
among which they officiate.
The remainder of the day may be devoted to social festivities and
all species of gymnastic exercises calculated to promote physical
vigor and energy of intellect.  Or they may participate in the various and agreeable branches of agriculture, mechanism, and art.
They may enter into every species of amusement, so long as an unclouded Wisdom sanctions the justice, propriety, and.profitableness
thereof.
On this wise may one legal and medical association be established;
and they will constitute an established central and attractive power,
such as can not be resisted.  Its influence will extetd over all the
relative professions, and form them into a similar community of wealth
and elevation.
And now will the highest profession be compelled (for they will not
make thie move without compulsion) to form a similar constitution, for
the unrestricted dissemination of knowledge, the crushing of prejudices, and the advancemnent of the moral and intellectual world?  The
CLERICAL profession must form  an institution for the purpose of
moral culture and spiritual progress.  And inasmuch as they are, or
at least should be, the most worthy of all professions and individuals
in the constitution of society, it is necessary to explain the most feasible and congenial plan of reforming them, so that they may reform
society.
Clergymen, associated in numbers of from fifty to seventy-five, may
organize an institution in which each member (the whole being distributed in classes) may occupy a position according to the requirements of the institute, and the use it is intended to accomplish. This
institution is to be arranged upon principles similar to those controlling others-with members so arranged as to produce an harmonious
movement, both among themselves and with reference to the community.  It is to be the seminary for instruction, especially for instruction in the higher branches of knowledge.  It is to have concentrated all the combined literature, science, philosophy, and theology, that now exist in the universities and collegiate institutions of
the land.  Their object must be to understand the depths and widths





## p. 767 (#803) ############################################


A VOTCE TO MANKIND.                     767
of natural law and science; to bring forth and analyze all the theological isms of the land; to reject the evil and preserve the good out of
the vast congregation of systems; to understand the theology of Nature,
and the manifest constitution of the Divine Mind, and to blend science, and theology, and reason, and philosophy, into one grand system of education.  They must discard all restriction of thought and
investigation, all circumscribing prejudices, all unholy teachings and
systems, that now pervade the mental world; and finally, they' must
discard all things tending to establish sects, or to promote distinction
or prejudice, and receive only that which flows spontaneously from
the indications of Nature, and the sanctions of a free and well-conconstructed judgment.  This must be the object impressed upon
such a number of clergymen before they can effectually reform the
social and moral world, and form an immoveable institution of knowledge and righteousness.
With this object duly in view, the institution may be established
in this order and form, to succeed, and bless society: Seventy-five
members are as many as should enter into one association.  These
may be divided into six classes.  To preserve form and order, they
should be situated in progressive relation to each other, so that the
six Series may be so many steps of literary, scientific, and theological
development, commencing at the primary class, and ascending to him
who presides in the sanctuary of the people.
The first class must be composed of qualified individuals whose
degree will be above the office of the highest physician in the previous institution.  They are to be the transition-step from the legal and
medical field into the scientific and philosophical.  They must take
up the various subjects where the physician leaves off. And the
results accumulated by them  must be transferred to the second degree-and so onward and upward to the sixth, who shall be the
emperor of social righteousness.  Thence their vast scientific and
spiritual accumulations will flow to the lower associations, be comprehended by them, well adapted to their wants, actualized, and made
eminently useful and practical.
~ 33. The six Degrees are all steps of relative perfection. Each
person, according as he has advanced, may be designated by the peculiar brilliancy, taste, and elegance, of his habiliments. A distinct
tion must thus be established, in order that there may be an attraction for the situation of every individual that will extend to and

elevate the lower classes.  The members in the various degrees are
to be situated in positions agreeable to their most wise desires, and
according as their abilities to sustain and render themselves useful
may suggest.
The establishment to be erected by this institution may in its architectural qualities display all the superior combinations of beauty,
use, order, form, adaptation, agreeableness, and magnificence.  It
may be decorated with examples of every mechanical and architectural invention.  It may represent in structure externally the combined contributions of art, science, and architecture, and be a standard of magnificence: and all this for the important purpose of representing the advancement of this age beyond those that are gone by,
and for the purpose of indicating the progress of the race.  The
structure should be such as to captivate all tastes and affections, and
to suit all desires in respect to order, form, and splendor; and it
should be a standing representative of the wisdom, wealth, strength,
opulence, and refinement, of the whole nation.
Interiorly, it should possess the attributes of cheerfulness, fascination, splendor, convenience, and refinement, and should imbody all
the architectural conceptions of what should be the sanctuary of human wisdom and righteousness.
It should have six apartments, which must, in structure, correspond to the degrees of their respective occupants. Each chamber,
or apartment, should possess all the conveniences suitable to the department of the association to whidch it belongs: and the appearance
of each member must fully correspond to the position occupied.
Thus the building, both internally and externally, must be adapted
to, and must correspond with, the use and end contemplated-as
also must its occupants to the offices respectively assigned to them;
and thus the whole institution will display the harmony of Wisdom
in actual demonstration.
The emperor and his courtiers and counsellors are to legislate for
the several associations within the circumference assigned to their
institution.  They are to disseminate, irrespectively, justice and
judgment to every individual-and to be the governors, presidents,
kings, or lords, to exercise justice and wisdom as derived from science and the savings of combined systems by them accumulated, analyzed, refined, and practically applied.  They are to be the governors in respect to all which subordinate classes require to bless and
make them happy. They are to have perfect confidence in the

people, which the latter, as brethren, will desire and reciprocate.
The lower associations will represent the successive developments of
the great human machine of industry and happiness; and the highcs'
or clerical institution must be the pervading power to penetrate and
start into unceasing activity all the subordinate departments of society.  They must legislate for, and apply the principles of morality,
science, and refinement, to every individual who requires, and thus
sustain a watchfulness over the whole flock, feeling desirous to perfect and perpetuate social unity, and thus contribute to the interests
and requirements of the Whole.
Seminaries and universities at present existing, are not such as
disseminate the kind of knowledge that mankind require.  And as
they are isolatedly and conventionally situated and supported, they
are not accessible to those classes who need education and refinement.  Therefore, to prevent the perpetuation of this educational
system, let an institution be formed as has been proposed.  Let the
reward which is now given.to pastors by their congregations, the
wealth lavished upon the erection and gorgeous embellishment of tha
churches and systems that are now individually or collectively supported, within a given territory, be combined and concentrated, with
the strength and intelligence of the people, into just one institution
of seventy-five members. It may be supported by the same amount
of contributions that are now made to individual societies, clergymen,
and universities.
This project can be easily accomplished by presenting the public
mind with a clear calculation and statement of the funds required,.
the movements necessary, and the amount of good to be legitimately
derived therefrom  by all.  In each county, shire, state, or kingdom,
there is wealth expended sufficient to organize and sustain more institutions of this character than will be found absolutely necessary.
Then collegiate technicalities will be bestowed upon those who arc
qualified to justly appreciate and apply the immense and useful at —
tainments which they will denote.
But the identity of these several institutions now existing will belost, and their isolated wealth will be distributed among deserving;
individuals. It will extend to the almshouse, to the asylum, to the
hospital, to the mariners' association, and to the poor of every town
and state; and it will not lose its force until it descends, by the in —
dustry of every restored and elevated being, to the soil, whence itt
will send forth an abundance to all in; return.  This all may be done:

without seriously depreciating the capital or riches of one person in
society.  On the contrary, it will enrich and advance them to honor
and happiness.
The change must be only in this particular at present, viz., that
the various sects, with their clergymen, should, instead of dividing,
unite their strength and wealth, with their bestowments upon missionaries and upon isolated institutions of education; and thus an alliance
should be effected between all sects.  Their clergymen should meet,
assisted by the same as they now receive, or any proper sum, as a
reward for their industry, and form an institution upon the principles
of distributive justice and wisdom. And those who now support
religious systems and benevolent institutions will find it much to
their advantage to cast their bestowments into the treasury of such an
enterprise; for all would be correspondingly enriched and elevated
thereby.  On this wise, then, may clergymen be improved in situa4ion, and be advanced to personal and general honor, wisdom, and
righteousness.
~ 34. The form and structure of society is now made manifest.
The formation of the agricultural, mechanical, and manufacturing
-degrees or associations of industry, strength, and wealth, are the
three movements necessary for society, that it may preserve its iden4tity, and establish a foundation on which to exist and thrive imimensely.  These are the rudimental forms necessary to establish.
They, as one, constitute the body of Love, or of reciprocal move-.ment.  The farmer, mechanic, and manufacturer, are a trinity composing one body of industry and equal distributions of labor.  They
are at the bottom, and support all else, and hence correspond to the
principle of Love contained and demonstrated in the nature of the
-divine creations.
Then the legal, medical, and clerical associations, are a trinity
forming one Whole, which corresponds to Wisdom.  The first arrange all conventional movements on the principles of equity, harmony, and practicability.  They restore all deranged- or defective
personal and conventional bodies to a state of health and harmony,'and consequently are those who recognise justice and display it with-,out distinction in their various administrations.  The second seek
out and restore all the subjects of disease, whether personal or general, to a state of health and strength; and thus assist the legal profession in their occupation and influence.  The third accumulate

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    771
science, art, theology, and philosophy, which they make perfect and
practicable. These they disseminate among, and freely apply to,
the members of each association, as they in wisdom desire or require.
Hence the clerical institution will be the great court of justice, the
temple of liberty, and the sanctuary of knowledge and righteousness.
Their influence, in practice, will proclaim, " Fear not, for behold we
bring you glad tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people."
The response will be, "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace,
good-will to men."
Thus the legal, medical, and clerical associations, are three parts
of one whole system, which corresponds to Wisdom. So the structure of society will be an imitation of the structure of the Universe;
and its Soul will be like the structure of the Divine Mind, which is
Love and Wisdom.  The kingdom of heaven will be on earth, and
under its dominion each one may repose in undisturbed confidence,
fulfil the destiny of his being, and glorify the unbounded blessings
of higher spheres.
Family forms, sympathies, and relations, it is proper to preserveinasmuch as it is not necessary to change any of the conjugial attachments that now exist, to successfully establish the principles and
movements of an association.  Directions concerning these things
will naturally arise from the wisdom and investigation consequent on
such a social organization.
But education, both primary and scientific, needs to be essentially
changed: that is, there must not exist so many and dissimilar modes
of impressing youthful minds with doctrine instead of practice, and
with useless instead of practicable principles.  There must exist a
unity in education, and a progress in administering instruction to the
young.  And, agreeably with the sympathies and present prejudices
of every family, the present system may be essentially and profitably
modified in the following nlanner:The Agricultural Association may have a department and system
of rudimental instruction for their young, in which may be taught
the primary rules of orthography, etymology, syntax, and prosody.
These should perfect the instruction in this department.
The Mechanical Association may have a system in unity of plan
with the latter, taking from this lower branch into their own hands
the charge of the education which may be given to their children.
This stage of education should range from the primary, through geography, arithmetic, and mathematics, comprehending all the primary

772                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
principles of mechanism, and the general principles of the whole
Agri-nechanical Association.
The manufacturers will likewise adopt a system of educating their
young —which will proceed from the general education of the latter
class into its various ramifications, and will also consist in practically
demonstrating the principles impressed on their children in the school
of the mechanics.
The legal association may have a seminary for taking up the various instructions of the last system, and carrying them on through the
rudimental branches of their own attainments.
And so the medical and clerical associations must proceed-the
latter to bestow every species of valuable information in possession
of the race. They are to teach none other than sound, unprejudicial, and practical principles of life and happiness. And the instructions in this department are to be considered the completion of every
proper and useful education.
The various associations may have systems thus successively established, so that in the ascension from the farmer's to the highest institution, one perfect system of education may be completed.
It will be discovered (according to various writers on education)
that children should not be mentally fatigued with instructions derived from books, a monitor, or anything that may interfere with the
natural process of the development of their tender faculties; and that
an age of from six to eight years is necessary for each child to attain
before being introduced into any school of education. In this way
all fatigue may be escaped, and all youthful interest for instruction be
preserved.
At the age of eight years, the natural predisposition and mental
and physical qualifications of each child will be sufficiently unfolded
to indicate to the parent the kind of education or employment which
would be agreeable and proper.  It will be found that some children
will pass from the farmer's family through all the systems, until they
attain a high seat in the people's sanctuary. And this will be determined by the innate aspirations of the mind indicated even in childhood.  If the child is born amid the circumstances of the agriculturist, and if, as the faculties unfold, he indicates a disposition for
science and philosophy, and manifests a general veneration, he should
pass directly from the primary school to the legal, and thence to the
clerical. If a child is inclined to the medical profession, let his inclinations be cultivated, and let him pass directly from the primary





## p. 773 (#809) ############################################


A  UICE TO MANKIND.                    773
to the medical school, where he will receive his required instruction.
A pre-qualification and predisposition should never escape the observation of a parent, in any of his children.  His convictions.must
be communicated to the institution to which the child is by nature
attracted, and by which its education will be freely given.
~ 35. It will also be discovered that some children born amid the
circumstances of the legal, medical, and clerical profession, will be,
disqualified for any of these, and by nature will gravitate to the mechanical or agricultural employment.  So there will be an equal and
just exchange of desires and attractions among the children of each
association, which will gratify their parents, and banish all social disturbance from the community.
On these principles will education of every low and high degree
be perfected-distributing equality or preference to all according to
innate ability and natural attraction.
As men are at present situated, education does violence in many
instances, both to body and mind.  Some who are now debased, digging the trench, laying the wall, or slavishly tilling the earth, are better qualified by nature to be physicians, or teachers of science, than
many of those who are thus situated.  Many who are now clergymen would be in their element if in the workshop or in the field. So
with many physicians, lawyers, manufacturers, and mechanics.  Men
are now compelled to engage, for a subsistence, in that in which it
is neither their nature nor desire to engage.  This is the reason why
the various professions have men who dishonor their employment
and prostitute their superficial education.  And so men in the various branches of farming and manufacturing who do not succeed in
their employment, being always dissatisfied, striving to escape from
their situations, and being finally compelled to remain, lose all interest in their avocations, and are neither useful to themselves nor to
society. Details concerning these important truths may be found in
the writings of valuable men who have thought upon add investigated
the causes of social disunity, and unfolded the errors of present edul.
cation. But it would not be important to multiply examples in this
place. Yet these can be perceived by every enlightened mind who
van distinguish the relation between cause and effect.
Association would remedy all these evils-would not only cultivate all the good interests of the human soul, but give them a truthful
and proper direction.  Mfen who are now engaged in the varioLs

modes of employment, would at once gravitate to that which is most
congenial to their nature and qualifications.  Children would inevitably do the same; and therefore an equality would be the highest
result of such a social and educational organization. Every facility
Inust be conceived and practised by the superior association, for the
purpose of instructing and refining each child and parent.
Women, in each association, should exercise as much taste as the
men-inasmuch as they suggest all the life-imparting impulses to
the male department.  They must cultivate and display their conceptions of the beautiful as manifested in any of the delicate arts and
sciences, which must be among the chief objects of the ascending
and superior associations to cultivate.  The floral kingdom  can be
greatly advanced in beauty, order, and instruction.  All the high degrees of beauty which may be displayed in dress and ornament, and
the various possessions sanctioned by the wisdom of the governor,
can be derived from the delicate textures of flowers.  This may be
the primary field of the females.
Thence they may ascend to the refined arts of painting, embroidcry, and all the higher branches as relating to beauty and grandeur,
and cultivate all the lovely conceptions of Nature and art.  These
things must be the essential attraction of the female.  And she will
receive all the accomplishments which a superior wisdom can dispense, and which well-constructed institutions abundantly possess.
Thus the education of youth, male and female, may be conducted;
nnd the result will be a total destruction of all disunity now caused
by individuals occupying situations for which they by nature are in
no wise qualified.
Such must be the Body, and the miovements within must be the
Soul, of society.  The superior or clerical association should thus
be the seat of justice, legislation, and dispensation; and all subordinate ones will perform  the important offices assigned them.  And
from the harmony and unity of the whole, will proceed SOCIAL HAPPINESS AND SPIRITUAL ELEVATION.
One facility, one most powerful engine of freedom and of the distribution of thought, must be attached to the superior association; and
thus be a part of it, and that is THE PRESS.  This wields an omnipotent sceptre over the public mind, and is a rightful -vehicle for the
dissemination of personal, local, scientific, and general information.
A printing department, then, should be composed of a congregation





## p. 775 (#811) ############################################


A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    775
of present proprietors, and conducted upon the most expeditious principles which the science of mechanism can without difficulty supply.
A multitude of presses may be governed by one well-constructed engine, and labor may be so distributed as that as much labor as is at
present accomplished may be performed in one third of the time.
This must form an important part of the superior association.
The interest of printers must be concentrated on the great end of
social unity, and on the equal distribution of knowledge.  Until they
agree to this, there will exist as much disunity in their pursuits as
now exists.  Those who are competent to preside at the editorial
table should perceive at a glance the consistency of this proposed
system.  They, moreover, should exert their influence in promulgating the high principles of magnanimity and benevolence of soul.
One truth, however, is particularly impressive, and that is, that if
he who wields the pen to inform the public mind through journals
and books of the day, does not perceive the importance of these principles of social reform, he is most certainly not qualified for the office
which he is compelled by circumstances to occupy.  A movement
can not be depended upon as commencing in this class, but only
among the laboring classes —the farmers andthe mechanics-who,
when once organized, will draw the social world into their consociable embrace.
The mercantile business as now existing will be essentially changed.
The provisions sold by the grocer will be procured from the Establishment of the farmers. And this will consequently compel those of this
branch to congregate into a large association, or submit to be attracted into the various employments adopted by the six associations.
The same destiny awaits those who are now engaged in the retail of
manufactured goods: for the manufacturers will also have an Establishment for their productions-which will be distributed according
to increasing demands. And thlis will be more convenient and profitable than to have their productions gyrate through the hands of the
tradesmen, which is nothing more nor less than advancing the first
profits to a price almost equal to the cost of the goods primarily.
The detached mechanics in villages and cities will be drawn intc
the associations, for they can not exist separate from them.
~ 36. Finally, the rudimental movements of the association must
begin on these gentle principles; and then they will gradually modify

776                 A VOICE TO MANKIND.
the present system, until it is resolved into a new one. This plan
will not offend established prejudices, nor disturb the present relations of families, friends, and social organizations; but it will address
itself to those who are advanced and prepared to enter immediately
on this grand and elevating enterprise of social and moral reformation.
I am not impressed to enter into details concerning the advanced
stages of the reorganization, nor of the movements required-as
these will be for future consideration, and the careful investigation
of their promulgators.  Wisdom and circumstances will govern the
details of the several associations; and therefore it would be premature to attempt now to unfold the subject.
The machinery, the structure, the primary movements have thus
been suggested and explained; and if they are in their essential
teachings obeyed, the legitimate consequences will be the peace and
happiness which the race desires.
This will be the era of peace.  And remarkable as it may appear,
it is true that the most prominent writers, firom the time of Confucius
iald Zoroaster to the present century, have spoken of this period
with a great deal of prophetic delight.  Each one has contributed
some principles that are true and practicable.  They descend from
tie heathen philosophers, and flow through the Old and New Testaments, and are presented in various forms at the present day.
SwVEDENBORG has done more than any other person to accumulate, sift, and preserve, the useful productions of each nation: and
he has formed them into a system that is practicable and serviceable
to every mind. Yet they can not now be understood or applied so
extensively as when the superior Association is formed, and their
wisdom is concentrated for the purpose of accumulating and applying
all truths.
Heretofore I have referred to the several revelations that have been
given by mer in every century within the limits of national chronology.  Their teachings in the main are important.  They can only
be proved so, and applied with a benefit, after society is formed into
a closer and more agreeable relation.
Now it is made manifest that the teachings of Jesus were descriptions of effects to flow legitimately from such a social organization.
And likewise the prophets indulged in the same delightful anticipations of glorious effects to be one day enjoyed on earth.  Men have
not distinguished properly, in examining the teachings of Jesus, the

A VOICE TO MANKIND.                    777
nature and relation of cause and effect.  These they have confounacd,
and generally the effects described by him are taken for primary causes
to reform society.  The golden rule, the feeling of brotherly love,
love to the neighbor, and such like, are not causes, but effects, which
will be realized and consummated ere long on earth. He taught
what should be, not that which would produce it: he spoke of effects,
not causes.  He spoke of unity, and spiritual consolation, elevation,
and hLappincss; but not of social evils, their causes, and the means to
remove them.
Then he who loves and admires the doctrines of this great and
glorious Reformer, should abandon immediately the preaching of
effects, and exercise his wisdom to reconstruct society-to introduce
causes which may harmonize social interests, so that those very desirable efects may be realized.  He who would honor his Master
(or the type of the human race, which is Jesus), must abandon mere
speecth, and proceed to action.  Preach in deed, and not in speech.
Cease unmeaning prayers, and go forth into the sinks of social
wretchedness and desolation, and offer an assisting, hand, which is a
prayer divinely manifested.  Discrimination must be made between
the causes of social evil and the effects of brotherly kindness and
charity, which latter only were described by the elevated moral Reformer. This being done, no man will be called a heretic if he proposes movements of reform not intimated in the teachings of Jesus;
for one thing is certain-that no man can transcend the principles
of these teachings in his most active imaginations of social unity and
peace, inasmuch as they are the highest principles of social and
moral reciprocation.  This once acknowledged, and it will be conceded that he honors the teachings of Jesus, who is active in instituting principles and movements of reform, so that the grand effect of
love to the neighbor may be fully and unchangeably established.
Recurrence to the writings of Charles Fourier is necessary for the
purpose of bringing his social system before the worfl, so that mankind may investigate it, and give a just verdict as to its truth, morality, and practicability.  It is impossible to escape the conclusion
that he revealed many truthful causes and principles of reform that
must be in some degree practised before the kingdom of heaven can
be established on earthi.  I am impressed, then, to suggest that those
who engage in the reform should accumulate the various principles
and suggestions of moral and philosophical writers.  They must

discover how much real truth each author imbodies, its relation to
present existing evils, the extent of its application, and the results if
practised.
The great movements of the day are all advancing the public to
this desirable consummation.  The efforts for the abolition of slavery; those for the repeal of capital punishment; the reform of prisondiscipline; the temperance reformation; the liberality of the various
sects; the general open demand of the public mind for sonme relief
from  social and mental embarrassments; the agitations in various
portions of Europe; the elevation of the public morals; the manifest
sympathies toward the poor and degraded; the excitement among
the inhabitants of Scotland for the relief of their poor; the general
condition of France; the liberal investigations of Germany; the researches among the tombs and monuments of Egypt, revealing the
truths of national antiquity; the absolute predominance of facts over
imagination, and truth over error; the general condition of the heathen world; and finally the movements among every nation of the
earth, both social, scientific, and spiritual-all proclaim the approach
of this sublime era.
Our country, its interests, wealth, and government, are fearfully
involved in a peace-destroying war, the result of which will be a
powerful reaction on every mind; and this will accelerate the insinuation of these principles, and their practice.  The era is nigh: the
judgment-day, when wisdom shall predominate, will soon arrive;
and this will banish ignorance, error, prejudice, and fanaticism, from
the earth.  A general revolution is at hand.  It is already kindled —
Wisdom will fan the sparks into a flame, and this will consume contention and sin, and all will come forth purified, elevated, HAPPY!
This is the flame of LOVE-the consuming vengeance of TRUTH
and GOODNEss.  For it is a fact that whatever new truth is presented to the world, no matter how gentle, lovely, and fascinating,
it may be, it is to establish a prejudice like a consuming fire of vengeance.  Hence it is opposed: and the conflict demonstrates the
difference between truth and error, reason and fanaticism.  But the
prospect is clear-the purifying fire of Love, Truth, and Knowledge, will consume all else, and vengeance will only be manifested
in the conflict of established prejudices.
~ 37. Such is the era foreseen by David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and.Malachi. Such was the period impressed

upon Confucius, Zoroaster, Brama, Jesus, Mohammed, Fourier, and
upon male and female writers of every century down to the present
day. It was sung in the Orphic hymns of Egypt, described in the
writings of heathen poets and philosophers, preached and anticipated
by Paul, and metaphorically described by John in the A'pocalypse.
It is that which gives consolation to every writer who feels the importance of a social reformation; and it is that which inspires the
bosom of every philanthropist, gives consolation to the depressed,
hope to the disquieted, promise to the philosopher, and an asylum to
the admirer of Nature and worshipper of her manifestations.
Unspeakable inducements have been presented to an aspiration
for this sublime consummation: for behold the deepest and most secret recesses of Nature have been searched, and their immense possessions revealed.  The magnificence of the material Universe; its
undying energies, qualities, essences, and combinations of beautyhave been unfolded and brought forth unexaggerated. From the
central power of terrestrial creation, the successive degrees of development; the manifestations of each step; the results of each creation;
the unvarying tendencies of all, their teachings and their practicability, have been shown forth in their enchanting grandeur.  The creation of the earth; the form, essence, and production, of each kingdom; the general concentration of power in the creation of man; his
attributes; his social and spiritual qualifications; his unlimited and
righteous exercise of power over the various created things beneath
him; the relative positions and offices which he and the subordinate
creations sustain, and the unity, order, wisdom, grandeur, and excellency of all divine developments, have all been unfolded to man.
More than this, the stupendous grandeur of the spiritual habitations
has been reflected upon his spiritual vision.  Their celestial attractions, their dispensations, their requirements, have been presented
to the lively and willing intellect of man.  The grand architecture
of all terrestrial and celestial things has been presented in a true form
for the purpose of impelling man onward and upward in the improvement of his natural life and spiritual being.
The laws of Nature have been clearly unfolded, from which may
be drawn a code of just and righteous laws of social government.
These have been applied to society, and directions have been given
for their practice. Society has been arranged so as to represent the
material and spiritual creations of the Divine Mind-so that an
equal harmony may pervade it, which may restore the disunited and

conflicting race to the bosom of Nature, tb her principles, and to the
love of God.
Then, tillers of the soil —rgriculturists- who among your vast
number shall be the first to deposite the germ of social happiness,
and bless your brethren?  Multitudinous as you are, are there not
six among you ready in social and moral culture to enter upon this
glorious enterprise?  Mechanics, who among you shall first manifest
the righteousness of your cause, your industry, your art, as the art
of Nature?  Who among your number shall be the advocates of distributive justice, attractive labor, and a proper compensation? Manjhfacturers, will you not concentrate your wealth and power to effect
a general good, and assist all co-workers in the vineyard of industry
and happiness?
Lawyers, who among you shall give thefirst inimpulse, and promulgate and establish these principles of association, of justice, of human
brotherhood?  Who in your vast numbers is qualified to ascend to
the honorable'seat of government, to be a supreme judge?  Who
shall bring forth his energies, his mental strength, to accomplish this
desirable end?  Physicians, in your midst, who is tile one to be the
grand professor and governor of your elevated and useful occupation? Who shall ascend to the various degrees of honor and usefilness?  Clergymen, what one among you is qualified to be the
grand king and lord of social righteousness, such as shall be derived
firom the laws of Nature, and shall flow to and comprehend every,
being of the earth?  Who shall be the number to congregate and
legislate for the people?  Who shall prove by actual demonstration
that he is a nobleman by nature, and a philanthropist in action?
Who among you shall go forth and disseminate the principles of social reform, preach the kingdom of heaven, dispense intelligence, and
elevate the depressed? Upon you and your holy proceedings depends the success of those teachings which it has been the burden
of every intelligent mind'to conceive-and suppress, for the want of
mental liberty.
Agriculturists, mechanics, manufacturers —do you not feel the
importance of changing your own and your laborers' situations?of supplying all wants, and establishing universal industry? Lawyers, physicians, clergymen-do you not feel the omnipotence of
Nature's truths?  Do you not see that they are immortal and can
not die?  Give ear to her proclamations and her admonitions, and
proceed to change your situations in life, and strive to represent the

heavenly societies on earth. Nature demands obedience. Upor.
her and her laws depends your misery or happiness. She everywhere proclaims this truth: that at her hand is the punishment of
every vice, and the reward of every virtue; that in her bosom  is
nourishment and inexhaustible provisions for all her creatures-but
that they must bow in submission to her commands to receive her
spontaneous bestowments.
Finally, I will leave you all to interrogate Nature and the Divine
Mind, to determine whether error shall reign instead of truth, vice
instead of virtue, misery instead of happiness, or contention instead
f;i' harmony.  I discover that your inquiries will be fully and satistactorily answered, your reason convinced, your minds elevated,
your movements righteous, expeditious, and immediate. And the
results thereof will be the destruction of all sorrow, and the usheringin of joy unspeakable and blessings immense. This once accomplished, and behold —your uncultivated fields, dense and fearful
forests, untraversed morasses, barren deserts, gloomy wildernesses,
are all beautiful gardens, yielding the choicest productions of earth.
Happy villages are visible in every direction.  Valleys are teeming
with all the excellences of life and industry.  These bespeak prosperity and happiness.  Even your valleys are exalted, your rough
and impassable places are made smooth, the crooked and fantastic
are made straight and beautiful, and all nations rejoice in social unity
and righteousness!
Innumerable contributions of science and art are derived from every village. In every continent, nations converse through the medium of the electric fire. Powerful engines are in motion perfecting
commerce, convenience, safety, wealth, and science. Every port is
thrown open, and each county enjoys the blessings of unrestricted
intercourse with all others.  Mutual exchanges are made, reciprocal
justice is displayed, and a halo of peace is the crown of every nation.  The deserts are cultivated and bring forth abundantly.  The
wilderness blossoms as the rose.  Earth is a terrestrial heaven, peopled with superior beings, typifying in their lives the grandeur and
holiness of Paradise.  All contention, all strife and national animosities, have for ever ceased.  The flag of Liberty is unfurled, and the
ocean of Truth is rising, and the fount of Love is on earth, springing
up unto everlasting life.  Behold-every child of the Eternal One
is laboring with pleasure in the field, in the departments of science,
in the courts of justice, in the temple of health, or in the sanctuary

of peace and brotherly love! Each one is situated as is prescribed
by Nature and her Creator. His kingdom has come, his will is done
on earth as it is in heaven.-And all rest even while they are beautifying and gardenizing the soil.  Strength, opulence, grandeur, and
glory, are visible in every department of social life. None are weak,
depressed, diseased: all are strong, elevated, healthy.  The milenniumn-the day of peace-the era of righteousness-is established.
Everything proclaims glory, and honor, and immortal life. Nothing
is lost —all are saved.  He who rules omnipotent hath spoken from
the solitary deserts, and from the monuments and persecutions of
ages bygone. He has revealed his character in every particle, leaf,
flower, and tree, and arched the heavens with his glory.  He has
impressed on man the express image of his nature and attributes.
He has crowned him the lord of creation.  He has elevated, refined,
and perfected, the formerly-misdirected race of man, and brought the
whole to the fulness of the stature of a PERFECT BEING!
Such will be the appearance of the earth ere long!  The vision
indicates prosperity and peace.  It is an object for which all should
labor; it is an end yet to be accomplished; it will be: but who among
you, brethren, shall deposite the gcrm, establish the nucleus-the
central power-of righteousness?  Your reason-your unclouded
intellects-will decide.  To prove your superiority, your innate
magnanimity and goodness of soul, do not rest in pain while you
may be active in undying pleasure. All that has been promised in
every age to this century, will be fully realized.  When distributive
justice pervades the social world, then virtue and morality will bloom
with an immortal beauty.  The sun of righteousness will arise in
the horizon of universal industry, and shed its genial rays over all the
feitls of peace plenty, and human happiness!
